* At that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ vehicles was a personal _RARE_ for such employees , and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly _RARE_ . STO
* Once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly . STO
* And reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth . STO
* Table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees . STO
* This rate of increase does not _RARE_ anything in itself . STO
* It does not indicate loose management , _RARE_ controls or poor policy . STO
* But it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees . STO
* In the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now . STO
* Whether there were too few automobiles in _RARE_ or too many now is _RARE_ . STO
* The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them . STO
* _RARE_ and operation of the motor pool . STO
* While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly . STO
* _RARE_ to 1942 , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned . STO
* This responsibility included all phases of management . STO
* It _RARE_ determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where repairs were to be made , where _RARE_ and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters . STO
* In 1942 , however , the nation was at war . STO
* _RARE_ and automobile tires were _RARE_ commodities . STO
* The state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual . STO
* It met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more _RARE_ called the motor pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation . STO
* The motor pool then , as now , had _RARE_ facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state . STO
* It was _RARE_ the responsibility of the Department of Public _RARE_ and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation . STO
* In 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the _RARE_ Department of Administration , an agency established as the central staff and _RARE_ department of the state government . STO
* The management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner : `` Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made . STO
* The agencies of government are now _RARE_ for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars . STO
* Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the _RARE_ system plus other control _RARE_ has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis . STO
* One indication of the _RARE_ of the new management is found in the fact that during the period _RARE_ , while total annual _RARE_ put on the vehicles increased _RARE_ , the total maintenance cost increased only _RARE_ . STO
* `` In order to further _RARE_ the management of passenger vehicles , on July 1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by _RARE_ Order , to the Division of _RARE_ , Research and Office Services . STO
* The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles . STO
* ( Note : So far as State Police cars are concerned , only their replacement is under this division ) . STO
* This tied in closely with the current attempt to _RARE_ state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive . STO
* Moreover , it allows the present management to _RARE_ vehicles so that _RARE_ will be more _RARE_ distributed throughout the _RARE_ ; ; for example , if one driver puts on _RARE_ miles per year and another driver _RARE_ miles per year , their cars will be switched so that both cars will have _RARE_ miles after two years , rather than _RARE_ miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and _RARE_ miles respectively '' . STO
* The motor pool is a completely centralized and _RARE_ operation . STO
* It _RARE_ all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrates more on `` service station activities '' than on extensive vehicle repairs . STO
* It contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work . STO
* Where the pool _RARE_ is in its compilation of maintenance and _RARE_ studies and analyses . STO
* _RARE_ records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per _RARE_ of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be _RARE_ for sound economies . STO
* From this , motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data . STO
* In _RARE_ , vehicles averaged an operating cost of _RARE_ per mile . STO
* _RARE_ on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of _RARE_ for use of _RARE_ vehicles . STO
* They estimate further that with sufficient experience and when _RARE_ of _RARE_ cars is compiled , the _RARE_ point may be reduced to _RARE_ miles of travel per year . STO
* Table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random . STO
* One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities . STO
* Present pool quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded , _RARE_ and , in general , make for _RARE_ operation in terms of _RARE_ of personnel and _RARE_ of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment . STO
* Good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more . STO
* _RARE_ practices . STO
* The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state . STO
* _RARE_ are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made . STO
* _RARE_ are evaluated by the Division of _RARE_ with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible _RARE_ . STO
* Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public . STO
* The reasons are obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buying in quantity , and ( 2 ) it has no federal _RARE_ or state sales tax to pay . STO
* Until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of _RARE_ discount through the _RARE_ . STO
* In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool , cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier . STO
* This is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately _RARE_ principles . STO
* The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later . STO
* _RARE_ purchase , assignment , and use policies Probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles . STO
* The _RARE_ role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles . STO
* The more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration . STO
* The Rhode Island property tax There was a time some years ago when local _RARE_ by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well . STO
* For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax . STO
* This tax was discontinued in _RARE_ . STO
* Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial _RARE_ on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years . STO
* At the same time there has been an _RARE_ and expansion of municipal services as well . STO
* Thus , there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments . STO
* This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , _RARE_ for their requirements . STO
* Consequently there have developed several forms of _RARE_ and shared taxes , as well as the _RARE_ grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level . STO
* _RARE_ state aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax . STO
* This is being done both by the _RARE_ of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property _RARE_ neglected or ignored . STO
* _RARE_ of tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a `` hands off '' nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in the main , are not well paid and have inadequate office _RARE_ , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the _RARE_ of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property . STO
* _RARE_ of taxing personal property . STO
* Among the many problems in the taxing of personal property , and of movable tangible property in particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) _RARE_ , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value . STO
* These problems are not local to Rhode Island , but are recognized as common to all states . STO
* _RARE_ of property . STO
* Although the laws of the various states , in general , specify the _RARE_ of property , i.e. , residence or _RARE_ of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regarding boats , airplanes , mobile homes , etc. , seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper _RARE_ point for assessment . STO
* Rhode Island law _RARE_ that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated . STO
* It also provides for the _RARE_ of all personal property , belonging to inhabitants of the state , both tangible and _RARE_ , and the tangible personal property of _RARE_ in this state . STO
* In _RARE_ personal property , it specifically _RARE_ `` all ships or vessels , at home or abroad '' . STO
* _RARE_ property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of _RARE_ the greater portion of the year . STO
* Although a similar _RARE_ for tangible property is mentioned in the statute , this is _RARE_ out by the provision that definite kinds of property `` and all other tangible property '' situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated . STO
* This would seem to fix the tax _RARE_ of all movable personal property at its location on December 31 . STO
* Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles . STO
* The location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is _RARE_ . STO
* Obviously , it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the _RARE_ day of December . STO
* In view of the acceptance _RARE_ the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft . STO
* A recent example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes , on December 31 , 1960 , from the Newport _RARE_ in _RARE_ , to the North Central _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* This situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ bases its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all _RARE_ property , both tangible and _RARE_ , shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of _RARE_ for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of April in each year '' . STO
* The _RARE_ tax _RARE_ , in turn , claims the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town , in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated '' . STO
* _RARE_ of value . STO
* This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to _RARE_ in that the determination of fair _RARE_ is dependent on local assessors , who in general are _RARE_ and _RARE_ personnel taking an _RARE_ approach to the problem . STO
* This accounts for the wide _RARE_ in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in Rhode Island . STO
* This condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established , or through _RARE_ agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted . STO
* The Rhode Island Public _RARE_ Council in its publication once commented : `` The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property . STO
* An adequately _RARE_ and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable _RARE_ on all properties throughout the State . STO
* A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and _RARE_ that are inherent in a system of _RARE_ different and independent assessing units '' . STO
* The Institute of Public Administration , in its report to the State _RARE_ _RARE_ Commission in 1959 , recommended `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency _RARE_ organized and equipped for the job '' . STO
* The resulting setup , it was declared , `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode Island '' . STO
* _RARE_ in Rhode Island . STO
* To determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island . STO
* The replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case . STO
* There are _RARE_ reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town . STO
* These opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time . STO
* In reply to a question of whether they now tax boats , airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles , nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not . STO
* The _RARE_ of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations . STO
* One _RARE_ checked boats only , another _RARE_ and _RARE_ , one mentioned house _RARE_ , and two others referred to _RARE_ without _RARE_ the type . STO
* In two cases , airplanes only were indicated . STO
* It is difficult to _RARE_ exactly what was meant in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not _RARE_ movable personal property , and of the remainder only certain types are _RARE_ for tax purposes . STO
* _RARE_ were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats . STO
* It would seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be _RARE_ for that particular kind of personal property . STO
* So few answered the question relating to their efforts to _RARE_ movable property that the results are _RARE_ . STO
* Only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind . STO
* Of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was _RARE_ according to its location or ownership . STO
* Fifteen stated that it was according to location , four by residence of the owner , and nineteen did not answer . STO
* _RARE_ assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property , and only five were opposed . STO
* Seven others expressed no opinion . STO
* On this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now . STO
* It is not clear , however , whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats , _RARE_ , aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be _RARE_ to their particular towns . STO
* Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner . STO
* _RARE_ voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner _RARE_ . STO
* Ten others made no reply . STO
* Of those who have an opinion , it seems that assessment by location is preferred . STO
* There was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date . STO
* To _RARE_ , it may be said that there is no one _RARE_ practice in Rhode Island with respect to the _RARE_ of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge . STO
* The need for greater knowledge is evident from their replies . STO
* _RARE_ as personal property taxing of boats . STO
* Interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats . STO
* _RARE_ in Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a _RARE_ upon real and personal property , but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax `` a sum not less than nor more than '' a specified amount as ordered by a city _RARE_ or financial town meeting . STO
* It has been obvious to the assessors , particularly those in shore communities , that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach . STO
* Through their professional organization , the Rhode Island Tax _RARE_ Association the question of taxing boats long has been _RARE_ and discussed . STO
* No satisfactory solution has been found , but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or _RARE_ on the part of the assessors . STO
* It has been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars , excluding commercial boats . STO
* It is obvious that this is a potential and _RARE_ source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to _RARE_ . STO
* It is known that at least five towns ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Newport and _RARE_ ) place some value on some boats for tax purposes . STO
* However , few are taxed , and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town _RARE_ . STO
* No one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be . STO
* _RARE_ more than _RARE_ boats were registered with the Coast _RARE_ prior to the recent passage of the state _RARE_ law . STO
* Only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of _RARE_ and _RARE_ at the end of the 1960 _RARE_ season , but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close . STO
* The _RARE_ association , meeting at _RARE_ in September 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem . STO
* Local industry's investment in Rhode Island was the big story in _RARE_ industrial development effort . STO
* _RARE_ companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction , _RARE_ _RARE_ square feet and representing an investment of _RARE_ ; ; a new _RARE_ War 2 , record . STO
* With minor exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here . STO
* What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business _RARE_ throughout the nation , Rhode Island _RARE_ marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs . STO
* Of the major _RARE_ in 1960 , three were financed under the R. I. Industrial _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ mortgage plan : _RARE_ _RARE_ , Leesona Corporation , and American _RARE_ & _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ firms that arranged their own financing included _RARE_ Corporation , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Inc. Division of _RARE_ , _RARE_ Gray _RARE_ _RARE_ , W. R. Cobb Company , and _RARE_ _RARE_ Company . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility of the Development _RARE_ Industrial Division , and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year's operation . STO
* Industrial Division personnel worked with _RARE_ out-of-state and _RARE_ Rhode Island concerns during 1960 , many of whom are still interested in a Rhode Island location . STO
* They are conscious of this _RARE_ new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island . STO
* _RARE_ to small business Although much of the Industrial _RARE_ _RARE_ effort is devoted to securing new locations and _RARE_ by major industries , small business is also _RARE_ considerable attention . STO
* Our Office of Foreign and _RARE_ Commerce carries on a vigorous program , directly aimed at _RARE_ and _RARE_ the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories . STO
* A primary function is the operation of a Government _RARE_ Center , which receives _RARE_ daily from the Federal Government's principal _RARE_ agencies . STO
* _RARE_ is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen concerning interpretation of _RARE_ _RARE_ , where to obtain _RARE_ , and _RARE_ concerning _RARE_ . STO
* During the past year , _RARE_ government _RARE_ _RARE_ were received and _RARE_ procurement leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers . STO
* In addition , the _RARE_ domestic trade program provided _RARE_ services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses ; ; how and where to apply for financial assistance ; ; details on _RARE_ ; ; information concerning patents , _RARE_ and trade marks , availability of technical reports , and other subjects of interest to small business . STO
* The Office of Foreign and _RARE_ Commerce is also active in the field of international trade , _RARE_ Rhode Island firms in developing and _RARE_ markets abroad . STO
* This office _RARE_ with the U. S. Department of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include : statistics on markets abroad ; ; locating foreign agents , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , etc. ; ; information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad , and _RARE_ requirements concerning _RARE_ shipments and arrangements for payment . STO
* During the year 1960 , this office supplied _RARE_ visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce , and made _RARE_ field visits . STO
* _RARE_ program Our _RARE_ advertising continued , during 1960 , its previous effective program that stressed such _RARE_ as _RARE_ financing , plant _RARE_ , and location advantages . STO
* We also continued to run a series of ads _RARE_ _RARE_ of Rhode Island by _RARE_ who had recently established new plants here . STO
* To reach a still greater audience of _RARE_ manufacturers , our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from _RARE_ to _RARE_ , and the Industrial _RARE_ _RARE_ financial participation was _RARE_ from _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ advertising was mainly concentrated in the New York Times and the _RARE_ Street Journal ( Eastern and _RARE_ editions ) which averaged two prominent ads per month , and to a _RARE_ degree the New York Herald Tribune and , for the west coast , the Los Angeles Times and the _RARE_ Street Journal ( Pacific Coast edition ) . STO
* In addition to the regular schedule , _RARE_ were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New York Times , Boston Herald , American _RARE_ , _RARE_ News and , for local promotion , the Providence Sunday Journal . STO
* _RARE_ advertising included _RARE_ _RARE_ , The New _RARE_ , U. S. _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The direct mail campaign consisted of 3 _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics , plastics , _RARE_ , and business machine manufacturers , and to _RARE_ . STO
* These _RARE_ _RARE_ pieces of correspondence . STO
* The 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of _RARE_ inquiries ; ; _RARE_ from _RARE_ and 75 from direct mail . STO
* Two hundred and nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from foreign countries . STO
* New York led in the number of inquiries , followed by California , New Jersey , _RARE_ , and Pennsylvania . STO
* Among foreign countries _RARE_ were Germany , Canada , Brazil and India . STO
* Industrial promotion An important operation in _RARE_ industrial locations involves what we term `` _RARE_ calls '' by one of this _RARE_ industrial promotion specialists . STO
* These consist of visits , without previous announcement , on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly _RARE_ areas . STO
* More than 25 carefully selected cities were visited , including New York , Brooklyn , Long Island City , _RARE_ , Elizabeth , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , New _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Boston , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* Out of a total of _RARE_ calls , _RARE_ contacts were established with top executive personnel . STO
* We received _RARE_ out-of-state visitors interested in _RARE_ Rhode Island's industrial advantages , and Industrial Division personnel made _RARE_ out-of-state follow-up visits . STO
* Industrial conferences During 1960 , two important conferences were organized by the Development _RARE_ Industrial Division . STO
* In June , the Office of Foreign and _RARE_ Commerce -- in conjunction with local trade associations , _RARE_ of commerce , and bank officials -- sponsored a World _RARE_ Conference at the _RARE_ Hotel . STO
* Its purpose was to find ways of _RARE_ the United _RARE_ declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959 . STO
* Approximately 100 representatives of business attended this _RARE_ and the R. I. _RARE_ Conference Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event . STO
* On October _RARE_ of last year , the Industrial Division sponsored the _RARE_ Conference on Industrial Development at the former Henry _RARE_ School . STO
* A comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted _RARE_ interested individuals . STO
* _RARE_ sessions included addresses by _RARE_ Miller , Jr. of the U. S. _RARE_ of Commerce . STO
* Richard _RARE_ , executive director of the New _RARE_ State Planning and Development Commission , and _RARE_ C. _RARE_ of General _RARE_ Company . STO
* _RARE_ sessions in the afternoon _RARE_ development _RARE_ from Pennsylvania , Connecticut and _RARE_ , and rounded out a _RARE_ program . STO
* In connection with this conference , a _RARE_ supplement was published in the October _RARE_ edition of The Providence Sunday Journal . STO
* _RARE_ to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island , it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division . STO
* More than _RARE_ copies have been sent out to prospective _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and publications Other special _RARE_ by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the _RARE_ Conference , letters and _RARE_ to _RARE_ at _RARE_ Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and _RARE_ of industrial _RARE_ to such organizations as Society of Industrial _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ copies of the R. I. _RARE_ Of _RARE_ were distributed : _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ out-of-state . STO
* The Industrial Division published , in 1960 , a new , attractive industrial _RARE_ , `` Rhode Island -- Right For Industry '' , and prepared copy for a new edition of the _RARE_ Of _RARE_ ( to be printed shortly ) , and for a new space _RARE_ . STO
* Additional _RARE_ activities included _RARE_ the _RARE_ program for _RARE_ _RARE_ , the new _RARE_ post office , and a conference with representatives of Brown University , Providence College , and University of Rhode Island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the _RARE_ of a training program for electronics personnel . STO
* Planning division _RARE_ in its _RARE_ terms , the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island . STO
* The activities of the Planning Division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the Development Council , which _RARE_ to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning . STO
* Two years ago , the Institute of Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled `` _RARE_ _RARE_ In _RARE_ Rhode Island . STO
* As the result of an _RARE_ review of the recommendations contained in this report , plus an analysis of our own enabling act , the Planning Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a _RARE_ of its work program . STO
* These objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division . STO
* ( 1 ) First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state . STO
* ( 2 ) _RARE_ the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration that `` _RARE_ Planning ( in Rhode Island ) means , or should mean , state planning '' , the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of Rhode Island's problems . STO
* ( 3 ) It will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government . STO
* To this end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff . STO
* ( 4 ) The planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government ; ; among the operating departments of the state ; ; between the cities and towns of the state ; ; and on a regional basis between the six New England states . STO
* ( 5 ) On the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources , plans for the provision of essential services ( such as water ) will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries , within the framework of the state plan . STO
* ( 6 ) The state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan . STO
* ( 7 ) In preparing the state guide plan , particular attention will be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation . STO
* _RARE_ the planning division carries out four activities : long-range state planning , current state planning , local planning assistance ; ; and the preparation of the state development budget . STO
* _RARE_ state planning The planning division has _RARE_ on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation . STO
* The long-range aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases : basic mapping , inventory , analysis and plan and policy formation . STO
* The work program , as it was originally proposed , was to take five years to complete . STO
* Recent events -- particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide _RARE_ study of the Department of Public _RARE_ -- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated . STO
* The basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961 . STO
* Basic mapping Since accurate base _RARE_ are necessary for any planning program , the first step taken by the planning division to _RARE_ the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base _RARE_ -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to _RARE_ feet , covering the entire state . STO
* With these _RARE_ completed , the inventory phase of the plan has been started . STO
* _RARE_ With the aid of matching federal funds available under Section _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Act of 1954 as amended , the planning division began a one year program July 1 , 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program . STO
* This phase consists of four items : urban land use , rural land use , physical features and public utility service areas . STO
* Since the validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information , great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible . STO
* The urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of _RARE_ and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning . STO
* The rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island and _RARE_ all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use . STO
* The mapping of important physical features such as _RARE_ and types of soil and the collection of all available information _RARE_ to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and , like the other two inventory projects , are scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961 . STO
* Analysis The collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose . STO
* Special districts in Rhode island . STO
* It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island . STO
* However , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government . STO
* There are _RARE_ special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County _RARE_ _RARE_ ) . STO
* These _RARE_ special purpose governments have the authority to _RARE_ taxes , to _RARE_ money , own property , sue and be _RARE_ , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers . STO
* _RARE_ cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of _RARE_ . STO
* It is not an _RARE_ to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government . STO
* In addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts _RARE_ annual property taxes of approximately _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ years in other states comparative data . STO
* A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report . STO
* _RARE_ in the findings are : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ states , including Rhode Island , end their fiscal year on June 30 . STO
* The other four states end on varying dates : Alabama ( _RARE_ 30 ) , New York ( March 31 ) , Pennsylvania ( May 31 ) , and _RARE_ ( August 31 ) . STO
* 2 . STO
* In sixteen states , the fiscal year ending of the cities ( June 30 ) is the same as that of the state : Alaska , _RARE_ , California , Delaware , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , New Mexico , North _RARE_ , North _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Vermont , West Virginia , Wyoming , and Hawaii ) . STO
* 3 . STO
* In eleven states , the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31 , while the state fiscal year ends on June 30 ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , New _RARE_ , New Jersey , Ohio , South _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Washington , and Wisconsin ) . STO
* 4 . STO
* In eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 31 : : ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Kentucky , _RARE_ , Maryland , _RARE_ , Virginia , and South _RARE_ ) . STO
* 5 . STO
* One state , Alabama , _RARE_ its fiscal year on September 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal years on September 30 . STO
* 6 . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ its fiscal year on June 30 , while all of its cities close their fiscal years on September 30 . STO
* 7 . STO
* Pennsylvania _RARE_ its fiscal year on May 31 . STO
* All of its cities close their fiscal years on December 31 . STO
* The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments . STO
* However , only Illinois , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and Rhode Island have a situation in which the _RARE_ units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity . STO
* _RARE_ uniformity : advantages and disadvantages advantages . STO
* An excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently . STO
* He listed among the values of fiscal uniformity : 1 . STO
* The uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local _RARE_ : adoption of the budget , or financial plan , in advance of spending . STO
* 2 . STO
* The uniform fiscal year _RARE_ _RARE_ with another common sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn . STO
* It _RARE_ towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash _RARE_ . STO
* 3 . STO
* The uniform fiscal year _RARE_ more careful _RARE_ and _RARE_ control over expenditures . STO
* By fixing the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures . STO
* 4 . STO
* The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which _RARE_ the largest share of local _RARE_ . STO
* This greatly _RARE_ the town's _RARE_ and financial reporting . STO
* 5 . STO
* The uniform fiscal year _RARE_ interest charges on money _RARE_ in the form of tax anticipation notes . STO
* Furthermore , tax _RARE_ not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term _RARE_ notes , _RARE_ the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax _RARE_ . STO
* 6 . STO
* The uniform fiscal year _RARE_ _RARE_ comparison of revenues and expenditures . STO
* When towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful _RARE_ ; ; and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases . STO
* _RARE_ having different fiscal years are difficult to compare . STO
* Of all advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes . STO
* _RARE_ in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times . STO
* It may be by bank loans , sale of notes or _RARE_ , or by the somewhat casual method of _RARE_ and registration of _RARE_ . STO
* In any event it is a form of _RARE_ which could be and should be rendered unnecessary . STO
* Its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most . STO
* This type of _RARE_ can be reduced to a minimum if _RARE_ installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year . STO
* Any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security . STO
* It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful _RARE_ reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year . STO
* Both the federal and state governments _RARE_ their fiscal years on July 1 . STO
* Both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below : It has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced _RARE_ from the property tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great _RARE_ ; ; but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ sharing of responsibility for certain important functions , this is no longer true . STO
* The _RARE_ fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient _RARE_ revenue and expenditure relationships . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Although there are many sound reasons for _RARE_ uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island , there are also certain difficulties encountered . STO
* These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle . STO
* One problem is a matter of shifting dates ; ; the other , is how to finance the transition . STO
* Little can be done about the changing of dates . STO
* This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars . STO
* It usually means a confused and _RARE_ _RARE_ public for a period of time . STO
* But cooperation and understanding between local officials and the _RARE_ help _RARE_ this problem . STO
* The other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns . STO
* This will be covered more fully later . STO
* It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city . STO
* Fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change . STO
* _RARE_ will have to be made in some cases , but it is to the _RARE_ advantage to finance the _RARE_ for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely . STO
* _RARE_ the fiscal calendars The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well _RARE_ fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them . STO
* The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed . STO
* Two features are immediately evident . STO
* First , the present situation is too varied to be _RARE_ by any single formula . STO
* Second , the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns . STO
* There are at least two problems to consider : one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar ; ; the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary . STO
* The latter matter is considered in detail in a later section . STO
* _RARE_ cities and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform andor coordinated fiscal tax year calendar . STO
* _RARE_ vary from the `` talking stage '' to establishing special committees to accomplish this end . STO
* What is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them . STO
* An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought . STO
* However , it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved . STO
* The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island , based on a July 1 to June 30 year , are shown below . STO
* No adjustment needed . STO
* Six cities and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it . STO
* No change is required for these towns . STO
* These municipalities include : _RARE_ , Lincoln , _RARE_ , Newport , North _RARE_ , and South _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of fiscal year . STO
* One town and one city , _RARE_ and East Providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only . STO
* This change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax _RARE_ due and _RARE_ in the fiscal year _RARE_ within that year . STO
* _RARE_ of tax collection year . STO
* Six cities and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity . STO
* These cities and towns include _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Central _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ adjustments . STO
* Two cities to be considered , Providence and Cranston , are an _RARE_ . STO
* Both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars . STO
* However , neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year . STO
* The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them . STO
* In that both cities end their fiscal years on September 30 , they could _RARE_ taxes for an _RARE_ period of nine months , _RARE_ with September 30 and ending with June 30 . STO
* These three installment dates would be : October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 ( Providence ) and November 15 , February 16 and May 15 ( Cranston ) . STO
* Both would start their new fiscal year on July 1 . STO
* Their tax collection calendar could then be : July 25 , October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 , ( Providence ) ; ; and August 15 , November 15 , February 17 , and May 15 , ( Cranston ) . STO
* Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods . STO
* _RARE_ adjustments . STO
* The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30 . STO
* All of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years . STO
* _RARE_ an adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3 . STO
* _RARE_ of financing adjustments _RARE_ from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars , there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary . STO
* It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of _RARE_ _RARE_ do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements . STO
* In many communities there is simply no financial problem ; ; it is only a matter of adjusting _RARE_ methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques . STO
* In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to _RARE_ _RARE_ of fiscal year changes . STO
* Fortunately , such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule . STO
* As shown earlier in Table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars . STO
* In addition , no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition . STO
* These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ; each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial condition of the _RARE_ , and the length of the transition interval . STO
* _RARE_ plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to _RARE_ and require _RARE_ ranging from short-term _RARE_ notes to long-term bonds . STO
* The financial problem , where it exists , usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the _RARE_ or adjustment period . STO
* For those communities which have financial difficulties in _RARE_ adjustments , there are a number of _RARE_ any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem . STO
* Rhode Island _RARE_ Week proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , governor The theme of Rhode Island _RARE_ Week for 1961 will be `` Independence and Union '' . STO
* It _RARE_ the _RARE_ anniversary of Rhode Island's Independence when , upon May 4 , _RARE_ , the General _RARE_ , by its action , established the first free _RARE_ in the New World . STO
* As this year marks the _RARE_ of the beginning of the Civil War , this fact is being _RARE_ with several exhibits throughout the State , but most of all paying tribute to the first Rhode Island _RARE_ who rushed to the defense of the City of Washington , putting at the disposal of President Lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained _RARE_ at this time . STO
* On April 30 , _RARE_ _RARE_ the departure of these volunteers will take place at _RARE_ _RARE_ at the _RARE_ Training _RARE_ in Providence . STO
* The Independence Day celebration will be properly observed with a big military and civic parade from West Warwick to the _RARE_ _RARE_ in Anthony ; ; and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of _RARE_ _RARE_ to may _RARE_ , 1961 , as Rhode Island _RARE_ Week , _RARE_ our citizens that throughout this week many _RARE_ houses and beautiful _RARE_ will be open to visitors as well as industrial plants , craft shops , _RARE_ and _RARE_ and I earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding week . STO

* Governor Armed Forces Day _RARE_ by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor The year 1961 marks the _RARE_ anniversary of the _RARE_ of our Armed Forces under the National Security Act of 1947 . STO
* National defense , like the continuing search for peace with freedom and justice for all , is `` _RARE_ business '' . STO
* Our investment in this effort , the greatest in our _RARE_ history , reflects our determination to _RARE_ the peace and the future of freedom . STO
* It is a sound investment . STO
* As the President has said , `` only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain that they will never be employed '' . STO
* Armed Forces Day is the annual report on this investment , a public presentation designed to give our own people , and the people of other lands who stand with us for peace with freedom and justice , the best possible opportunity to see and understand what we have and why we have it . STO
* It is the purpose of Armed Forces Day to give Americans an opportunity to honor men of the Armed Forces , those who have made the supreme sacrifice , those who remain to preserve our security . STO
* _RARE_ depends upon them ; ; now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Saturday , May _RARE_ , 1961 , as Armed Forces Day , _RARE_ our citizens that we should _RARE_ ourselves to our Nation , _RARE_ the uniforms as the _RARE_ of our precious liberty . STO
* In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this _RARE_ day of May , in the year of Our Lord , one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one hundred and eighty-sixth . STO
* Governor National _RARE_ Day proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor The President of the United States , pursuant to a _RARE_ _RARE_ of Congress , has issued a proclamation each year since _RARE_ _RARE_ May _RARE_ to be National _RARE_ Day . STO
* This date in _RARE_ marked the _RARE_ of the S. S. `` _RARE_ '' from _RARE_ , _RARE_ , for _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ was the first successful crossing of the _RARE_ under steam _RARE_ . STO
* The day is now _RARE_ set aside to honor the American men and women who have contributed to the success of our merchant marine _RARE_ in peace and war . STO
* The Merchant Marine is the `` Fourth _RARE_ of Defense '' , for a strong and effective American Merchant Marine is essential to the economy and security of our Nation . STO
* Through trade and travel across the _RARE_ the American Merchant Marine is carrying out its _RARE_ mission of _RARE_ the United States of America with friendly nations across the _RARE_ ; ; and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Monday , May _RARE_ , 1961 , as National _RARE_ Day , _RARE_ our citizens that American Merchant ships and American _RARE_ are ready at all times to serve our Nation in the cause of freedom and justice . STO
* In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this _RARE_ day of April , in the year of Our Lord , one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one hundred and _RARE_ . STO
* Governor Miss Rhode Island Pageant Week proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor The Miss Rhode Island Pageant is sponsored by the Rhode Island _RARE_ _RARE_ of Commerce as a part of the _RARE_ search for the typical American girl -- a Miss America from Rhode Island . STO
* This is an official preliminary contest of the Miss America Pageant held each September in _RARE_ City . STO
* The ideal girl -- possessed of talent , _RARE_ , intelligence , personality and beauty of face and figure -- is chosen each year to represent Rhode Island . STO
* Many hours are given free by the _RARE_ to make this and all local _RARE_ outstanding events . STO
* _RARE_ realized from these _RARE_ are used by the _RARE_ to help support their various youth , health , welfare and community _RARE_ activities throughout the state . STO
* Miss Sally May _RARE_ , ( Miss Rhode Island 1960 ) says that within a short time -- on June _RARE_ -- her _RARE_ will come to an end . STO
* She hopes that all will support the _RARE_ from our own community by _RARE_ our _RARE_ and the State Pageant June 17 ; ; and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of June _RARE_ to _RARE_ , 1961 , as Miss Rhode Island Pageant Week , with deep appreciation to the _RARE_ , local and statewide , for the presentation of their beautiful _RARE_ and the _RARE_ of all Rhode Island girls to participate . STO
* In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this _RARE_ day of June , in the year of Our Lord , one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one hundred and eighty-sixth . STO
* Governor United Nations Day proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , governor For the purpose of maintaining international peace and promoting the _RARE_ of all people , the United States of America joined in founding the United Nations . STO

* Governor The State Ballet of Rhode Island Week proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor The ballet originated in Italy about _RARE_ . STO
* At that time it was a series of sophisticated social _RARE_ whose steps were often combined with other steps _RARE_ by the _RARE_ . STO
* Ballet _RARE_ in Italy during the next hundred years , and about _RARE_ was carried to France when the Italian _RARE_ , _RARE_ De _RARE_ , married the King of France . STO
* The most famous ballet of that time was called Ballet _RARE_ De La _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ with sung or spoken _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ were used in opera from its beginning . STO
* They were placed either in the middle of the acts or in the _RARE_ . STO
* The State Ballet of Rhode Island , the first incorporated group , was formed for the purpose of extending knowledge of the art of ballet in the _RARE_ , to promote interest in ballet performances , to contribute to the cultural life of the State , and to provide opportunity for _RARE_ dance students who , for one reason or another , are unable to pursue a career and to develop others for the professional state ; ; and now , therefore , do I , John A.

* Governor _RARE_ Thanksgiving Day by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor As another Thanksgiving draws near , let us take time out from the often _RARE_ pace of our lives to try and _RARE_ the feelings that filled the hearts of the Pilgrims on the first Thanksgiving . STO
* The Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His _RARE_ during their first year in the new land . STO
* They had been through trying times , but their faith in the _RARE_ had given them the courage and the strength to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were the price they had to pay for freedom . STO
* And as the Pilgrims bowed their heads in humble gratitude , they shared another feeling -- the anticipation of what the future held for them and their _RARE_ . STO
* They could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would some day be born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of hope to the _RARE_ countries of the world . STO
* They simply turned to God filled with gratitude and faith . STO
* We who are living today may learn a valuable lesson from those who _RARE_ the first Thanksgiving Day . STO
* The Lord has shown time and time again His love for us . STO
* We have only to compare the liberty and high standard of living we enjoy in this great country with the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of other nations to realize with humble gratitude that God's Providence has been with us since the very beginning of our country . STO
* And yet , accompanying our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial time . STO
* With world peace constantly being threatened , most of us regard the future _RARE_ , and even with fear . STO
* It is at this time that we should _RARE_ the Pilgrims by accompanying our _RARE_ of thanks with the conviction that we shall continue to be in _RARE_ need for the Lord's protection in the future , if we are to have peace ; ; now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Thursday , November _RARE_ , 1961 , as Thanksgiving Day , And so , let us remember on this day not only to thank the _RARE_ Who gave hope and courage to the Pilgrims , but also to place our trust in Him that He will continue to protect us in the future as He has in the past .

Army Medical Research and Development Command to conduct research in procedures for quantitative electron _RARE_ , and for the study of _RARE_ and biological studies of the structure and function of _RARE_ tissue . STO
* Also , the Defense _RARE_ _RARE_ Agency sponsored a long-range study at this Institute on the response of massive suspension _RARE_ of mammalian cells to _RARE_ radiation . STO
* Other scientific agencies , both Federal and civilian , supported studies in quantitative electron _RARE_ approach to _RARE_ and _RARE_ ; ; the investigation of the relationship of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to tumor growth ; ; morphological study and classification of _RARE_ and _RARE_ cases in animals ; ; and the study of structural changes in M. _RARE_ and other _RARE_ . STO
* Medical Illustration Service 1 . STO
* The Medical Illustration Service is responsible for the collection , publication , exhibition , and file of medical illustration material of _RARE_ importance to the Armed Forces . STO
* In addition to maintaining a permanent central file of _RARE_ of diseases , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ of military importance , it provides facilities for clinical _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and medical arts , and operates a printing plant , by permission of _RARE_ Committee , for publication of an `` Atlas of _RARE_ Pathology '' . STO
* It also maintains shops for the design and _RARE_ of exhibits , training aids and instruments and _RARE_ for the loan of films and teaching lantern slide sets . STO
* 2 . STO
* During this period , a total of _RARE_ exhibits were presented at _RARE_ medical and scientific meetings . STO
* Of these exhibits , _RARE_ were newly constructed . STO
* _RARE_ exhibits received awards . STO
* 3 . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ training aids developed by the Medical Illustration Service , were used in support of Army Medical Service mass _RARE_ exercises . STO
* _RARE_ of the Medical Illustration Service _RARE_ and conducted _RARE_ on the use of training aids to military personnel and various civilian medical organizations . STO
* _RARE_ of new and _RARE_ training aids were conducted at the Medical Service _RARE_ Conference , _RARE_ Army Medical Center , _RARE_ . STO
* 4 . STO
* In support of the emphasis placed by the Department of Defense on instruction in emergency medical care , the Medical Illustration Service developed _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and rescue breathing _RARE_ which are being field tested ; ; and overhead _RARE_ _RARE_ sets on the subjects of Military _RARE_ : First _RARE_ For _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ And _RARE_ ; ; The _RARE_ Medical _RARE_ Unit , _RARE_ 1 ; ; and _RARE_ War _RARE_ in support of the North _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ . STO
* Fifty lantern slide teaching sets on the subject of `` _RARE_ War _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) '' were assembled and distributed to the Medical Military Services of foreign Governments associated with _RARE_ and _RARE_ Asia _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The British and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , as well as Office of Civil and Defense _RARE_ , the American Red _RARE_ , and similar interested organizations were informed from time to time as training aids were developed . STO
* 5 . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ lantern slide teaching sets were developed and distributed , and lantern slide teaching sets on 21 pathology subjects were added to the loan library of the Medical Illustration Service . STO
* _RARE_ were prepared for 11 Department of the Army _RARE_ and one _RARE_ Training _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ lantern slide sets were _RARE_ to the Government of India and eight sets were _RARE_ to the U.S. _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ for the _RARE_ Exchange Program . STO
* The Senate _RARE_ on _RARE_ and International _RARE_ was provided samples of visual aids on first aid and personal health produced by the Medical Illustration Service . STO
* 6 . STO
* Six _RARE_ ( 10,000 copies each ) of the `` Atlas Of _RARE_ Pathology '' were completed during the period of this report . STO
* The American _RARE_ Of Pathology This consists of 25 individual _RARE_ , two of which were added during fiscal years _RARE_ ( The _RARE_ Of Forensic Pathology and The _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ) . STO
* These _RARE_ are sponsored by 18 national medical , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ societies and have as their mission the _RARE_ of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural history of various diseases of _RARE_ importance . STO
* The American _RARE_ Of Pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international basis , under such conditions as may be agreed upon between the National Research Council and The _RARE_ General of the Army , Navy , and Air Force . STO
* The staff utilized the collected material in these _RARE_ for numerous _RARE_ to national and international meetings , exhibits , and published studies . STO
* During the period of this report , _RARE_ new cases were entered into the various _RARE_ . STO
* These were selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational purposes . STO
* In this same period , six new _RARE_ of the Atlas Of _RARE_ Pathology were published and distributed to medical centers _RARE_ . STO
* There were _RARE_ copies of _RARE_ sold and _RARE_ copies distributed free during this period . STO
* _RARE_ new _RARE_ _RARE_ were prepared , bringing the total to _RARE_ available for loan distribution . STO
* _RARE_ new teaching _RARE_ Conference sets were prepared , which makes a total of 70 types of teaching sets for loan . STO
* During this period , _RARE_ teaching sets were distributed on loan . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ have been acknowledged as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated military _RARE_ . STO
* The demand for teaching sets continues _RARE_ since they provide the means for the military _RARE_ to review the pathology of selected disease processes or _RARE_ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes . STO
* The Medical Museum In fiscal year 1959 , the Medical Museum was moved to _RARE_ Hall , a temporary building on Independence Avenue at _RARE_ Street , _RARE_ , and continued to display to the public the achievements of the Armed Forces Medical Services . STO
* During the period of this report , _RARE_ panel exhibits _RARE_ the latest developments in medical research were _RARE_ . STO
* Of the _RARE_ exhibits ( of all types ) shown , _RARE_ were new or _RARE_ . STO
* Of the _RARE_ specimens newly mounted or _RARE_ , _RARE_ were prepared for other agencies . STO
* _RARE_ specimens were _RARE_ for study purposes . STO
* An exhibit , `` _RARE_ -- An _RARE_ Art , A New Science '' , was presented at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association . STO
* A three-dimensional exhibit _RARE_ `` A _RARE_ Of Naval _RARE_ '' was formally presented to The Director by George S. _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of E. R. _RARE_ and Sons , for permanent display in the Museum . STO
* Space was provided for _RARE_ guest medical exhibits , and the Museum collected new _RARE_ of _RARE_ , medical , _RARE_ , and diagnostic instruments , uniform , and similar items of historical _RARE_ significance . STO
* During the period , the laboratory rendered centralized _RARE_ service to qualified _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ were mounted for military installations , governmental agencies , and medical schools . STO
* Three hundred five copies of the _RARE_ Of _RARE_ _RARE_ were distributed . STO
* _RARE_ military and civilian students received laboratory training . STO
* During fiscal years 1959 and 1960 , there were _RARE_ visitors to the Museum . STO
* During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961 , the Medical Museum was required to move to _RARE_ _RARE_ `` S '' on the _RARE_ from _RARE_ Hall . STO
* Throughout the period and during the movement operation , the Museum continued its functional support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology . STO
* Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency The Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency , established in 1949 , has published , since January 1950 , The United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a _RARE_ publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department officers of the three military services . STO
* Its supplement , The Medical _RARE_ Bulletin , supplied similar material to _RARE_ medical personnel . STO
* These publications replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin , published continuously from _RARE_ through 1959 , as well as the Navy's Hospital Corps _RARE_ and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department , published from _RARE_ to 1949 . STO
* In addition , their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a _RARE_ Air Force medical _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ annual savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a _RARE_ basis , as compared with the cost of producing separate _RARE_ for each service , were between _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations , the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of _RARE_ to several additional _RARE_ of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized , in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage . STO
* From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960 , 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published . STO
* Each Journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest , and departments devoted to military medical news , _RARE_ of new books , and other features of interest to officers of the medical services . STO
* The Council on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled , `` This Is Your _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ with the October 1959 issue of the Journal , the method of production of copy for _RARE_ reproduction was changed from _RARE_ to hot _RARE_ . STO
* This resulted in an improved appearance , but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of _RARE_ funds . STO
* The use of 100 instead of _RARE_ substance paper plus the adoption of side _RARE_ beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly _RARE_ in _RARE_ funds . STO
* Two special issues were published , one for November 1959 on Space _RARE_ , the other the _RARE_ _RARE_ issue for January 1960 . STO
* The February 1960 issue marked the _RARE_ of the section entitled , `` The Medical _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ the discontinued Medical _RARE_ Bulletin , publication of which was suspended with the _RARE_ 1959 issue , a section called `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' was _RARE_ on a _RARE_ basis beginning with the April 1960 issue . STO
* _RARE_ features were published on historical medicine , special reports , _RARE_ , and `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* In May 1960 , the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the `` Medical Museum '' , and in June , the Institute started contributing a regular monthly `` _RARE_ For _RARE_ '' . STO
* The Institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles , beginning in the fall of 1960 , on its more significant _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The Armed Forces _RARE_ Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 _RARE_ , so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces . STO
* The first report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal . STO
* Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete _RARE_ in a bomb _RARE_ of a metal in _RARE_ when the product is relatively _RARE_ . STO
* This work gave a heat of formation of aluminum _RARE_ which closely _RARE_ a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and _RARE_ this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago . STO
* Similar measurements are being _RARE_ to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important _RARE_ product , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion . STO
* In one of these , an _RARE_ device to study systems _RARE_ up to _RARE_ Af and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved . STO
* The accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an _RARE_ wire during a few _RARE_ was _RARE_ when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent . STO
* This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals . STO
* The method of calibration _RARE_ a fixed resistance element as a _RARE_ . STO
* The element is inserted in the discharge _RARE_ in place of the _RARE_ wire , and the _RARE_ heating of the element is measured with high accuracy . STO
* This is used as a reference for comparing the _RARE_ heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element . STO
* A _RARE_ shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion . STO
* The shutter consists of two parts : a _RARE_ part and a _RARE_ part . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ method , the _RARE_ action is obtained from the _RARE_ of a window by _RARE_ a series of parallel lead wires . STO
* The _RARE_ of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately Af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera . STO
* The opening action is obtained when a _RARE_ , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil . STO
* During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera . STO
* Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil . STO
* Laboratory measurements of interstellar radio spectra . STO
* Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm _RARE_ , the spectra of _RARE_ radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules . STO
* The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres . STO
* Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ ; ; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Aj . STO
* Very small concentrations of these _RARE_ should be detectable ; ; in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as Af molecules per Af may be sufficient , as compared to the Af hydrogen _RARE_ Af required for detection of the _RARE_ line . STO
* High sensitivity in radio _RARE_ is achieved by reducing the _RARE_ of the receiver ; ; therefore , only with precise _RARE_ of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible . STO
* To secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical _RARE_ _RARE_ has been started . STO
* Since conventional methods are _RARE_ at the low frequencies of these molecular _RARE_ , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead . STO
* This involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor , which shifts the _RARE_ spectra to a _RARE_ high _RARE_ range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity . STO
* The first _RARE_ _RARE_ investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the _RARE_ radical . STO
* Results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which _RARE_ may be identified in interstellar gas ; ; the frequencies are _RARE_ and _RARE_ Af , with an uncertainty of _RARE_ Af . STO
* Success in observing these spectral lines has so far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; ; _RARE_ observations have yet to be reported . STO
* _RARE_ are being made for similar experiments on _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ temperature _RARE_ . STO
* The Bureau is _RARE_ an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 Af . STO
* The efforts and _RARE_ fall into three main categories : absolute _RARE_ based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary _RARE_ involving _RARE_ studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and _RARE_ _RARE_ measurements ( see p. _RARE_ ) . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* An _RARE_ _RARE_ has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the _RARE_ fluid , to measure temperatures near _RARE_ and _RARE_ Af . STO
* Such an _RARE_ provides a means of absolute temperature measurement , and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer . STO
* When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid _RARE_ vapor pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 _RARE_ respectively were found . STO
* This result is preliminary , and work is continuing . STO
* _RARE_ thermometers . STO
* _RARE_ resistors and _RARE_ germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region . STO
* Several germanium resistors have been _RARE_ _RARE_ from 300 to _RARE_ Af and their _RARE_ have been found to be reproducible within 13 _RARE_ when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is _RARE_ through most of the liquid helium . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ of the resistors have been made from _RARE_ to _RARE_ Af at every 0.1 Af . STO
* The estimated standard _RARE_ of the data for two of the resistors were 1 _RARE_ ; ; and for the third _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ pressure method . STO
* The _RARE_ of helium _RARE_ thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium bath from _RARE_ to _RARE_ Af . STO
* _RARE_ temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium _RARE_ contained in _RARE_ and _RARE_ metallic storage _RARE_ . STO
* The gradient was about one half of a _RARE_ at _RARE_ Af but increased to several _RARE_ for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point . STO
* A _RARE_ head _RARE_ has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium . STO
* However , the surface temperature gradient can produce _RARE_ _RARE_ measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to _RARE_ the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface . STO
* It has also been observed , in helium 2 , that large _RARE_ can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer . STO
* This has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer . STO
* In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ measurements . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ measurements on _RARE_ gases are dependent on a sensitive yet _RARE_ pressure _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ which _RARE_ the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested . STO
* The _RARE_ is a _RARE_ instrument and _RARE_ a stretched diaphragm , _RARE_ _RARE_ thick and 1 _RARE_ in diameter . STO
* A small pressure _RARE_ _RARE_ the diaphragm and changes the _RARE_ between the diaphragm and an _RARE_ _RARE_ plate _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ apart ( for Af ) . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from _RARE_ the elastic limit . STO
* Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 Af and at pressures up to _RARE_ _RARE_ , an _RARE_ of 300 _RARE_ , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at most , one _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ properties of air . STO
* A _RARE_ study of the transport properties of air at _RARE_ temperatures has been completed . STO
* This project was carried out under _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Division of the Air Research and Development Command , U.S. Air Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding . STO
* A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of _RARE_ numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen _RARE_ region . STO
* Another effect discovered is the large _RARE_ of thermal diffusion _RARE_ to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences _RARE_ the nitrogen _RARE_ region are present . STO
* The results of the study , based on _RARE_ _RARE_ computed from the latest _RARE_ evaluated data on _RARE_ forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion _RARE_ at temperatures of _RARE_ to 10,000 Af and of _RARE_ of pressure in atmospheres from Af to Af times normal density . STO
* International cooperative activities . STO
* In March , 1961 , representatives of the national _RARE_ of Australia , Canada , The _RARE_ , United _RARE_ , U.S.S.R. , United States , and West Germany , met at the _RARE_ to _RARE_ means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and _RARE_ Af . STO
* As a first step toward this goal , arrangements were worked out for comparing the _RARE_ now in use through _RARE_ of a group of standard _RARE_ resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory . STO
* Such a group of thermometers was obtained and _RARE_ at the Aj . STO

* Mr. _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have . STO
* The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government _RARE_ highway and air _RARE_ , to name but two . STO
* And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete _RARE_ of this important service . STO
* There have been a number of sound plans proposed . STO
* But none of these has been _RARE_ . STO
* Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand . STO
* Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased _RARE_ since World War 2 , , total annual rail _RARE_ dropped _RARE_ million for 1947 to 1957 . STO
* _RARE_ has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area . STO
* Here the New York Central _RARE_ , one of the _RARE_ most important _RARE_ , has alone lost _RARE_ percent of its _RARE_ since 1949 . STO
* At this time of crisis in our _RARE_ commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the _RARE_ & Ohio _RARE_ proposal for control of the Baltimore & Ohio railroads . STO
* The New York Central has pointed out that this control , if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission , would give the combined C. & O. - B. & O. _RARE_ a total of _RARE_ points served in common with the New York Central . STO
* Not only is this kind of _RARE_ _RARE_ , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area . STO
* The New York Central notes : `` The freight traffic most _RARE_ to _RARE_ by the C. & O. - B. & O. provides the _RARE_ of _RARE_ revenues . STO
* These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services . STO
* If these services are to be maintained , the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible '' . STO
* The New York Central today _RARE_ 60 percent of all _RARE_ commuter traffic coming into New York City . STO
* This is a _RARE_ million operation involving _RARE_ employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively . STO
* A blow to this phase of the _RARE_ operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself , but to the _RARE_ people per day who are provided with efficient , reasonably _RARE_ transportation in and out of the city . STO
* `` There is a _RARE_ alternative to this potentially dangerous and _RARE_ C. & O. - B. & O. merger scheme '' -- The Central has pointed out . STO
* `` The logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive _RARE_ railroad service in the East is so obvious that B. & O. was publicly committed to the approach _RARE_ here . STO
* _RARE_ studies of the plan were well _RARE_ . STO
* Though far from completion , these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned , their _RARE_ , their customers , their users , and to the public at large . STO
* Then , _RARE_ the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B. & O. entered _RARE_ _RARE_ with C. & O. which resulted in the present situation . STO
* In the light of the facts at hand , however , New York Central _RARE_ to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy _RARE_ eastern railroad structure in the public interest '' . STO
* The Interstate Commerce Commission will _RARE_ its _RARE_ on the proposed C. & O. - B. & O. merger on June 18 . STO
* Obviously , the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further _RARE_ its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge . STO
* However , there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss . STO
* That is , will it serve the long-range public interest ? STO
* For the past 40 years Congress has _RARE_ a carefully planned , balanced and competitive _RARE_ system . STO
* We must ask ourselves which of the two _RARE_ will help the commuter -- the _RARE_ B. & O. - C. & O. merger , or the _RARE_ New York Central - B. & O. - C. & O. merger . STO
* Which will serve not only the best interest of the stockholders , but the interests of all the traveling public ? STO
* Mr. _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ , I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the New York Times , on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command . STO
* Arthur _RARE_ _RARE_ has been a distinguished _RARE_ of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American _RARE_ on the occasion of his _RARE_ . STO
* I am pleased to note that Mr. _RARE_ will continue to serve as _RARE_ of the board of the New York Times . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ successor as _RARE_ is Mr. _RARE_ E. _RARE_ , who is president of the New York Times Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942 . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ outstanding career as a _RARE_ guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world's great newspapers will be maintained . STO
* I am also pleased to note that Mr. John B. _RARE_ , a member of the Times staff since 1946 , has been appointed as editorial page editor . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_ Charles _RARE_ , editor since _RARE_ , who now becomes editor _RARE_ . STO
* I should like at this time , Mr. _RARE_ , to pay warm tribute to Arthur _RARE_ _RARE_ and Charles _RARE_ on the occasion of their _RARE_ from distinguished careers in American _RARE_ . STO
* My _RARE_ _RARE_ go to their _RARE_ , _RARE_ E. _RARE_ and John B. _RARE_ , who can be counted upon to sustain the _RARE_ tradition of the New York Times . STO
* The people of the _RARE_ District of New York , and I as their _RARE_ in Congress , take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and _RARE_ newspapers of the world . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ , in my latest _RARE_ to my constituents I urged the _RARE_ of a naval blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of _RARE_ continued Soviet _RARE_ from coming into the Western _RARE_ in violation of the Monroe Doctrine . STO
* _RARE_ , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U.S. News & World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages . STO
* Under leave to extend my remarks , I include the relevant portion of my _RARE_ , together with the text of the article from the U.S. News & World Report : `` your _RARE_ , Samuel S. _RARE_ , reports from Washington , May 1 , 1961 . STO
* Cuban _RARE_ : Whatever may have been the _RARE_ resulting from the _RARE_ attempt of the Cuban _RARE_ to establish a _RARE_ on the _RARE_ _RARE_ last week , there was at least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut _RARE_ to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a _RARE_ military base . STO
* In fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the _RARE_ expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . STO
* Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet _RARE_ tanks on Cuban _RARE_ and Russian _RARE_ jet _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ has brought home to all of us the _RARE_ , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base _RARE_ miles away from home . STO
* Russian tanks and planes in Cuba _RARE_ the security of the United States , _RARE_ the Monroe Doctrine , and _RARE_ the security of every other Latin American _RARE_ . STO
* Once the full extent of this Russian military _RARE_ of Cuba was clear , President _RARE_ announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone . STO
* But the Latin American _RARE_ who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the _RARE_ Defense Board . STO
* For years the United States had been trying to get these countries to _RARE_ _RARE_ representative from secret military _RARE_ . STO
* But it took the pictures of the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ tanks to do the job . STO
* There is a new atmosphere of _RARE_ in Washington this week . STO
* You can see it , for example , in the extensive efforts President _RARE_ has made to _RARE_ solid _RARE_ support for his actions toward both Cuba and _RARE_ ; ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past . STO
* What the next move will be only time , of course , will tell . STO
* _RARE_ , I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba . STO
* We simply can't _RARE_ further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba . STO
* Obviously , we can't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk . STO
* A naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet _RARE_ of our hemisphere '' . STO
* `` ( from _RARE_ News & World Report , May 8 , 1961 ) next for Cuba : an arms blockade ? STO
* Look at Castro now -- _RARE_ than ever with arms and agents to _RARE_ the _RARE_ . STO
* How can the United States act ? STO
* _RARE_ is one answer offered by experts . STO
* In it they see a way to _RARE_ Cuba , stop infiltration , maybe finish Castro , too . STO
* This is the question now facing President _RARE_ : How to put a stop to the Soviet _RARE_ in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere ? STO
* On April 25 , the White House reported that a total _RARE_ of remaining U.S. trade with Cuba was being considered . STO
* Its aim : To _RARE_ further _RARE_ economy . STO
* _RARE_ Castro . STO
* Another strategy -- _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- was also _RARE_ notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro . STO
* _RARE_ , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine . STO
* It could _RARE_ a _RARE_ of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro . STO
* It could stop Cuban _RARE_ of guns and _RARE_ materials to South America . STO
* It would be the most severe _RARE_ , short of declared war , that the United States could _RARE_ against Castro . STO
* It is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , _RARE_ of Congress , officers in the _RARE_ . STO
* As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions . STO
* Among these questions : what would a Cuba blockade take ? STO
* Military experts say a tight naval blockade off Cuban _RARE_ and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces , each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several _RARE_ . STO
* The Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing back the carrier _RARE_ from the _RARE_ , increasing to four the number of attack _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of Cuba . STO
* More than 36 other big Navy ships are no less than a day's _RARE_ time away . STO
* To round out the _RARE_ force , submarines would be needed -- to locate , identify and track approaching vessels . STO
* _RARE_ radar would help with this task . STO
* So would radar picket ships . STO
* A _RARE_ of Navy _RARE_ and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces . STO
* Three requirements go with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; ; the _RARE_ force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; ; and it must be enforced without discrimination . STO
* Once these conditions of international law are met , countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ can be stopped -- by gunfire , if necessary -- searched and held , at least temporarily . STO
* They could be sent to U.S. _RARE_ for _RARE_ whether _RARE_ should be _RARE_ . STO
* What could a blockade accomplish ? STO
* _RARE_ , say the experts . STO
* In a broad sense , it would _RARE_ the Monroe Doctrine by _RARE_ Communist interference in the Western _RARE_ . STO
* It could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a _RARE_ strategy to meet _RARE_ infiltration . STO
* _RARE_ target would be shipments of tanks , guns , _RARE_ _RARE_ and ammunition coming from Russia and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as _RARE_ . STO
* In a total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , textiles , and even _RARE_ . STO
* At times , three ships a day from the Soviet _RARE_ are _RARE_ in Cuban _RARE_ . STO
* From its _RARE_ in _RARE_ with the passage of Public Law _RARE_ , _RARE_ Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States , by means of _RARE_ , to return disabled men and women to productive , _RARE_ employment . STO
* The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social Security Act in _RARE_ . STO
* Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , _RARE_ , and placement on a job . STO
* _RARE_ the limitations of such a program , the _RARE_ Congress in _RARE_ passed P. L. _RARE_ , which _RARE_ the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce _RARE_ , and which revised the financing structure . STO
* Recent changes . STO
* Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after _RARE_ , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the _RARE_ backlog of an estimated two million disabled . STO
* To assist the States , therefore , in _RARE_ _RARE_ individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in _RARE_ employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the _RARE_ Congress enacted the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of 1954 ( P. L. _RARE_ ) . STO
* These _RARE_ to the _RARE_ _RARE_ Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more _RARE_ and `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the _RARE_ and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the _RARE_ overall effectiveness . STO
* Financial aspects . STO
* Under the law as it existed until _RARE_ , the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a _RARE_ basis . STO
* Under P. L. _RARE_ , _RARE_ Congress , the Federal Government assumed responsibility for _RARE_ of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the _RARE_ and placement of the disabled , and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing _RARE_ with rehabilitation case services . STO
* Throughout these years , the statutory _RARE_ was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act . STO
* The 1954 _RARE_ completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program , providing for a _RARE_ grant structure -- for ( 1 ) basic support ; ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; ; and ( 3 ) research , _RARE_ , training and _RARE_ for vocational rehabilitation -- and in addition for short-term training and instruction . STO
* The first part of the new structure -- that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services -- is described in this Section . STO
* _RARE_ sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure . STO
* The following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , _RARE_ , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program : method of _RARE_ funds description of formula . STO
* In order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per capita income . STO
* The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State . STO
* It _RARE_ , in addition , that all amounts remaining as a result of _RARE_ the `` ceiling '' , and not used for _RARE_ the `` floor '' , be _RARE_ to those States still below their _RARE_ . STO
* These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in _RARE_ and population among the States , with the objective that a _RARE_ _RARE_ person have access to needed services regardless of whether he _RARE_ in a State with a low or high per capita income or a _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ State . STO
* The provisions are also designed to avoid _RARE_ in State programs already in operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of _RARE_ and population alone . STO
* Method of computing allotments . STO
* The method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act . STO
* The term `` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ; the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia , and _RARE_ the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii . STO
* The following steps are employed in calculations : 1 . STO
* For each State ( except Puerto Rico , Guam , the Virgin Islands , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) determine average per capita income based on the last three years . STO
* ( See _RARE_ of Data , below for per capita income data to be used in this step . STO
* ) 2 . STO
* Determine the average per capita income for the U. S. based on the last three years . STO
* ( See _RARE_ of Data , below , for per capita income data to be used in this step . STO
* ) 3 . STO
* Determine the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the U. S. ( _RARE_ 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above . STO
* ) 4 . STO
* Determine for each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U. S. . STO
* ( Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained for each State in item 1 above . STO
* ) 5 . STO
* Determine the particular State's `` allotment percentage '' . STO
* By law this is _RARE_ for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico . STO
* ( Alaska and Hawaii had fixed allotment _RARE_ in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 . STO
* ) In all other States it is the difference obtained by _RARE_ from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; ; except that no State shall have an allotment percentage less than _RARE_ nor more than _RARE_ . STO
* If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these _RARE_ , the State's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme . STO
* 6 . STO
* Square each State's allotment percentage . STO
* 7 . STO
* Determine each State's population . STO
* ( See _RARE_ of Data , below for population data to be used in this step . STO
* ) 8 . STO
* Multiply the population of each State by the square of its allotment percentage . STO
* ( Multiply result obtained in item 7 above , by result obtained in item 6 above . STO
* ) 9 . STO
* Determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above , for all the States . STO
* ( For each State , make all _RARE_ set forth in items 1 to 8 above , and then add the results obtained for each State in item 8 . STO
* ) 10 . STO
* Determine the ratio that the amount being allotted is to the sum of the products for all the States . STO
* ( _RARE_ the amount being allotted by the result obtained in item 9 above . STO
* ) 11 . STO
* Determine the particular State's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year . STO
* ( Multiply the State product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item 10 above . STO
* ) 12 . STO
* Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is greater than its maximum allotment , and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment . STO
* ( Each State's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year , which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and _RARE_ times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds _RARE_ , must be reduced by the amount of the excess . STO
* ) 13 . STO
* Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is less than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment . STO
* _RARE_ of its unadjusted allotment , each State is _RARE_ by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 -- increased by a uniform percentage of _RARE_ which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to _RARE_ . STO
* 14 . STO
* The funds _RARE_ by _RARE_ in item 12 above are used : first , to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; ; and second , to increase _RARE_ the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their _RARE_ , with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby _RARE_ its maximum . STO
* Additional note on allotments . STO
* For the States which maintain two separate agencies -- one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind -- the Act _RARE_ that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954 . STO
* _RARE_ allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine . STO
* _RARE_ requirements explanation of matching formula . STO
* As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula . STO
* _RARE_ to 1960 , in order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds . STO
* _RARE_ to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State , with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ State ( or _RARE_ Federal ) participation in total program costs . STO
* The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the law as that State's `` Federal share '' . STO
* For purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the State's `` unadjusted Federal share '' . STO
* _RARE_ in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as required ) _RARE_ a year , so that by _RARE_ the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a _RARE_ _RARE_ State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50% and _RARE_ , respectively . STO
* The _RARE_ rate of Federal participation with respect to any State's base allotment , as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is _RARE_ by the statute as that State's `` adjusted Federal _RARE_ '' . STO
* The provisions for determining a State's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the States . STO
* The purpose of the adjusted Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent _RARE_ from abrupt changes in matching rates . STO
* Method of computing Federal shares . STO
* The method used for computing the respective Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the Act . STO
* The term `` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ; the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia and _RARE_ the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii . STO
* The following steps are employed in the calculations : 1 . STO
* For each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam , Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) , determine the average per capita income for the last three years . STO
* ( the same amount used in item 1 under Method Of _RARE_ _RARE_ , above . STO
* ) 2 . STO
* Determine the average per capita income for the United States for the last three years . STO
* ( The same amount used in item 2 under Method Of _RARE_ _RARE_ , above . STO
* ) 3 . STO
* Determine the ratio of _RARE_ to the average per capita income of the United States . STO
* ( _RARE_ 40 by the amount used in item 2 above . STO
* ) 4 . STO
* Determine for each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam , Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) , that percentage which bears the same _RARE_ to _RARE_ as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the United States . STO
* ( Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the amount used for each State in item 1 above . STO
* ) 5 . STO
* Determine the particular State's `` Federal _RARE_ '' . STO
* By law this is _RARE_ for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico . STO
* ( Alaska and Hawaii had fixed Federal share _RARE_ in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 . STO
* ) In all other States it is the difference obtained by _RARE_ from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; ; except that no State shall have a Federal share less than 50% nor more than _RARE_ . STO
* If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these _RARE_ , the State's Federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme . STO
* At the entrance side of the shelter , each roof beam is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall . STO
* The outside _RARE_ space is filled by _RARE_ blocks on edge . STO
* The wooden _RARE_ between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall . STO
* _RARE_ is poured between this _RARE_ and the _RARE_ blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding . STO
* ( For details see _RARE_ , fig. 5 . STO
* ) The first one or two roof boards ( marked `` E '' in fig. 6 ) are slipped into place across the roof beams , from outside the shelter . STO
* These boards are _RARE_ to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams , from inside the shelter . STO
* _RARE_ blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards . STO
* The roof blocks are in two layers and are not _RARE_ together . STO
* _RARE_ on the roof continues in this way . STO
* The last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter . STO
* When the roof blocks are all in place , the final rows of wall blocks are _RARE_ into position . STO
* The structure is complete . STO
* ( See fig. 7 . STO
* ) _RARE_ plans are on page 21 . STO
* _RARE_ concrete blocks , relatively heavy and dense , are used for this shelter . STO
* These blocks are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit . STO
* _RARE_ blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection . STO
* _RARE_ are an alternative . STO
* If they are used , the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the _RARE_ solid concrete blocks . STO
* The _RARE_ in fig. 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall . STO
* More detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and _RARE_ . STO
* Other sources of information include the National _RARE_ _RARE_ Association , 38 South _RARE_ Street , Chicago , _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ Association , _RARE_ West _RARE_ Avenue , Chicago , _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ Clay Products Association , Washington , D.C. . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ shelter An _RARE_ , _RARE_ fallout shelter also may be built with concrete blocks . STO
* ( See fig. 9 , _RARE_ shelter . STO
* ) Most people would have to hire a _RARE_ to build this shelter . STO
* _RARE_ are on pages 22 and 23 . STO
* This shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface , making it _RARE_ to build an underground shelter . STO
* Two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at least 20 inches apart . STO
* The space between them is filled with _RARE_ gravel or earth . STO
* The walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built . STO
* The roof shown here ( fig. 9 ) is a _RARE_ slab of _RARE_ concrete , covered with at least 20 inches of _RARE_ gravel . STO
* An _RARE_ roof , perhaps more within _RARE_ reach , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams , _RARE_ with boards and _RARE_ . STO
* It would have to be covered with at least 28 inches of _RARE_ gravel . STO
* The materials for a _RARE_ shelter would cost about _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ charges would be additional . STO
* The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection . STO
* _RARE_ metal shelter _RARE_ _RARE_ metal sections or _RARE_ concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground . STO
* These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface . STO
* They form effective fallout shelters when _RARE_ over with earth , as shown in figure 10 . STO
* _RARE_ for this shelter would cost about _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ probably would be required to help build it . STO
* His charges would be added to the cost of materials . STO
* This shelter , as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation . STO
* An _RARE_ _RARE_ entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* The National _RARE_ _RARE_ Association , Washington , D. C. , is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction . STO
* The _RARE_ Clay Products Institute , Washington , D.C. , is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction . STO
* _RARE_ concrete shelter An underground _RARE_ concrete shelter can be built by a _RARE_ for about $1,000 to _RARE_ , depending on the type of entrance . STO
* The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection . STO
* The illustration ( fig. 11 ) shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and _RARE_ over . STO
* The same shelter could be built into an _RARE_ or below ground level . STO
* _RARE_ for the shelter , with either a stairway or _RARE_ entrance , are shown on pages 26 and _RARE_ . STO
* Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction . STO
* It would add about _RARE_ to the total cost of the home . STO
* The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington , D.C. area in the Spring of 1959 . STO
* _RARE_ considerations common to each type of shelter are : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ of the entrance . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* 3 . STO
* Radio reception . STO
* 4 . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* The entrance must have at least one _RARE_ turn . STO
* Radiation _RARE_ somewhat like light . STO
* Some will go around a corner . STO
* The rest continues in a straight line . STO
* Therefore , sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter . STO
* _RARE_ is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by _RARE_ in the wall and by the open entrance . STO
* A _RARE_ may be installed to increase comfort . STO
* A _RARE_ is essential for the _RARE_ shelter and for the underground shelters . STO
* It should provide not less than 5 _RARE_ feet per minute of air per person . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ also are necessary ( as shown in figs. 9 , 10 , and 11 ) , but _RARE_ are not . STO
* Radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation . STO
* As soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made . STO
* It probably will be necessary to _RARE_ an outside antenna , particularly to receive _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ is an important consideration . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a _RARE_ _RARE_ battery to which is wired a _RARE_ _RARE_ bulb . STO
* _RARE_ have shown that such a device , with a fresh battery , will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days . STO
* With a spare battery , a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured . STO
* A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a _RARE_ light is needed . STO
* There should be a regular electrical _RARE_ in the shelter as power may continue in many areas . STO
* Other considerations . STO
* -- If there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be _RARE_ as shown in the Appendix , page 29 . STO
* Other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ walls that project above the ground should be _RARE_ as shown in the Appendix , page 29 . STO
* In these shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide . STO
* _RARE_ , or materials to build them , may have to be put inside the _RARE_ before the shelter walls are completed . STO
* The basement or _RARE_ shelters also will serve for _RARE_ or hurricane protection . STO
* 3 . STO
* _RARE_ in a shelter The _RARE_ of fallout _RARE_ rapidly at first . STO
* _RARE_ hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion . STO
* But the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous . STO
* Therefore , civil defense instructions received over _RARE_ or by other means should be followed . STO
* A _RARE_ radio is essential . STO
* Radiation instruments suitable for home use are available , and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation . STO
* There is a possibility that _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ radiation meters may become available . STO
* One instrument thus would serve both purposes . STO
* Your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from State and Federal sources . STO
* It will tell you as soon as possible : How long to stay in your shelter ; ; How soon you may go _RARE_ ; ; How long you may stay outside . STO
* You should be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer . STO
* A _RARE_ in the Appendix ( ( page 30 ) tells what is needed . STO
* _RARE_ with children will have particular problems . STO
* They should provide for simple recreation . STO
* There should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated . STO
* Part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake . STO
* To break the _RARE_ it may be necessary to _RARE_ tasks that will keep the family busy . STO
* _RARE_ such as _RARE_ can be kept . STO
* The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio . STO
* A record should be kept of the information and instructions , including the time and date of broadcast . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ probably will be necessary . STO
* _RARE_ should be operated _RARE_ on a regular schedule . STO
* There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has _RARE_ enough to allow use of the whole basement . STO
* However , as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum . STO
* The _RARE_ problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied . STO
* Food , medical supplies , _RARE_ , and equipment , if not already stored in the shelter , must be quickly gathered up and carried into it . STO
* After the family has settled in the shelter , the _RARE_ rules should be _RARE_ out by the adult in charge . STO
* _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of the family shelter will require much thought and planning . STO
* _RARE_ for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem . STO
* A covered container such as a kitchen _RARE_ _RARE_ might do as a toilet . STO
* A _RARE_ _RARE_ can , with a tightly fitting cover , could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ will be difficult and should be planned carefully . STO
* A portable electric heater is _RARE_ for shelters in cold _RARE_ . STO
* It would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning . STO
* Even if the electric power fails after an attack , any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable . STO
* _RARE_ heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature . STO
* _RARE_ clothing and _RARE_ , of course , are essential . STO
* _RARE_ heating or cooking should be avoided . STO
* A flame would use up air . STO
* Some families already have held weekend _RARE_ in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need . STO
* 4 . STO
* If an attack finds you without a prepared shelter Few areas , if any , are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about . STO
* A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation . STO
* On the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside . STO
* The best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house . STO
* A _RARE_ basement can cut the fallout radiation to _RARE_ of the outside level . STO
* The _RARE_ place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and deepest below ground . STO
* If there is time after the warning , the basement shielding could be improved substantially by _RARE_ windows with _RARE_ , dirt , books , magazines , or other heavy material . STO
* 5 . STO
* _RARE_ in apartment buildings Large apartment buildings of _RARE_ or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family _RARE_ . STO
* In general , such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space . STO
* The central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building , with concrete floors , should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling . STO
* The basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling . STO
* The Federal Government is _RARE_ local governments in several places to survey residential , commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide , and for how many people . STO
* The problem for the city apartment _RARE_ is primarily to plan the use of existing space . STO
* Such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management . STO
* A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about _RARE_ Du Pont's share of the General Motors market . STO
* _RARE_ of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted . STO
* Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General _RARE_ eight operating divisions . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ division , long controlled by the _RARE_ brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions . STO
* _RARE_ came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend _RARE_ `` at least in part '' from the needs of General Motors _RARE_ Du Pont's capacity . STO
* `` The fact that sticks out in this _RARE_ record is that the bulk of Du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest . STO
* The inference is _RARE_ that Du Pont's _RARE_ position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' . STO
* 353 U. S. , at _RARE_ . STO
* This Court agreed with the trial court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not _RARE_ by either Du Pont or General Motors '' . STO
* 353 U. S. , at _RARE_ . STO
* However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive _RARE_ in both companies acted _RARE_ and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to _RARE_ anyone , including Du Pont's _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ the Government's claim for relief . STO
* This claim , as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by it , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ violation not only of 7 of the Clayton Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the _RARE_ Act . STO
* The latter provisions _RARE_ any contract , combination , or conspiracy in _RARE_ of _RARE_ or foreign trade , and _RARE_ of , or attempts , combinations , or _RARE_ to _RARE_ , such trade . STO
* However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government's appeal from the _RARE_ of its _RARE_ Act _RARE_ . STO
* It rested its decision solely on 7 , which _RARE_ in pertinent part : `` No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially _RARE_ competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to _RARE_ such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a _RARE_ of any line of commerce . STO
* This section shall not apply to corporations _RARE_ such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about , or in attempting to bring about , the substantial lessening of competition . STO
* '' The purpose of this provision was thus explained in the Court's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its _RARE_ not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their _RARE_ restraints or _RARE_ in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . STO
* The section is _RARE_ whether or not actual restraints or _RARE_ , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended . STO
* '' 353 U. S. , at _RARE_ . STO
* Thus , a finding of conspiracy to _RARE_ trade or attempt to _RARE_ was excluded from the Court's decision . STO
* Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the _RARE_ involved in the _RARE_ between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` _RARE_ and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . STO
* This , however , did not bar finding that Du Pont had become _RARE_ as a _RARE_ of _RARE_ fabrics and _RARE_ to General Motors ; ; that these products _RARE_ a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton Act ; ; that General _RARE_ share of the market for these products was substantial ; ; and that competition for this share of the market was _RARE_ by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of _RARE_ free competition is obviously _RARE_ when no _RARE_ has an advantage over his _RARE_ from an acquisition of his _RARE_ stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute . STO
* We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . STO
* The conclusion upon this record is _RARE_ that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition . STO
* '' 353 U. S. , at _RARE_ . STO
* On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion , the Court _RARE_ the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate relief . STO
* The sole guidance given the Court for _RARE_ the task committed to it was this : `` The judgment must therefore be _RARE_ and the cause _RARE_ to the District Court for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition _RARE_ to the statute . STO
* The District _RARE_ , in the _RARE_ of equitable decrees , are _RARE_ ' with large discretion to model their _RARE_ to fit the _RARE_ of the particular case . STO
* International _RARE_ Co. v. United States , _RARE_ U. S. _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' . STO
* 353 U. S. , at _RARE_ . STO
* This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court . STO
* 2 . STO
* This Court's judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18 , 1957 . STO
* The first _RARE_ conference -- held to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to represent the interest of the stockholders of Du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent _RARE_ -- took place on September 25 , 1957 . STO
* At the _RARE_ , the Government's _RARE_ explained that _RARE_ for the Government and for Du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court . STO
* Du Pont , he said , had proposed _RARE_ of its General Motors stock along with other restrictions on the Du Pont - General Motors relationship . STO
* The Government , _RARE_ these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include _RARE_ of Du Pont's shares of General Motors . STO
* _RARE_ for the Government invited Du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if _RARE_ for Du Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days . STO
* _RARE_ for Du Pont indicated a _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of detailed plans by both sides at an early date . STO
* No previous _RARE_ case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief . STO
* The _RARE_ of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of _RARE_ or _RARE_ in the abstract . STO
* The Court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out . STO
* The Government submitted its proposed _RARE_ on October 25 , 1957 . STO
* The plan called for _RARE_ by Du Pont of its _RARE_ shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a _RARE_ , over a period of ten years . STO
* Christiana _RARE_ Company and Delaware _RARE_ & _RARE_ Company , major stockholders in Du Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a _RARE_ period , of Du Pont's General Motors stock _RARE_ to them , as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned _RARE_ . STO
* If , in the _RARE_ judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not _RARE_ during any given year , he was to be allowed to _RARE_ the court for an extension of time within the _RARE_ period . STO
* In addition , the right to vote the General Motors stock held by Du Pont was to be _RARE_ in Du Pont's stockholders , other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; ; Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be _RARE_ from acquiring stock in or _RARE_ control over General Motors ; ; Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be _RARE_ to have any director or officer in common with General Motors , and vice _RARE_ ; ; and General Motors and Du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any Du Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive _RARE_ rights , or for a grant by General Motors to Du Pont of a _RARE_ right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies . STO
* On motion of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the court directed that a _RARE_ be obtained from the _RARE_ of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the Government's plan . STO
* On May 9 , 1958 , the _RARE_ announced his _RARE_ . STO
* The annual dividends paid to Du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of Du Pont's earnings and profits . STO
* The measure , for federal income tax purposes , of the _RARE_ to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution . STO
* In the case of _RARE_ corporate stockholders , the measure would be the _RARE_ of the fair market value of the shares or Du Pont's tax basis for them , which is approximately _RARE_ per share . STO
* The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned by or _RARE_ to Christiana , Delaware , and the stockholders of Delaware , and deposited with the trustee , would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate . STO
* Du Pont's _RARE_ was filed on May 14 , 1958 . STO
* Under its plan Du Pont would _RARE_ its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares . STO
* Christiana and Delaware would , in turn , be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors shares _RARE_ to them to their own stockholders . STO
* Du Pont would be _RARE_ from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of Du Pont could serve as a director of General Motors without court approval . STO
* Du Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General _RARE_ distributions of stock or _RARE_ rights to its stockholders . STO
* On June 6 , 1958 , General Motors submitted its objections to the Government's proposal . STO
* It argued , _RARE_ _RARE_ , that a _RARE_ order would severely _RARE_ the market value of the stock of both General Motors and Du Pont , with consequent serious loss and _RARE_ to hundreds of thousands of innocent _RARE_ , among them thousands of small _RARE_ and _RARE_ institutions ; ; that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other _RARE_ and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; ; that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would _RARE_ the efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise _RARE_ capital ; ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity . STO
* General Motors _RARE_ _RARE_ that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as required by the _RARE_ of this Court . STO
* The decrees proposed by the _RARE_ _RARE_ were filed in August of 1958 . STO
* These plans , like Du Pont's , contained provisions for passing the vote on Du Pont's General Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their _RARE_ , and other people living in their _RARE_ , as well as other specified persons , were to be totally _RARE_ . STO
* Both plans also _RARE_ common directors , officers , or employees between Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , on the one hand , and General Motors on the other . STO
* It is not a medieval mental _RARE_ or an attitude `` _RARE_ by sense '' to believe that _RARE_ and _RARE_ should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the marriage relationship . STO
* While it is easy enough to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ Of The _RARE_ from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` _RARE_ '' of a married couple may reflect an _RARE_ belief that the _RARE_ between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage . STO
* By making _RARE_ in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has _RARE_ to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path _RARE_ by the recent decision in _RARE_ v. United States , _RARE_ U.S. _RARE_ , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to _RARE_ against her husband over her objection . STO
* One need not _RARE_ in his belief in _RARE_ law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself . STO
* One of these is the solidarity and the _RARE_ relationship of marriage . STO
* The Court's opinion _RARE_ _RARE_ that the _RARE_ conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` _RARE_ an _RARE_ into a rule of law '' . STO
* I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed . STO
* But in any event , I submit that the power to _RARE_ _RARE_ to Congress , not to this Court . STO
* I _RARE_ . STO
* Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious _RARE_ , was _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Military Training and Service Act by refusing to be _RARE_ into the armed forces . STO
* He claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice , he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was denied the right to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim . STO
* _RARE_ : On the record in this case , the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act were fully _RARE_ with ; ; petitioner was not denied due process ; ; and his conviction is sustained . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* ( A ) Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in question was in his file , to which he had access , and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* ( B ) Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's notes and report , especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of _RARE_ recommendation to the appeal board . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* ( C ) Petitioner was not entitled , either in the administrative hearing at the Department of Justice or at his trial , to inspect the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , since he was furnished a resume of it , did not challenge its accuracy , and showed no particular need for the original report . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ C. _RARE_ argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner . STO
* _RARE_ M. _RARE_ argued the cause for the United States . STO
* On the brief were _RARE_ General Rankin , Assistant Attorney General _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ and J. F. Bishop . STO
* Mr. Justice Clark delivered the opinion of the Court . STO
* This is a _RARE_ for refusal to be _RARE_ into the armed services , in violation of the provisions of the _RARE_ Military Training and Service Act , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , 50 , _RARE_ _RARE_ Aj _RARE_ ( A ) . STO
* Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious _RARE_ , _RARE_ that he was denied due process , both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice and at trial . STO
* He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board , and , further , that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department of Justice hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim -- all in violation of the Fifth Amendment . STO
* The trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the Act were fully _RARE_ with and refused to require the production of such documents . STO
* Petitioner was found guilty and _RARE_ to 15 _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The Court of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ F. _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* We granted _RARE_ in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the Act . STO
* _RARE_ U. S. _RARE_ . STO
* We have concluded that _RARE_ claims are controlled by the _RARE_ of Gonzales v. United States , _RARE_ U.S. _RARE_ ( 1955 ) , and United States v. _RARE_ , _RARE_ U.S. 1 ( 1953 ) , and therefore _RARE_ the judgment . STO
* Petitioner registered with Local Board No. 9 , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , on March 17 , 1952 . STO
* His answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of _RARE_ _RARE_ , employed at night by a sugar producer . STO
* He claimed _RARE_ classification as a minister of religion , devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching . STO
* On November 13 , 1952 , he was classified in Class _RARE_ . STO
* On November 22 , 1952 , he wrote the Board , _RARE_ this classification . STO
* He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; ; that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other _RARE_ duties , and that he opposed war in any form . STO
* _RARE_ he was classified _RARE_ . STO
* On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` _RARE_ '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board . STO
* In a _RARE_ review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , _RARE_ him _RARE_ and _RARE_ this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his _RARE_ to kill in defense of his church and home . STO
* Upon administrative approval of the _RARE_ , he was ordered to report for _RARE_ on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so . STO
* He was not _RARE_ , however , and his case was subsequently _RARE_ , in the light of _RARE_ v. United States , _RARE_ U.S. _RARE_ ( 1955 ) . STO
* He was again _RARE_ _RARE_ by the local board . STO
* There followed a customary Department of Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared . STO
* In his report to the Attorney General , the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be _RARE_ only from _RARE_ training and service . STO
* On March 21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the _RARE_ classification . STO
* Its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its _RARE_ in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the _RARE_ _RARE_ reported that he was no longer doing so and , on the contrary , had _RARE_ both his _RARE_ and Bible Student _RARE_ positions . STO
* It reported that he now devoted only some _RARE_ hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities . STO
* His claim was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his _RARE_ and , consequently , upon his _RARE_ and good faith '' . STO
* The appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation . STO
* In his answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` _RARE_ '' was in 1952 . STO
* The appeal board , however , _RARE_ _RARE_ in the Department's recommendation . STO
* Upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for _RARE_ and this _RARE_ followed his failure to do so . STO
* Petitioner first _RARE_ that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him _RARE_ opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching . STO
* But the statement of the local board _RARE_ this claim to petitioner was in his file . STO
* He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have _RARE_ it before the hearing officer . STO
* This he failed to do , _RARE_ that he did not know it to be in his file . STO
* Apparently he never took the trouble to find out . STO
* Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board . STO
* After the recommendation of the Department is _RARE_ to the appeal board , that is the appropriate place for a _RARE_ to lodge his denial . STO
* This he did . STO
* We found in Gonzales v. United States , _RARE_ , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a _RARE_ . STO
* We said there that it was necessary `` that a _RARE_ be given an opportunity to rebut ( the Department's ) recommendation when it comes to the _RARE_ Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' . STO
* _RARE_ U.S. , at _RARE_ . STO
* We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to _RARE_ _RARE_ , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it . STO
* As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the _RARE_ Board which _RARE_ the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be _RARE_ unless there is no basis in fact . STO
* _RARE_ v. United States , _RARE_ U.S. _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ U. S. , at _RARE_ . STO
* But there are other _RARE_ which might be considered more difficult . STO
* At his trial , petitioner sought to secure through _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ notes of the Department's hearing officer , _RARE_ , as well as his report _RARE_ . STO
* Petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice . STO
* He _RARE_ no specific procedural errors or evidence _RARE_ ; ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports might disclose . STO
* Section _RARE_ of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department's recommendation to be placed in a _RARE_ file . STO
* Gonzales v. United States , _RARE_ . STO
* But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the _RARE_ . STO
* While the regulations _RARE_ required that the hearing officer's report be placed in the _RARE_ file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 . STO
* Moreover , the hearing officer's report is but _RARE_ , is directed to the Attorney General and , of course , is not the recommendation of the Department . STO
* It is not essentially different from a _RARE_ of an attorney in the Department of Justice , of which the Attorney General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or _RARE_ . STO
* It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board . STO
* It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board . STO
* Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to _RARE_ the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board . STO
* Petitioner knew that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file . STO
* Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed . STO
* It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial . STO
* In addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . STO
* While there are now _RARE_ of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process . STO
* Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts . STO
* In the light of these circumstances , as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department's recommendation , which petitioner _RARE_ but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no _RARE_ in the hearing officer's report and notes . STO
* Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the _RARE_ report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial . STO
* He did receive a resume of it -- the same that was furnished the appeal board -- and he made no claim of its _RARE_ . STO
* Even now no such claim is asserted . STO
* He bases his present _RARE_ on the general right to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume . STO
* But this is fully answered by United States v. _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* There we held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective service system , _RARE_ _RARE_ conscientious _RARE_ _RARE_ to no guarantee that the _RARE_ reports must be produced for their inspection '' . STO
* _RARE_ U.S. , at _RARE_ . STO
* Even if we were not bound by _RARE_ , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report . STO
* The recommendation of the Department -- as well as the decision of the appeal board -- was based entirely on the local board file , not on an _RARE_ report . STO
* Foreign policy in its total context With this _RARE_ role in mind , I should like to make a few suggestions : What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world . STO
* We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context . STO
* We cannot regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted . STO
* Foreign policy is the total _RARE_ of the American people with peoples and governments abroad . STO
* That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in terms of the total context of our situation . STO
* It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a _RARE_ concern of the Department of Defense . STO
* It is also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce . STO
* We can no longer rely on _RARE_ machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments . STO
* Assistant _RARE_ of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies . STO
* _RARE_ must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy . STO
* I think we need to concern ourselves also with the _RARE_ of action . STO
* Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer . STO
* Unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present . STO
* The movement of events is so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to _RARE_ into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present . STO
* If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs . STO
* _RARE_ taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control . STO
* There will of course be times for delay and _RARE_ . STO
* What I am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so _RARE_ and not through _RARE_ or through _RARE_ or procedural difficulties . STO
* I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant _RARE_ rate of ideas -- an _RARE_ of all _RARE_ . STO
* We want to _RARE_ ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department . STO
* We want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome , that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top . STO
* I hope no one _RARE_ that only Presidential _RARE_ are looked upon as sources of ideas . STO
* The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function , regardless of rank . STO
* Further , I would hope that we could pay attention to little things . STO
* While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world , I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort . STO
* To _RARE_ only a few examples : The wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; ; the attitudes of a _RARE_ _RARE_ who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City , or of a foreign _RARE_ in similar circumstances in our _RARE_ , can easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for . STO
* _RARE_ of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world . STO
* Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them . STO
* I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them . STO
* If the Department of State is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington , it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas . STO
* This does not mean in a purely _RARE_ sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion . STO
* He is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are _RARE_ in his country . STO
* He is expected to _RARE_ , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can . STO
* If any official operation abroad begins to go wrong , we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for _RARE_ action . STO
* The problems of a policy officer It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed _RARE_ in recent years , in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain _RARE_ for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government . STO
* I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior _RARE_ policy officer faces . STO
* This means practically everybody in this room . STO
* Whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine . STO
* The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of _RARE_ : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a _RARE_ , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the _RARE_ of the United Nations or of any other of _RARE_ of international bodies , a news item read at the breakfast table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference , a speech by a Senator or _RARE_ , an article in a _RARE_ , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et _RARE_ , ad _RARE_ . STO
* The policy officer lives with his _RARE_ _RARE_ for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility . STO
* His first thought is about the question itself : Is there a question here for American foreign policy , and , if so , what is it ? STO
* For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is -- that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way in which it is _RARE_ frequently shapes the answer . STO
* _RARE_ it over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question -- tentative because it may change as he _RARE_ it further and because , if no _RARE_ answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered . STO
* Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history . STO
* He is _RARE_ of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which _RARE_ their frequently _RARE_ conclusions . STO
* He knows that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it . STO
* He is already beginning to box the _RARE_ of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing . STO
* He knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a _RARE_ fog . STO
* But he takes his _RARE_ from the great _RARE_ of policy , _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of the United States under international _RARE_ and _RARE_ , basic _RARE_ , and _RARE_ notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such as country papers and National Security Council papers _RARE_ in the Department . STO
* He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the _RARE_ situation with which he is confronted . STO
* He must think about which of these principles must take _RARE_ . STO
* He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance . STO
* He is aware that every _RARE_ important problem _RARE_ _RARE_ into every other problem . STO
* He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole -- when the whole is too large to grasp . STO
* He must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer . STO
* Who should be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government ? STO
* Which American _RARE_ could provide helpful advice ? STO
* Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted ? STO
* What is the probable attitude of other governments , including those less directly involved ? STO
* How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted ? STO
* If action is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem ? STO
* The selection of the wrong tools can mean waste , at best , and at worst an unwanted _RARE_ of the problem itself . STO
* Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? STO
* Should the action be _RARE_ or _RARE_ ? STO
* Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international body ? STO
* For , if so , the path leads through a complex process of _RARE_ _RARE_ which _RARE_ still another dimension to the problem . STO
* _RARE_ for the opinions of mankind What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? STO
* For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it . STO
* He is interested in public opinion for two reasons : first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public _RARE_ about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind . STO
* And , given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support ? STO
* May I add a caution on this particular point ? STO
* We do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential _RARE_ to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action . STO
* In the first place our business is foreign policy , and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his _RARE_ in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ emphasized this point by saying , `` You fellows in the Department of State don't know much about domestic politics '' . STO
* This is an important consideration . STO
* If we sit here reading _RARE_ and looking at _RARE_ _RARE_ and other reports that cross our _RARE_ , we should realize that this is raw , _RARE_ opinion expressed in the absence of leadership . STO
* What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership . STO
* We cannot test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action . STO
* I doubt , for example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan , any _RARE_ expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals . STO
* The problem in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a _RARE_ of utterly complicated factors -- political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative -- to be _RARE_ out and handled within a political system which moves by _RARE_ in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control . STO
* And the policy officer has the _RARE_ of time snapping at his heels . STO
* While there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex , there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women . STO
* The Peace Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family , unless the wife is also accepted for full-time Peace Corps work on the same project . STO
* There should be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service . STO
* In most cases service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary _RARE_ . STO
* Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United States . STO
* Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their _RARE_ abroad are paid . STO
* The guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services . STO
* Rather the principle should be _RARE_ to that of the allowance . STO
* Peace Corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living . STO
* They should live in modest circumstances , avoiding all _RARE_ consumption . STO
* _RARE_ possible they should live with their host country _RARE_ . STO
* Some special health requirements might have to be met . STO
* For example , it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers . STO
* Perhaps existing Public Health Service , State Department and Armed Services medical facilities can be utilized . STO
* For _RARE_ to the U.S. , volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service , based on the length of time served . STO

* In what part of the government should the Peace Corps be established ? STO
* The idea of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people . STO
* _RARE_ for it cuts across party , regional , _RARE_ and other lines . STO
* The Peace Corps , therefore , offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world -- an opportunity for the American people to think _RARE_ and start _RARE_ in their participation in world development . STO
* For this , the Peace Corps should be administered by a small , new , alive agency operating as one component in our whole overseas operation . STO
* _RARE_ the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program , the Peace Corps should be established as an agency in the Department of State . STO
* When the aid operations are _RARE_ the Peace Corps should remain a _RARE_ , functional unit . STO
* Meanwhile , the Peace Corps could be _RARE_ located in _RARE_ facilities and depend on the State Department and _RARE_ for administrative support and , when needed , program assistance . STO
* In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas operations . STO
* 8 . STO
* How and when should the Peace Corps be launched ? STO
* The Peace Corps can either begin in very low gear , with only _RARE_ work undertaken between now and when Congress finally _RARE_ special funds for it -- or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action , with sufficient funds and made available from existing _RARE_ Security _RARE_ to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer . STO
* The Peace Corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to _RARE_ the most qualified people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost . STO
* Nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university _RARE_ . STO
* If launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks , the Peace Corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall . STO
* Within a year or two several thousand might be in service . STO
* It can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated . STO
* 9 . STO
* What would the first projects be ? STO
* In the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects . STO
* The need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to _RARE_ and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest . STO
* There would , however , be a variety of other skills -- medical , agricultural , engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of _RARE_ _RARE_ to existing development projects . STO
* The first year's projects should also be spread through several countries in Latin America , Africa and Asia . STO
* 10 . STO
* How will the Peace Corps be received abroad ? STO
* Although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation , the readiness to receive such manpower , or to receive it from the United States will vary from country to country . STO
* A certain _RARE_ about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters . STO
* _RARE_ political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active _RARE_ . STO
* But there are indications that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers , and that if the volunteers are well chosen , they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends . STO
* It is important , however , that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War but as a contribution to the world community . STO
* In _RARE_ it to other governments and to the United Nations , we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the United Nations _RARE_ the idea and form an international _RARE_ committee . STO
* We should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands . STO
* In any case , our Peace Corps personnel should be offered as _RARE_ _RARE_ in development projects of the _RARE_ and other international agencies . STO
* The Peace Corps is not a _RARE_ or _RARE_ venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership . STO
* Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach . STO
* The Peace Corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the United States the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower . STO
* If presented in this spirit , the response and the results will be _RARE_ better . STO
* 11 . STO
* How will it be financed ? STO
* The already appropriated funds within the discretion of the President and Secretary of State under the _RARE_ Security Act are the only immediately available source of financing this _RARE_ pilot programs of the Peace Corps . STO
* If it is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds , in order to carry out the purposes of the _RARE_ Security Act through this new peaceful program , this will be a hopeful sign to the world . STO
* Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year . STO
* _RARE_ , Congress should consider _RARE_ the Peace Corps to receive _RARE_ from American businesses , unions , civic organizations and the public at large . STO
* For this must be the project of the whole American people . STO
* An Advisory Council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding . STO
* _RARE_ should also be taken to link the Food for Peace Program with the Peace Corps , so that foreign _RARE_ _RARE_ by the sale of U.S. surplus food under _RARE_ _RARE_ can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel . STO
* The extent to which participating bodies such as U. S. voluntary agencies , universities , international organizations , and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully _RARE_ . STO
* 12 . STO
* Is it worth the cost and the _RARE_ ? STO
* No matter how well conceived and efficiently run , there probably will be _RARE_ . STO
* These could be _RARE_ and have a serious effect both at home and abroad . STO
* But as the popular response suggests , the _RARE_ of the Peace Corps is very great . STO
* It can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions . STO
* It can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country . STO
* It can also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world . STO
* With thousands of young Americans going to work in developing areas , millions of Americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before . STO
* With colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program , and with students looking toward Peace Corps service , there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student _RARE_ . STO
* The letters home , the _RARE_ later given by returning members of the Peace Corps , the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad -- all this may _RARE_ to provide a substantial popular base for responsible American policies toward the world . STO
* And this is meeting the world's need , too , since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world . STO
* The Peace Corps thus can add a new dimension to _RARE_ world policy -- one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting . STO
* As you said in your State of the Union message , `` The problems are towering and unprecedented -- and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well '' . STO
* To the Congress of the United States : I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps -- a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower . STO
* I have today signed an _RARE_ Order establishing a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis . STO
* The temporary Peace Corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in _RARE_ more effective plans for a permanent organization . STO
* In addition , by starting the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall . STO
* This temporary Peace Corps is being established under existing authority in the _RARE_ Security Act and will be located in the Department of State . STO
* Its initial expenses will be paid from _RARE_ currently available for our foreign aid program . STO
* Throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires . STO
* Our own freedom , and the future of freedom around the world , depend , in a very real sense , on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity , _RARE_ from the bonds of hunger , ignorance and poverty . STO
* One of the greatest _RARE_ to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly _RARE_ economics , and with the _RARE_ to put that capacity to work in the _RARE_ , the mountains , the towns and the factories of _RARE_ of struggling nations . STO
* The vast task of economic development _RARE_ requires skilled people to do the work of the society -- to help teach in the schools , construct development projects , demonstrate modern methods of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge . STO
* To meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we are _RARE_ the establishment of a Peace Corps -- an organization which will _RARE_ and train American volunteers , sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations . STO
* This organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical _RARE_ by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work . STO
* They will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments , acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice . STO
* There is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them . STO
* _RARE_ habitat resources In 1960 _RARE_ of the _RARE_ million recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the _RARE_ sale of hunting and fishing _RARE_ . STO
* This use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by _RARE_ . STO
* The long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and _RARE_ . STO
* The wildlife habitat management proposals for the _RARE_ period are : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units , _RARE_ proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and Grasslands are located , as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs , including ( A ) _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ habitat surveys and investigations on the _RARE_ million acres of National Forests and Grasslands , ( B ) _RARE_ habitat surveys and investigations on the _RARE_ miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and ( C ) participation in planning , inspection , and control phases of all habitat improvement , land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States , other Federal agencies , and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other _RARE_ values . STO
* 3 . STO
* _RARE_ food and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas . STO
* 4 . STO
* _RARE_ wildlife _RARE_ , food patches , and game ways in dense _RARE_ by clearing or controlled burning on _RARE_ acres . STO
* 5 . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ miles of fishing streams and _RARE_ acres of _RARE_ by _RARE_ banks , _RARE_ _RARE_ cover , and _RARE_ channel improvements . STO
* _RARE_ The total adverse impact of disease , insects , fire , weather , destructive animals , and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized . STO
* They kill and destroy , _RARE_ or prevent reproduction and growth , _RARE_ and damage values , and _RARE_ uses . STO
* The loss in growth of _RARE_ because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about _RARE_ billion board feet . STO
* If it were not for the effect of destructive agencies , _RARE_ growth would have been nearly twice as great as the _RARE_ billion board feet in 1952 . STO
* About _RARE_ percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease , 20 percent to insects , 17 percent to fire , and 18 percent to weather , animals , and various other causes . STO
* These destructive forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the _RARE_ and their _RARE_ _RARE_ , and upon the other _RARE_ forest resources . STO
* The long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and _RARE_ sustained yield of products and services . STO
* This can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of _RARE_ and disease _RARE_ . STO
* In addition to direct protection measures , more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease . STO
* _RARE_ from insects and disease In the _RARE_ period , it is proposed that _RARE_ and disease control on the National Forest System be stepped up to a level of prevention , detection , and control of _RARE_ and disease _RARE_ that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large _RARE_ toward the end of the initial period . STO
* This will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection . STO
* The work will consist of : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ of present activities through ( A ) quicker , more extensive , and more thorough surveys to detect _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; ( B ) more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial _RARE_ to cause widespread damage ; ; ( C ) quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic . STO
* The initial _RARE_ activities would cover about twice the _RARE_ currently being treated . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ of present _RARE_ _RARE_ control work plus extension of control to _RARE_ acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production . STO
* The objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed . STO
* 3 . STO
* _RARE_ a program to control _RARE_ _RARE_ on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young _RARE_ _RARE_ on better growing _RARE_ . STO
* 4 . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses . STO
* _RARE_ from fire It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial _RARE_ , all critical _RARE_ , and other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak _RARE_ . STO
* This will include _RARE_ million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection . STO
* An additional 15 million acres will be given a _RARE_ degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation . STO
* _RARE_ these levels of protection from fire calls for : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ , modernization , and development of fire control to a _RARE_ and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and _RARE_ fires before they spread beyond permitted standards . STO
* This is to be accomplished by nearly _RARE_ the present level of preventive effort , detection , skilled _RARE_ _RARE_ , and equipment use . STO
* This will include a _RARE_ program of training and development of personnel . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention , for _RARE_ of fires while small , and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely . STO
* 3 . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to _RARE_ areas . STO
* This work will cover the most serious _RARE_ of all land needing such treatment , and will consist of burning _RARE_ acres of highly _RARE_ debris concentration , _RARE_ _RARE_ on _RARE_ acres of high _RARE_ areas , prescribed burning on _RARE_ million acres , _RARE_ _RARE_ fuel on _RARE_ acres , and clearing and maintaining _RARE_ miles of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ from other damage _RARE_ control work for the _RARE_ period will be aimed at control of the most serious _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , such as _RARE_ and mice , on _RARE_ areas of _RARE_ and commercial _RARE_ . STO
* These areas comprise about half of the total area of _RARE_ _RARE_ on the National Forests . STO
* Approximately _RARE_ million acres of _RARE_ and _RARE_ million acres of _RARE_ would be treated in this period . STO
* Control would be limited to those _RARE_ for which economical means of control are known . STO
* _RARE_ and trails The transportation system which serves the National Forests is a complex of _RARE_ and access roads and trails under various _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* This system is divided into a forest highway system , administered by the Secretary of Commerce , and a forest development road and trail system , administered by the Secretary of _RARE_ . STO
* Both of these systems are essential for the production , development , and use of the National Forests . STO
* In the forest highway system , there are now _RARE_ miles of public roads . STO
* These are mostly through _RARE_ that carry traffic going from one destination to another . STO
* Because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties , this Development Program for the National Forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed . STO
* It is estimated that about _RARE_ miles of forest _RARE_ will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests . STO
* In the forest development road and trail system , there are now _RARE_ miles of roads and _RARE_ miles of _RARE_ foot and horse trails . STO
* These roads are largely of less than highway standards , and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests . STO
* _RARE_ and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of _RARE_ . STO
* It is estimated that about _RARE_ miles of forest development roads , and _RARE_ miles of trails , constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood , water , _RARE_ , and wildlife and recreation resources of the National Forests on a continuing basis . STO
* The ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection . STO
* It will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and _RARE_ . STO
* The presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as : ( A ) the protection of _RARE_ , timber , and wildlife resources from fire , insects , and disease ; ; ( B ) the balanced use of recreation , hunting , and fishing areas ; ; ( C ) the volume of timber that can be _RARE_ , especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business _RARE_ ; ; ( D ) the level of _RARE_ cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly _RARE_ losses resulting from fire , _RARE_ , insects , and disease ; ; ( E ) the protection of _RARE_ lands from _RARE_ and _RARE_ by animals . STO
* The existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes that is not otherwise possible . STO
* Furthermore , roads that give access to National Forest timber are _RARE_ which pay their own way over a period of years . STO
* Use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the _RARE_ the roads serve . STO
* The long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services . STO
* For the year _RARE_ this means _RARE_ ( A ) the protection requirements of a _RARE_ producing at least 200 million _RARE_ of water each year , ( B ) recreation and wildlife resources used each year by _RARE_ million visitors , ( C ) a timber _RARE_ supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet , and ( D ) 60 million acres of _RARE_ . STO
* Service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about _RARE_ miles of new roads and _RARE_ miles of new trails , along with the _RARE_ to higher standards of about _RARE_ miles of roads and _RARE_ miles of trails . STO
* About _RARE_ miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads . STO
* About 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year _RARE_ . STO
* Program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the _RARE_ period _RARE_ are as follows : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ the construction and _RARE_ of about _RARE_ miles of _RARE_ roads and _RARE_ miles of trails . STO
* This constitutes about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities . STO
* Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by _RARE_ of National Forest timber , but paid for by the Government through adjustment of _RARE_ prices . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ maintenance to full standards on the _RARE_ miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period . STO
* Land adjustment , land purchase , land use Within the units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular . STO
* In some units , National Forest ownership is well blocked together . STO
* In many others , the previous _RARE_ of land under the public land laws , or the way in which land was available for purchase , resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership . STO
* Within _RARE_ boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands , there are about _RARE_ acres in _RARE_ ownership . STO
* One consequence is the occurrence of occasional _RARE_ because private owners of some _RARE_ object to public programs of use on neighboring National Forest or other Federal land , or because such _RARE_ are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring National Forest land . STO
* Some _RARE_ held _RARE_ are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands . STO
* And some , which are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes , are _RARE_ or in need of expensive rehabilitation , and are contributing nothing to the economy ; ; there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be _RARE_ or changed . STO
* _RARE_ in this last category are situated largely in the _RARE_ portions of the Eastern States . STO
* The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of _RARE_ which comprise key _RARE_ for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development , or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National Grasslands . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the U.S. military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest _RARE_ in history . STO
* The change of emphasis from _RARE_ to _RARE_ warfare must be made with care , _RARE_ that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other . STO
* Our military forces must be capable of _RARE_ successfully with any _RARE_ which may be forced upon us , from limited _RARE_ to _RARE_ nuclear general war . STO
* Forces and military personnel strength . STO
* -- This budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level -- a _RARE_ strength of _RARE_ men and women in the active forces . STO
* The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and _RARE_ men ; ; a Navy of _RARE_ active ships and _RARE_ men ; ; a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with _RARE_ men ; ; and an Air Force of _RARE_ combat wings and _RARE_ men . STO
* If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must _RARE_ to the changing character and missions of the active forces . STO
* _RARE_ and combat readiness must take _RARE_ over mere numbers . STO
* Under modern conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve . STO
* I have requested the Secretary of Defense to _RARE_ the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare . STO
* Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army Reserve . STO
* Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National _RARE_ contained in the 1960 Department of Defense _RARE_ Act should likewise be dropped . STO
* I strongly recommend to the Congress the _RARE_ of _RARE_ floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . STO
* I again proposed a reduction in the Army National _RARE_ and Army Reserve -- from their present _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , respectively , to _RARE_ and _RARE_ by the end of the fiscal year 1961 . STO
* These _RARE_ are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the _RARE_ in support of our national security objectives . STO
* Military personnel costs . STO
* -- About _RARE_ of the expenditures for the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military personnel . STO
* These expenditures are estimated to be _RARE_ billion , an increase of _RARE_ million over 1960 , reflecting additional _RARE_ pay of career personnel , more _RARE_ , an increased number of men drawing _RARE_ pay , and social security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) . STO
* _RARE_ pay costs are increased by _RARE_ million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . STO
* These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of _RARE_ million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961 . STO
* _RARE_ , rates of pay for retired military personnel have been _RARE_ to current rates of pay for active personnel . STO
* The 1958 military pay act _RARE_ from this established formula by providing for a _RARE_ increase rather than a _RARE_ increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 . STO
* I _RARE_ pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates . STO
* _RARE_ and maintenance . STO
* -- _RARE_ for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be _RARE_ billion in 1961 , which is _RARE_ million more than in 1960 . STO
* The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment . STO
* A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program , as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential . STO
* Also , the program for _RARE_ modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures . STO
* Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year . STO
* Other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour , up _RARE_ in two years , and of each _RARE_ hour , up _RARE_ . STO
* In total , these increases in operating costs _RARE_ the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces . STO
* In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate _RARE_ of section _RARE_ of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ) . STO
* This section _RARE_ the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense _RARE_ from carrying out certain _RARE_ involving real property unless they come into agreement with the _RARE_ on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of _RARE_ . STO
* As I have stated previously , the Attorney General has advised me that this section _RARE_ fundamental _RARE_ principles . STO
* Accordingly , if it is not _RARE_ by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to _RARE_ the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise . STO
* Basic _RARE_ communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air Force , and Federal _RARE_ Agency . STO
* The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise . STO
* _RARE_ has already been proposed to _RARE_ the sale of these _RARE_ systems in Alaska , and its early _RARE_ is desirable . STO
* _RARE_ , research , and construction . STO
* -- Approximately _RARE_ of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs . STO
* In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at _RARE_ billion , compared to _RARE_ billion in 1960 . STO
* The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic devices . STO
* _RARE_ for _RARE_ are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 . STO
* New _RARE_ authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) _RARE_ _RARE_ million , which is _RARE_ million below that enacted for 1960 . STO
* On the other hand , the new authority of _RARE_ million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is _RARE_ million higher than for 1960 . STO
* These _RARE_ _RARE_ in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the years ahead . STO
* The Department of Defense _RARE_ acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items . STO
* As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more _RARE_ than the general law , _RARE_ known as the _RARE_ American Act . STO
* I urge once again that the Congress not _RARE_ this rider . STO
* The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without _RARE_ other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress . STO
* The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history . STO
* Some weapons systems have become _RARE_ while still in production , and some while still under development . STO
* Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological _RARE_ on any one weapon system , in itself , often _RARE_ the relative importance of other competitive systems . STO
* This has necessitated a continuous review and _RARE_ of the defense program in order to _RARE_ resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been _RARE_ by events . STO
* Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was _RARE_ have since been completely eliminated . STO
* For example , the importance of the _RARE_ 2 , a very promising _RARE_ _RARE_ missile designed to be launched by _RARE_ submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced _RARE_ ballistic missile launched by _RARE_ submarines . STO
* Another example is the recent _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , a long-range _RARE_ with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the _RARE_ . STO
* The substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles . STO
* _RARE_ the high cost of the _RARE_ system -- over _RARE_ billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project . STO
* Meanwhile , other air defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message . STO
* The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans . STO
* _RARE_ in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and _RARE_ , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas _RARE_ ballistic missile . STO
* The impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the _RARE_ fuel program . STO
* This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a _RARE_ fuel to provide an extra _RARE_ of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers . STO
* _RARE_ technical problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the _RARE_ fuel program . STO
* As a result , the scope of this project has been sharply _RARE_ . STO
* These examples _RARE_ the importance of even more searching _RARE_ of new major development programs and even more penetrating and _RARE_ analyses of the _RARE_ of future technology . STO
* The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to _RARE_ it . STO
* _RARE_ forces . STO
* -- The _RARE_ power of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear _RARE_ capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war . STO
* The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , _RARE_ aircraft , and _RARE_ and intermediate range missiles . STO
* The second capability is represented by our _RARE_ ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready _RARE_ capable of _RARE_ early emergency _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ Air Command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability . STO
* One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the _RARE_ , a long-range _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about _RARE_ , would be _RARE_ to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier . STO
* The first Atlas _RARE_ are now operational , the first two _RARE_ submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year , and the first _RARE_ _RARE_ next year . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ is planned to be operational about _RARE_ . STO
* By _RARE_ , several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their _RARE_ established . STO
* Thus , the need for the _RARE_ as a strategic weapon system is doubtful . STO
* However , I am recommending that development work on the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ be continued . STO
* It is expected that in _RARE_ two _RARE_ aircraft will be available for flight testing . STO
* By that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system . STO
* I am recommending additional _RARE_ of the improved _RARE_ of the _RARE_ ( the _RARE_ with the new _RARE_ engine ) and procurement of the _RARE_ _RARE_ medium _RARE_ , together with the supporting _RARE_ _RARE_ in each case . STO
* These additional modern bombers will replace some of the older _RARE_ medium bombers ; ; one _RARE_ can do the work of several _RARE_ which it will replace . STO
* _RARE_ are also included in this budget to continue the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ wings with the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ missile . STO
* In the coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ missiles also will be _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale and delivery of commodities , including the classes , types andor _RARE_ of food grain , the time and circumstances of _RARE_ of the rupees accruing from such sale , and other relevant matters . STO

* The United States recognizes the desire of India to _RARE_ , as quickly as possible , a substantial part of the one million _RARE_ reserve stock of rice provided for in this Agreement to assist in _RARE_ the internal markets for this _RARE_ in India . STO
* Under this Agreement the first annual review of rice _RARE_ will be made in August 1960 . STO
* At that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of the United States supplies of rice available for Title 1 , disposal , _RARE_ production , consumption and stocks of food _RARE_ , other _RARE_ from the United States and countries friendly to the United States , _RARE_ storage capacity , and other related factors , any increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice _RARE_ which is currently planned for procurement during the first year . STO

* The two Governments agree that the _RARE_ of purchase authorizations for _RARE_ and rice providing for purchase after June 30 , 1961 , shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available under Title 1 , of the Act at that time .

STO
* In the event the rupees set aside for loans under Section 104 ( E ) of the Act are not advanced within six years from the date of this Agreement because the Export-Import Bank of Washington has not approved loans or because proposed loans have not been mutually _RARE_ to the Export-Import Bank of Washington and the Department of Economic Affairs of the Government of India , the Government of the United States of America may use the rupees for any purpose authorized by Section 104 of the Act .

* The Government of India further agrees in cooperation with the Government of the United States , to coordinate the use of grant and loan funds provided for in paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , with such direct dollar assistance as may be made available by the Government of the United States of America , so that both sources of financing may be _RARE_ to specific and clearly _RARE_ economic development programs and projects . STO
* 3 . STO
* It is agreed that any goods delivered or services rendered after the date of this agreement for projects within categories A , B , and C under paragraph 2 above which may later be approved by the United States will be _RARE_ for financing from _RARE_ granted or _RARE_ to the Government of India . STO
* 4 . STO
* With regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under Article 2 , of the Agreement , the understanding of the Government of the United States of America , with respect to both paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , is as follows : ( 1 ) Local _RARE_ will be advanced or _RARE_ to the Government of India for financing agreed projects under paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , of the Agreement upon the presentation of such _RARE_ as the United States may specify . STO
* ( 2 ) The Government of India shall maintain or cause to be maintained books and records adequate to identify the goods and services financed for agreed projects pursuant to paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , of the Agreement , to disclose the use thereof in the projects and to record the progress of the projects ( including the cost thereof ) . STO
* The books and records with respect to each project shall be maintained for the duration of the project , or until the _RARE_ of three years after final _RARE_ for the project has been made by the United States , _RARE_ is later . STO
* The two Governments shall have the right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and all other documents , correspondence , _RARE_ and other records involving _RARE_ relating to agreed projects . STO
* The Government of India shall enable the authorized representatives of the United States to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and services financed under the projects , and shall furnish to the United States all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning the _RARE_ matters and the expenditures related thereto . STO
* This broad _RARE_ leaves within our discretion ( subject to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the public interest ) both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive , and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided . STO
* 3 . STO
* The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast ( AM ) band , from _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies , each _RARE_ to some extent with reception of the other . STO
* The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be _RARE_ at any point where either of the stations _RARE_ a usable signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective _RARE_ power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day . STO
* Other factors playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the _RARE_ cycle , ground conductivity along the transmission path , _RARE_ and _RARE_ noise , and others . STO
* With the existence of these many factors , some of them variable , it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a _RARE_ basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances . STO
* Rather , such assignments are made , as they must be , on the basis of certain overall rules and standards , representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem , taking into account for each situation some of the variables ( e.g. , power and station _RARE_ ) and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation . STO
* An example of the overall standards applied is the _RARE_ ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as _RARE_ . STO
* By this standard , it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved , _RARE_ interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station _RARE_ signal is of an intensity _RARE_ or more of the strength of station _RARE_ signal at that point . STO
* 4 . STO
* The _RARE_ ratio for cochannel interference _RARE_ one of the fundamental _RARE_ principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and _RARE_ -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of _RARE_ interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service . STO
* A second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies . STO
* This is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners , resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the _RARE_ layer in the upper atmosphere known as the _RARE_ . STO
* All AM stations _RARE_ both skywave and groundwave signals , at all hours ; ; but during the middle daytime hours these skywave _RARE_ are not reflected in any substantial quantity , and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are , in general , negligible . STO
* But during nighttime hours the skywave _RARE_ are reflected from the _RARE_ , thereby creating the possibility of one _RARE_ rendering service , via skywave , at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal , and at the same time vastly _RARE_ the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies . STO
* Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to _RARE_ different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime _RARE_ in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night . STO
* 5 . STO
* It was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions , and vice _RARE_ , is not an _RARE_ process , but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset , and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise . STO
* During the period of about 4 hours around sunset , skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions _RARE_ ; ; during the same period around sunrise , skywave transmission is declining , until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance . STO
* However , in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations , representing an averaging of conditions , and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the _RARE_ points between daytime and nighttime conditions . STO
* It was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset , respectively , should be used for this purpose . STO
* Accordingly , the _RARE_ rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations . STO
* Class 2 , stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset ( for daytime class 2 , stations ) or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 , station where located west of the class 2 , station ( for _RARE_ class 2 , stations ) . STO
* The same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 , stations operating on regional channels , which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other . STO
* With respect to nighttime assignments , the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves ( figs. 1 and 2 of _RARE_ _RARE_ of the rules ) giving average skywave values . STO
* These curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data . STO
* It was recognized that skywave signals , because of their reflected nature , are of great _RARE_ and subject to wide _RARE_ in strength . STO
* For this reason , the more uncertain skywave service was _RARE_ `` secondary '' in our rules , as compared to the _RARE_ , more reliable groundwave `` primary service '' , and , for both skywave service and skywave interference , signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular _RARE_ level is _RARE_ -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service , 10 percent of the time for skywave interference . STO
* _RARE_ policies 6 . STO
* As mentioned , the allocation of AM stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations . STO
* The rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the Nation . STO
* Our objectives , as we have stated many times , are -- ( 1 ) To provide some service to all listeners ; ; ( 2 ) To provide as many _RARE_ of service to as many listeners as possible ; ; ( 3 ) To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible . STO
* Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent _RARE_ in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for _RARE_ achievement of the others . STO
* Accordingly , the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies , and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations . STO
* Some _RARE_ frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant Class 1 , -- A or Class 1 , -- B _RARE_ stations , designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service -- both groundwave and ( at night ) skywave -- over large areas and at great distances , being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective . STO
* In dealing with these frequencies , the objective listed first above -- provision of service to all listeners -- was _RARE_ ; ; the other objectives were _RARE_ to it . STO
* The class 1 , stations on these clear channels are protected to their _RARE_ groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference . STO
* With respect to skywave service rendered at night , class 1 , -- A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1 , -- A operation , and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference _RARE_ they may be received ; ; class 1 , -- B stations are protected at night to their _RARE_ _RARE_ time skywave contours against cochannel interference . STO
* Since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference , only class 1 , stations are capable of rendering skywave service . STO
* But nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course _RARE_ skywave interference to groundwave service , interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it . STO
* 7 . STO
* With respect to other frequencies , these are _RARE_ as regional or local , and assigned for use by class 3 , and class 4 , stations , respectively , stations operating generally with lower power . STO
* In the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies , the provision of long-range service has to some extent been _RARE_ to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities , and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible . STO
* 8 . STO
* As mentioned , the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service , free from destructive interference . STO
* During nighttime hours , because of the intense skywave propagation then _RARE_ , no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels , if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it . STO
* Therefore , under our _RARE_ allocation rules , on some of these channels no station other than the dominant ( class 1 ) -- A ) station is permitted to operate at night , so that the 1 , -- A station can render service , interference free , wherever it can be received . STO
* On the remainder of the clear channels , the dominant ( class 1 ) -- B stations are protected as described above , and the relatively small number of secondary ( class 2 ) ) stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate _RARE_ andor with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 , stations . STO
* In the daytime , on the other hand , since skywave transmission is relatively _RARE_ , it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels . STO
* Additional class 2 , assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 , stations or to each other , and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local _RARE_ for a large number of communities . STO
* Such additional daytime class 2 , assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies , and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them . STO
* Similarly , on the regional channels many class 3 , stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with _RARE_ _RARE_ andor lower power . STO
* 9 . STO
* _RARE_ , the question presented for decision in the present _RARE_ _RARE_ proceeding is whether our decision ( in _RARE_ ) to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset , is sound as a basis for AM _RARE_ , or whether , in the light of later developments and new understanding , skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account , and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours . STO
* The history of the proceeding 10 . STO
* The decision reached in _RARE_ was made after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof . STO
* Since then , there has been a _RARE_ increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena . STO
* In 1947 , _RARE_ were filed with the Commission by various _RARE_ stations _RARE_ that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours , from class 2 , stations whose signals were being reflected from the _RARE_ so as to create skywave _RARE_ .

* The one- or _RARE_ _RARE_ , of which there have been too many recently , may do more harm than good ; ; for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving _RARE_ in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued ; ; and they are dashed , no less , by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit . STO
* For the making of selections on the basis of _RARE_ requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of _RARE_ whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time . STO
* The central group of the Foundation's _RARE_ are , at any one period of time , the members of our Advisory Board , consisting , now , of _RARE_ men and women . STO
* They are chosen by the Foundation's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own _RARE_ _RARE_ in their different fields of scholarship and the arts . STO
* Their locations in all parts of the United States , and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic _RARE_ also are factors in the _RARE_ minds . STO
* For this concept of an Advisory Board , _RARE_ to the Board of Trustees , we are _RARE_ to the late President of _RARE_ University , A. Lawrence _RARE_ , a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration . STO
* That we had the wit and wisdom to _RARE_ Mr. _RARE_ concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been , it may be said truly , pretty _RARE_ good . STO
* For , in accordance with Mr. _RARE_ concept of an _RARE_ board , our selections are made by experienced _RARE_ who give both constancy and consistency to our processes and our _RARE_ . STO
* And lest we should become too consistent , in the sense of becoming _RARE_ of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts , the Foundation's Board of Trustees maintains a _RARE_ -- not a flow ! STO
* -- of new members through the Advisory Board . STO
* Two committees of members of the Advisory Board constitute the committees of selection -- one for the selection of Fellows from Canada , the United States , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ area and one for the selection of Fellows from the Latin American _RARE_ and the Republic of the _RARE_ . STO
* To the members of our Advisory Board , and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection , the Foundation is _RARE_ for its successes of choice of Fellows . STO
* We are , as we know , utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get ; ; and quality of advice , added to devotion to the Foundation's purposes and _RARE_ , we do get from our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day . STO
* But the facts about our Advisory Board and its _RARE_ duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice , both reliable and imaginative , on which to base our selections of Fellows . STO
* For example , the interest of past members of the Foundation's Advisory Board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were , formally , members of that Board . STO
* And , besides , there are a large number of scholars , artists , _RARE_ of music , _RARE_ , poets , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , lawyers , servants of government , and men of affairs -- hundreds , indeed -- who serve the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and _RARE_ out of their experience . STO
* To all , the Foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks : to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of _RARE_ in words how grateful we are . STO
* It is a _RARE_ of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management . STO
* The same is true of every foundation . STO
* During the _RARE_ reviewed in this Report , our Board of Trustees named able men , younger than the rest of us , to the Board and to top management to insure future _RARE_ of the _RARE_ administration of the Foundation's affairs : Dr. James Brown _RARE_ , _RARE_ , President of the _RARE_ Telephone _RARE_ , was elected to the Board of Trustees . STO
* He is a member both of the National Academy of _RARE_ and of the American _RARE_ Society ; ; and he has served our country well as a scientific _RARE_ on international _RARE_ . STO
* Dr. _RARE_ N. Ray , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and Professor of English in the University of Illinois , was appointed _RARE_ Secretary General . STO
* The Trustees of the Foundation appointed Dr. Ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary General upon the _RARE_ eventual _RARE_ . STO
* Dr. Ray is a _RARE_ of the Foundation -- appointed _RARE_ to assist his studies of William _RARE_ _RARE_ and of H. G. _RARE_ -- and , before his appointment to the Foundation's executive staff , had been given our highest _RARE_ _RARE_ , appointment to the Advisory Board . STO
* _RARE_ further to the Foundation's officers , Dr. James F. _RARE_ , for eleven years our _RARE_ _RARE_ as _RARE_ Secretary , was promoted to be Secretary . STO
* He is a _RARE_ , with the great merit of a _RARE_ long view . STO
* Also appointed to the Foundation's staff , as Assistant Secretary , is Mr. J. _RARE_ Smith , Jr. . STO
* Mr. Smith , like the present Secretary General , is a lawyer ; ; and lawyers -- with the great _RARE_ that they are trained to read `` the fine print '' carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields -- are _RARE_ even in a foundation office . STO
* The present Secretary General has been the Foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the Foundation's establishment _RARE_ years ago . STO
* But even he will not last indefinitely and the _RARE_ new arrangements are , quite simply , made to assure _RARE_ continuity in the Foundation's policies and practices . STO
* The effective recognition of _RARE_ and its _RARE_ has to be learned and is not learned in a day , nor even in a year . STO
* We are not given to _RARE_ , neither personally nor in these _RARE_ . STO
* On the contrary , if this be an _RARE_ era as is commonly said , we see it as an era of opportunity . STO
* For , _RARE_ that there are great _RARE_ problems to be solved , these problems make great demands ; ; and by their demanding tend to create resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth . STO
* Of this , examples are _RARE_ : _RARE_ speaking his funeral _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ after _RARE_ and making it a _RARE_ of freedom ; ; _RARE_ writing the _RARE_ of Independence _RARE_ the _RARE_ of revolution ; ; Christ preaching the _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , close to his ultimate sacrifice ; ; _RARE_ speaking with `` the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ voice '' -- ; ; _RARE_ words -- in the days of the Spanish _RARE_ threats ; ; Isaac _RARE_ , at the age of twenty-three , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ `` to two and fifty places '' during the great _RARE_ year in England , _RARE_ ; ; Winston _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ when Britain stood alone against the armed forces of _RARE_ less than twenty years ago ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ of outer space , answering _RARE_ questions of science and philosophy , in the face of possible wars of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ et _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , as the Roman poet , _RARE_ , declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today . STO
* It gives , indeed , cause for _RARE_ to remember what many _RARE_ of the past produced ; ; and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind . STO
* For example , out of the social _RARE_ of the English industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens ; ; and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those _RARE_ for all Western men -- until today -- , in the _RARE_ West , these social _RARE_ substantially do not exist . STO
* The solutions were not arrived at by any _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ but by men of government -- lawyers , most of them -- and men of business . STO
* These were educated men , who , as Mr. Justice _RARE_ was fond of saying , formed their _RARE_ out of experience under the burden of responsibility . STO
* That is , to put it _RARE_ , they had to run their businesses at a profit , or they had to get the votes to get elected . STO
* Nevertheless , they made _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ that capitalism would never pay the `` workers '' -- to use _RARE_ word -- more than a _RARE_ wage , with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the _RARE_ pockets with the result , in turn , that the _RARE_ between the rich and the poor would _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ of the poor increase . STO
* But as all understand who have eyes to see , nothing of the kind has happened ; ; indeed , the contrary has happened . STO
* The _RARE_ between the `` rich '' and the `` poor '' has narrowed , in the _RARE_ Western world , to the point that the word `` poor '' is hardly applicable . STO
* And the reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity . STO
* Some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit ; ; and even putting it that way would not prove that _RARE_ was anything but wrong . STO
* Sir Henry _RARE_ _RARE_ , a hundred years before _RARE_ was a force to be _RARE_ with , wrote his brilliant legal _RARE_ , that `` the progress of society is from status to contract '' . STO
* The _RARE_ of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do . STO
* Hence , the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice . STO
* The greater the range of freedom for individual men , the greater the range of choice ; ; the greater the range of choice , the greater the rate of change . STO
* For change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future . STO
* But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose , men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not , cannot , progress . STO
* The eternal truth is that progress -- due , as it always is , to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart . STO
* And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not _RARE_ in a foundation report , let me _RARE_ them with the _RARE_ that , under _RARE_ there would have been no capital with which to _RARE_ the Foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed , _RARE_ in every way , toward their _RARE_ , their creative efforts for the good of mankind . STO
* During the year 1959 , we granted _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; in 1960 , we granted _RARE_ . STO
* As _RARE_ , our _RARE_ are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts . STO
* We do not favor one field over another : we think that all inquiry , all _RARE_ and artistic creation , is good -- provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life , as all _RARE_ scholarship and artistic creation does . STO
* Indeed , if pressed , we would say what the late Robert _RARE_ , American painter , said to a pupil , `` Anything will do for a subject : it's what you do with it that counts '' . STO
* Thus , we have no part , and want none , in current discussions of the relative importance of science , the social studies , the _RARE_ , the creative arts . STO
* We want no part in such discussions , because we think them largely _RARE_ ; ; and we think them largely _RARE_ because , for true _RARE_ of _RARE_ , every _RARE_ and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of view . STO
* When the Brown & Sharpe _RARE_ Company reached its _RARE_ year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world . STO
* With its history standing _RARE_ all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical _RARE_ of its _RARE_ , Joseph R. Brown , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ for precision and progress in _RARE_ technology . STO
* Joseph R. Brown grew up in the _RARE_ and enterprise of New England between _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* He was early exposed to the mechanical world , and in his youth often helped his father , David Brown , master clock and _RARE_ , as he _RARE_ his trade . STO
* At the age of 17 he became an apprentice _RARE_ at the shop of _RARE_ & Harris in Valley _RARE_ , Rhode Island , and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after _RARE_ , he went into business for himself in _RARE_ , making _RARE_ and small tools . STO
* This enterprise led to a _RARE_ combination beginning in _RARE_ , under the name D. Brown & _RARE_ , a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown & Sharpe . STO
* The years of _RARE_ partnership with his father were _RARE_ . STO
* In _RARE_ , a _RARE_ fire _RARE_ their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois , settling on a land grant in his declining years . STO
* Joseph Brown continued in business by himself , quickly _RARE_ the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a _RARE_ in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world . STO
* Much of his genius , of course , sprang from his familiarity with clock movements . STO
* During these early years the repair of _RARE_ and _RARE_ and the building of special _RARE_ for church _RARE_ formed an important part of the young man's occupation . STO
* He became particularly interested in graduating and precision measurement during the _RARE_ , and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period . STO
* But his business also grew , and we are told that Mr. Brown found it increasingly difficult to _RARE_ as much time to his creative thinking as his _RARE_ led him to desire . STO
* It must have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 , _RARE_ , Joseph Brown made the _RARE_ entry in his job book , in his _RARE_ _RARE_ style , `` _RARE_ Sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice '' . STO
* The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr. Brown , for in the third year of his _RARE_ _RARE_ was offered a full partnership in the firm ; ; the company became `` J. R. Brown & Sharpe '' , and entered into a new and important period of its development . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most _RARE_ -- time for `` _RARE_ '' , and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision _RARE_ which most interested him at that time . STO
* By _RARE_ , the new partnership announced the precision _RARE_ _RARE_ as the first fruit of their joint efforts . STO
* The basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in _RARE_ by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and _RARE_ engine . STO
* That development , in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant _RARE_ in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular graduating , in index _RARE_ , and in many other fields where accuracy was a _RARE_ requirement . STO
* Throughout their careers , both Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical _RARE_ . STO
* Several efforts were made in this direction , and though not all of them survive to this day , the Brown & Sharpe wire _RARE_ system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today . STO
* As one development followed another , the company's reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture . STO
* In _RARE_ , the partnership began manufacturing the _RARE_ & Gibbs sewing machine . STO
* As the story goes , Mr. Gibbs , who originally came from the back counties of the _RARE_ of Virginia , saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous _RARE_ sewing machine . STO
* _RARE_ as to what made it work , he built a crude model of it in wood , and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread , enabling the crude machine to take _RARE_ . STO
* When he showed this model as his `` solution '' as to how the _RARE_ sewing machine operated , he was told he was `` wrong '' , and discovered to his amazement that the _RARE_ _RARE_ , which was unknown to him in detail , used two _RARE_ while the one that he had _RARE_ used only one . STO
* Thus was _RARE_ the single thread sewing machine , which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. _RARE_ decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company _RARE_ its manufacture . STO
* The new work was a _RARE_ to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment . STO
* The _RARE_ screw machine , now known as the Brown & Sharpe hand screw machine , takes its _RARE_ directly from Mr. Brown's efforts to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine . STO
* Mr. Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by _RARE_ _RARE_ the means for _RARE_ the _RARE_ , by _RARE_ automatic feeding devices for the stock , and reversible tap and die _RARE_ . STO
* In _RARE_ , Mr. Brown's attention was called to yet another basic production problem -- the manufacture of twist _RARE_ . STO
* At that time , during the Civil War , Union _RARE_ were being manufactured in Providence and the _RARE_ to _RARE_ them were being _RARE_ with _RARE_ files . STO
* This process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor Mr. Brown's imagination of the possibilities in the situation . STO
* The child of this problem was Mr. Brown's famous _RARE_ No. 1 _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ from which is descended today's universal _RARE_ milling machine used throughout the world . STO
* The original machine , bearing its famous _RARE_ number , is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe _RARE_ Center in Providence . STO
* During the Civil War period Mr. Brown also _RARE_ the Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear _RARE_ , a basic invention which ultimately _RARE_ the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics . STO
* Up until that time it had been possible to make _RARE_ for making gear teeth , but they were good for only one _RARE_ . STO
* As soon as the time came for _RARE_ , the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new _RARE_ had to be made . STO
* This process made the economical manufacture of _RARE_ _RARE_ until some way could be found to permit the repeated _RARE_ of gear tooth _RARE_ without the loss of the precision form . STO
* Mr. Brown's invention achieved this and , as a _RARE_ , formed the _RARE_ of Brown & _RARE_ position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the _RARE_ when _RARE_ by other methods . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ , as a common workshop tool , also _RARE_ much to J. R. Brown . STO
* Although Mr. Brown was not himself its _RARE_ ( it was a French idea ) , it is typical that his _RARE_ first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use . STO
* So it was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in _RARE_ , they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown & Sharpe in yet another field where it _RARE_ its leadership to this day . STO
* The final achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine . STO
* That achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine , which made its appearance in _RARE_ at the Philadelphia _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This machine , like its milling _RARE_ , was the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ used to this very day in precision _RARE_ shops throughout the world . STO
* _RARE_ with J. R. Brown's other major developments , the universal grinding machine was _RARE_ _RARE_ in setting the course of Brown & Sharpe for many years to come . STO
* Following Mr. Brown's death , there came forward in the Brown & Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company . STO
* One such man was Samuel Darling . STO
* As head of the firm Darling & _RARE_ , Mr. Darling began by challenging Brown & Sharpe to its _RARE_ competition during the _RARE_ and early _RARE_ . STO
* In _RARE_ , however , a _RARE_ was called between the companies , and the partnership of Darling , Brown & Sharpe was formed . STO
* Between that year and the buying out of Mr. _RARE_ interest in _RARE_ , a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling , Brown & Sharpe , and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous _RARE_ . STO
* Perhaps the outstanding standard _RARE_ of Mr. Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr. _RARE_ J. _RARE_ , whose mechanical genius closely _RARE_ that of Mr. Brown , and whose particular _RARE_ was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown & Sharpe to manufacture _RARE_ , and therefore its products , with an accuracy _RARE_ anything then available elsewhere in the world . STO
* Also important on the Brown & Sharpe scene , at the turn of the century , was Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ of the company from _RARE_ to 1910 . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men . STO
* He was an _RARE_ _RARE_ of the Brown & Sharpe _RARE_ Program and personal _RARE_ to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company . STO
* In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown & Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial _RARE_ throughout the nation and even abroad . STO
* _RARE_ with the death of _RARE_ Sharpe in _RARE_ , the name of Henry D. Sharpe was for more than 50 years closely _RARE_ with the destiny of the company . STO
* During his _RARE_ , the company's physical plant was enormously expanded , and the length and _RARE_ of the Brown & Sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world . STO
* During the early part of this century , the Brown & Sharpe works in Providence were _RARE_ as the largest single manufacturing _RARE_ devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world . STO
* During these years the company's product line followed the basic _RARE_ laid down by Mr. Brown . STO
* It expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines , from simple _RARE_ gear cutting machines to gear _RARE_ machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business , from _RARE_ _RARE_ universal milling machines to a broad line of _RARE_ controlled _RARE_ and manufacturing type milling machines . STO
* In the grinding machine field , expansion went far from universal _RARE_ alone and took in cylindrical _RARE_ , surface _RARE_ , and a wide variety of special and _RARE_ models . STO
* In 1951 , Henry D. Sharpe , Jr. succeeded his father and continued the company's development as a major factor in the _RARE_ equipment business . STO
* The company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ Division is currently producing Brown & Sharpe single _RARE_ automatic screw machines , grinding machines of many types , and knee and _RARE_ milling machines . STO
* _RARE_ added is the Brown & Sharpe _RARE_ _RARE_ machine which _RARE_ the company to an entirely new field of tool development . STO
* In the Industrial Products Division , the company _RARE_ and markets a wide line of precision _RARE_ and inspection equipment , _RARE_ tools -- including _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* In the _RARE_ _RARE_ Division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling _RARE_ , end mills and _RARE_ . STO
* Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 . STO
* _RARE_ income was _RARE_ , or _RARE_ per share on _RARE_ common shares currently outstanding , as compared to _RARE_ or _RARE_ per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares . STO
* Sales and other operating income increased _RARE_ from _RARE_ in 1959 to _RARE_ in 1960 . STO
* This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development . STO
* In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate _RARE_ higher than during 1959 . STO
* _RARE_ for current year Our current rate of _RARE_ orders has now _RARE_ and unless this trend can be _RARE_ , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 . STO
* However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry _RARE_ support to the _RARE_ expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 . STO
* _RARE_ for sound tax policy In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a _RARE_ U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on _RARE_ business in the next few years . STO
* Such a depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries , thus helping to _RARE_ the position of the dollar in foreign exchange . STO
* Research and development Our research and development program , serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world , continues to have primary emphasis at Leesona . STO
* This program is based on the policy of _RARE_ and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality , fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money . STO
* Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment , in terms of efficiency and _RARE_ . STO
* But more important , we believe , it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil _RARE_ _RARE_ and our more recent Uniconer automatic _RARE_ machine . STO
* _RARE_ increased On this basis , our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to _RARE_ future growth in sales and earnings . STO
* Much of this necessary increase in research and development , though properly _RARE_ to current expenses , is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity , usually over a period of several years . STO
* _RARE_ yarn machines In December we began to ship our _RARE_ stretch yarn machines . STO
* These machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in _RARE_ stretch and _RARE_ fabrics . STO
* During the past year , great progress has been made by the _RARE_ mills in creating new stretch and _RARE_ fabrics . STO
* _RARE_ centers are now _RARE_ broad acceptance of sports _RARE_ and improved `` wash and wear '' dresses and _RARE_ made from these fabrics . STO
* This machine , operating at speeds up to _RARE_ _RARE_ per minute , is believed to provide one of the _RARE_ mechanical operations in industry today . STO
* It transfers yarn directly from the _RARE_ largest package into ideal supply _RARE_ for use on Unifil _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ stretch yarn fabrics . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ Our new _RARE_ ring _RARE_ for glass fiber yarns is _RARE_ well in our _RARE_ mills . STO
* Later in the year , additional types of this Leesona _RARE_ will be made available to mills for other _RARE_ fibers and natural yarns . STO
* These machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds , larger yarn _RARE_ , and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn . STO
* This we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment . STO
* Uniconer Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of _RARE_ for production of the Uniconer automatic _RARE_ machine . STO
* This work is _RARE_ on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year . STO
* This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery _RARE_ last year and was well received by the industry . STO
* The potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The Uniconer has several outstanding features -- it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment ; ; it _RARE_ an automatic _RARE_ device on each _RARE_ , and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new _RARE_ as the running end is exhausted . STO
* Because the _RARE_ winding process is a relatively _RARE_ operation for the mill , the almost complete _RARE_ provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production , at the same time _RARE_ quality . STO
* Many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine . STO
* New Unifil application A new application for the Unifil _RARE_ _RARE_ , running single filling for box _RARE_ , will broaden mill use of this equipment . STO
* _RARE_ machines A new spinning _RARE_ machine has been developed to _RARE_ the use of our _RARE_ machine in the production of _RARE_ yarns . STO
* It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed . STO
* This new machine takes up _RARE_ yarn from _RARE_ or _RARE_ and winds large _RARE_ at speeds up to _RARE_ feet per minute . STO
* It is equipped with an automatic _RARE_ device to reduce waste and handling time . STO
* Our _RARE_ machines and our _RARE_ are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high _RARE_ yarns , in several fiber producing plants . STO
* We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field . STO
* _RARE_ plans We are interested in further _RARE_ into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently _RARE_ our efforts in that direction . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ research Our _RARE_ _RARE_ Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells . STO
* The cooperation of our exclusive American _RARE_ , _RARE_ & _RARE_ _RARE_ Division of United _RARE_ Corporation , has been important in this work . STO
* In addition to its major effort on fuel cells , _RARE_ _RARE_ Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the Defense Department , other government agencies and for our own account . STO
* _RARE_ is currently supplying components vital to the _RARE_ and _RARE_ programs . STO
* We have recently entered into an agreement with _RARE_ _RARE_ De _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on _RARE_ materials . STO
* The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and _RARE_ of such materials in the United States . STO
* Initially we will import the _RARE_ materials and _RARE_ from France but later we will manufacture in this country . STO
* There is a rapidly growing demand for this material , primarily from the military . STO
* Further research , we believe , will develop important commercial applications . STO
* A project for the Air Force has been completed in which the _RARE_ infrared _RARE_ device was developed for area _RARE_ of _RARE_ or dangerous gases . STO
* We are _RARE_ research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity . STO
* The rapid advance in science today suggests many other _RARE_ of investigation . STO
* Our plan is to keep _RARE_ of these advances , and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities . STO
* New plant facilities Early in August we broke ground for a new _RARE_ plant in Warwick , Rhode Island , which will house our textile and _RARE_ winding machinery operations . STO
* _RARE_ is well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year . STO
* All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick . STO
* _RARE_ in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962 . STO
* An _RARE_ _RARE_ of the new plant is shown on the front cover . STO
* The building will contain _RARE_ square feet , approximately the same as our present plant . STO
* However , its modern _RARE_ _RARE_ is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs . STO
* A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick site , four miles from Cranston , was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force . STO
* We have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties , effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant . STO
* British subsidiary During the year our British subsidiary , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , expanded its plant in _RARE_ , England , and added machine tool capacity . STO
* The operations of its other plant in _RARE_ and _RARE_ former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the _RARE_ town of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and equipment were _RARE_ and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis . STO
* The area available at _RARE_ is approximately three times the size of the former _RARE_ and Manchester locations . STO
* In addition , land has been purchased to permit _RARE_ the size of the plant in the future . STO
* Financial developments The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction . STO
* It will be _RARE_ on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island , a _RARE_ organization , which will _RARE_ us for the cost of construction . STO
* We will then occupy the new plant under _RARE_ , with an _RARE_ to purchase . STO
* These arrangements are , in our opinion , very favorable to Leesona . STO
* _RARE_ financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The _RARE_ Manhattan Bank . STO
* In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant , we have invested approximately _RARE_ for machinery and equipment at Cranston , and for new machinery , plant and equipment at _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* We believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment . STO
* Long term loans have been reduced by _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ increased _RARE_ to _RARE_ during the year and should decline in coming months . STO
* Thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position . STO
* _RARE_ contracts In accordance with the _RARE_ contract signed in May , 1959 , with the International Association of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , wages of _RARE_ employees were increased by _RARE_ in May , 1960 , and pay levels for _RARE_ _RARE_ employees were increased proportionately . STO
* In addition , Blue _RARE_ coverage for all employees and their _RARE_ was extended to provide the full cost of _RARE_ hospital _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ benefits In addition to direct _RARE_ and wages , the Company paid or _RARE_ during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees : During the _RARE_ year ended December 31 , 1960 , 23 employees retired , making a total of _RARE_ currently retired under the _RARE_ _RARE_ plan . STO
* At December 13 , 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence , as trustee for payment of past and future service _RARE_ to qualified members of the plan , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago . STO
* Another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living . STO
* As in many other industries , rising costs and intense competition , both domestic and foreign , have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years . STO
* _RARE_ efficiency In textiles , as elsewhere , a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity . STO
* As a _RARE_ and manufacturer of textile production machinery , Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production , yet maintain both quality and flexibility . STO
* _RARE_ of shifting styles The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in _RARE_ or home decoration . STO
* _RARE_ must be adjusted accordingly , at minimum cost and quickly . STO
* In addition , production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of _RARE_ , as well as _RARE_ . STO
* Following the term of service in Japan , each _RARE_ returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community . STO
* The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program . STO
* _RARE_ activities the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital _RARE_ to campus life . STO
* _RARE_ facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ Club , and smaller _RARE_ of wind and string players . STO
* All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ have _RARE_ during the week preceding the first day of classes . STO
* The _RARE_ Club is open to all students and faculty with no _RARE_ necessary for membership . STO
* In addition to the many _RARE_ of these organizations throughout the college year , there are _RARE_ by students of the music department , by members of the music faculty , and by visiting artists . STO
* Student musical organizations are the _RARE_ of Carleton and the _RARE_ ( men's vocal groups ) , and the _RARE_ ( a women's singing group ) . STO
* These _RARE_ organizations include eight to ten members each ; ; they perform at many campus social events . STO
* _RARE_ activities from the founding of the College those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion . STO
* _RARE_ are offered in _RARE_ , the philosophy and history of religion , Christian thought and history , and the Bible . STO
* Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students . STO
* A college service of worship is held each Sunday morning at eleven o'clock in the Chapel . STO
* The _RARE_ are given by the College _RARE_ , by members of the faculty , or by guest _RARE_ . STO
* Music is furnished by the Carleton College _RARE_ . STO
* Chapel services are held weekly . STO
* These services at which _RARE_ is voluntary are led by the _RARE_ , by the President of the College , by selected faculty members , students , and visitors . STO
* The service is brief and variety in forms of worship is _RARE_ . STO
* A Sunday evening program provides _RARE_ _RARE_ , music , drama , and films related to the issues of the _RARE_ tradition . STO
* _RARE_ is required at the College Service of _RARE_ or at the Sunday _RARE_ Program or at any regularly organized service of public worship . STO
* Each semester every student must attend ten of the services or religious meetings . STO
* _RARE_ at the Chapel Service is voluntary . STO
* _RARE_ organizations include the groups described below . STO
* The _RARE_ and _RARE_ at Carleton are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry out their general purposes . STO
* _RARE_ meetings are held for the whole membership , usually with a guest speaker , while smaller discussion groups meet more frequently . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new _RARE_ , to broaden their interests , and to engage in _RARE_ service projects . STO
* There are other organizations representing several of the _RARE_ groups . STO
* _RARE_ are the following : _RARE_ Student _RARE_ , _RARE_ Club ( _RARE_ ) , Christian Science _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ , _RARE_ ( Jewish ) , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ Student Association , _RARE_ Club ( Roman Catholic ) , _RARE_ Student _RARE_ , United Student _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , and _RARE_ _RARE_ ( Methodist ) . STO
* Student religious organizations are _RARE_ under the _RARE_ _RARE_ Committee , a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association . STO
* The _RARE_ churches include the following : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Missouri _RARE_ , and _RARE_ ) , Methodist , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Roman Catholic . STO
* _RARE_ the purpose of producing plays at the College is _RARE_ : to provide the Carleton students with the best possible opportunity for _RARE_ within the limits set by the maturity and experience of the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ facilities available ; ; to encourage the practice of _RARE_ the theater ; ; and to develop a _RARE_ audience for good drama and sensitive performance . STO
* _RARE_ activity at the College is organized and carried on by The Carleton _RARE_ , which is to say by all students who are so inclined to advance these aims . STO
* For the _RARE_ season , The Carleton _RARE_ have announced Blood _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , The _RARE_ Of The _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ and Fletcher and A _RARE_ For The _RARE_ by Eugene _RARE_ , with a _RARE_ production of The _RARE_ _RARE_ by Tennessee Williams . STO
* Student workshop this workshop , located in _RARE_ Hall , provides facilities for students to work in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , textile printing , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* These _RARE_ activities are conducted under supervision of the Director of the Student _RARE_ . STO
* The workshop is open five afternoons and two _RARE_ each week . STO
* A student organization , _RARE_ , is open to any student interested in increasing his understanding and appreciation of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ arts in their historical , technical , and productive _RARE_ . STO
* The group meets once a week in the _RARE_ Student _RARE_ . STO
* They are _RARE_ and advised by members of the Art Department . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ program at Carleton is considered an integral part of the activities of the College and operates under the same _RARE_ procedure and controls as the academic work . STO
* The physical education program for men recognizes the value of participation in competitive sports in the development of the individual student and aims to give every man an opportunity to enter some form of athletic competition , either _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* The same standards for admission , for _RARE_ to receive _RARE_ or _RARE_ , and for scholastic performance at college apply to all students . STO
* A faculty committee on _RARE_ , responsible to the faculty as a whole , exercises control over the athletic program of the College . STO
* It concerns itself with : 1 . STO
* The policies which govern the program 2 . STO
* The preservation of desirable balance between the athletic and academic programs of the College 3 . STO
* The approval of athletic schedules 4 . STO
* The maintenance of _RARE_ Conference _RARE_ standards Carleton is a member of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Conference and _RARE_ by its _RARE_ rules . STO
* In addition to these rules , Carleton has added the following : 1 . STO
* A student who while in _RARE_ at Carleton College _RARE_ in an athletic contest during the school year , other than that sponsored by the College , shall be _RARE_ _RARE_ to participate in _RARE_ _RARE_ at Carleton College and will also face permanent suspension from the institution . STO
* The school year does not end for any student until he has completed his last examination of the semester . STO
* 2 . STO
* A student to be _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of any Carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least _RARE_ . STO
* The `` C '' club is composed of the men of the College who have won an official letter in Carleton _RARE_ . STO
* The purpose of the Club is to promote better athletic teams at Carleton and to increase interest in them among the student body . STO
* This is done by encouraging the entire male student body to participate in either the _RARE_ or _RARE_ sports program and by _RARE_ the Carleton _RARE_ . STO

STO
* The College also _RARE_ each year The Report Of The _RARE_ and a monthly _RARE_ entitled Carleton College _RARE_ . STO
* In _RARE_ with the Alumni Association of Carleton College , an _RARE_ magazine , The _RARE_ Of The Carleton Alumni , is _RARE_ and mailed seven times a year by the _RARE_ Publications Office and the Alumni Office . STO
* At intervals an _RARE_ _RARE_ is issued . STO
* These publications may be secured as follows : The _RARE_ _RARE_ from the Director of _RARE_ and other issues from the Publications Office . STO
* In January , 1960 , the first issue of The Carleton _RARE_ , a _RARE_ literary magazine , was published by the College . STO
* The magazine , _RARE_ by members of the Carleton Department of English , includes _RARE_ by authors from both within and beyond the Carleton community . STO
* Student publications The _RARE_ , the college newspaper , is _RARE_ by students and published by the College under the supervision of the Publications Board . STO
* ( See page 100 . STO
* ) It is issued weekly throughout the college year . STO
* The Publications Board holds annual competitive _RARE_ for places on the editorial and business _RARE_ . STO
* The editor , sports editor , and student business manager are chosen in December , the new staff assuming responsibility for the paper at the beginning of the second semester . STO
* The paper _RARE_ excellent practice for students interested in the field of _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ , the college annual , is published in the fall of each year . STO
* The _RARE_ serves as a record of campus organizations and student activities during the year . STO
* The Publications Board receives applications for the positions of editor and business manager and makes the _RARE_ in the spring previous to the year of publication . STO
* _RARE_ of The _RARE_ staff are _RARE_ by the editor and business manager and appointed by the Publications Board . STO
* _RARE_ , a _RARE_ literary magazine , is published by the students of the College . STO
* It is the purpose of this magazine to serve as an _RARE_ for student creative writing . STO
* The editor and business manager of _RARE_ are appointed by the Publications Board . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ station A _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ station , _RARE_ , heard only in the campus _RARE_ , is owned and operated by the students to provide an _RARE_ for student dramatic , musical , literary , technical , and other talents , and to furnish information , music , and entertainment for campus listeners . STO
* Over a hundred students participate in the planning and production of the daily program schedule . STO
* _RARE_ provides experience for students who wish to pursue careers in radio . STO
* Student government the Carleton Student Association includes all students in college and is intended `` to work for the _RARE_ of Carleton College by providing student government and student participation with the college administration in the formulation and execution of policies which _RARE_ to student life and activities '' . STO
* The Carleton Social _RARE_ is a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association . STO
* _RARE_ activities for the entire campus are planned by the _RARE_ Board . STO
* In recent months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current _RARE_ in business and _RARE_ are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future . STO
* And yet , despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new _RARE_ for the year as a whole . STO
* The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the _RARE_ inventories that have characterized many previous _RARE_ in the business cycle . STO
* This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of _RARE_ and _RARE_ to shift the inventory burden back on the _RARE_ , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level . STO
* In the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets . STO
* Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 . STO
* The total value of our industry's shipments , at factory prices , increased from _RARE_ billion in 1959 to approximately _RARE_ billion as a result of increases in all of the major _RARE_ of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement . STO
* I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 . STO
* Home entertainment sales up _RARE_ the largest percentage of _RARE_ sets such as _RARE_ and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about _RARE_ billion , compared to _RARE_ billion in 1959 . STO
* Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July ; ; set production ( excluding those _RARE_ for the _RARE_ market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was _RARE_ after the usual vacation _RARE_ in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* For the year as a whole , retail sales of TV sets probably came to _RARE_ million against _RARE_ million in 1959 ; ; however , production came to only _RARE_ million compared to _RARE_ million . STO
* In contrast to the lower _RARE_ of TV , total radio production increased from _RARE_ million sets to _RARE_ million ( excluding _RARE_ ) . STO
* Both home and _RARE_ _RARE_ were in excellent demand , with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven ; ; sales and production of home sets were about equal at _RARE_ million units . STO
* _RARE_ set production came to about _RARE_ million compared to _RARE_ million in 1959 . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ also had a good year , reflecting the growing _RARE_ of _RARE_ sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to _RARE_ that characterized the _RARE_ market . STO
* The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of _RARE_ to step up their buying plans for _RARE_ goods . STO
* I would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - _RARE_ but that _RARE_ levels should show a favorable comparison , with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent _RARE_ suggest they will . STO
* I look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at _RARE_ million sets for the year , but I look for some decline in _RARE_ from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of _RARE_ - _RARE_ million sets . STO
* I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about _RARE_ million , slightly below 1960 , but above 1959 . STO
* Military electronics to grow 1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics , which _RARE_ about _RARE_ billion compared to _RARE_ billion in 1959 . STO
* It is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in _RARE_ , which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance . STO
* It has been correctly pointed out by _RARE_ people in the industry that it is probably _RARE_ to expect a continuation of the _RARE_ growth of _RARE_ or better that characterized the decade of the _RARE_ , and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still _RARE_ areas of our defense capability . STO
* While this may well be true in general , I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions . STO
* Among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the _RARE_ and _RARE_ programs , strengthening of the _RARE_ alert system of the _RARE_ Air Command , and improved _RARE_ _RARE_ systems . STO
* Research and development expenditures connected with the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as _RARE_ are expected to increase substantially . STO
* Research , development test and evaluation funds , devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft , and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by _RARE_ . STO
* Still later , the realm of space technology will show substantial gains ; ; it has been estimated that spending by the National _RARE_ and Space Administration will rise from less than _RARE_ million in fiscal 1960 to more than _RARE_ billion by _RARE_ , and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ defense procurement called for in the 1961 _RARE_ has already begun to make itself felt in an _RARE_ in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it , and it has been suggested that an additional _RARE_ billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962 . STO
* Although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be _RARE_ , on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least _RARE_ billion . STO
* Industrial electronic equipment _RARE_ by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing , sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment _RARE_ _RARE_ billion compared to _RARE_ billion in 1959 . STO
* The market for _RARE_ and other _RARE_ continues to _RARE_ at the rate of about _RARE_ annually , reaching some _RARE_ million in 1960 . STO
* _RARE_ estimates look for this market to approximately _RARE_ by the late _RARE_ , under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of _RARE_ and retailing , industrial process control , and information storage and _RARE_ . STO
* In the industrial field , prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright . STO
* For the near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ; sales should slightly exceed 1960 , however , and reach _RARE_ billion . STO
* _RARE_ parts In addition to the three major original equipment _RARE_ of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year . STO
* This is now a _RARE_ billion business , up from _RARE_ billion in 1959 , and should reach _RARE_ billion in 1961 . STO
* The markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment _RARE_ of the industry . STO
* _RARE_ for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half , but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates . STO
* In the military field , _RARE_ orders turned down early in the year , and remained rather slow until late fall when the _RARE_ in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components . STO
* Sales of _RARE_ in 1960 _RARE_ _RARE_ million , compared to _RARE_ million in 1959 despite substantial price _RARE_ in virtually all types . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ about _RARE_ million units against _RARE_ million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to _RARE_ million units worth approximately _RARE_ million in 1961 . STO
* Sales of passive components , such as _RARE_ and resistors , although not growing as fast as those of _RARE_ were ahead of 1959 this year , and should increase again in 1961 . STO
* In sum , I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about _RARE_ to _RARE_ billion , despite the _RARE_ in the business outlook generally . STO
* As I have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer _RARE_ goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the _RARE_ figures close to those of 1960 ; ; on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ; and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the _RARE_ . STO
* The appointment of _RARE_ B. Devey as General _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , Inc. , of _RARE_ , Connecticut , a leading manufacturer of _RARE_ and _RARE_ controlled _RARE_ electrical controls , has been announced by David B. _RARE_ , Vice President , Special Products . STO
* Mr. Devey will be responsible for the commercial expansion of _RARE_ line of electronic and electrical power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers , working closely with Walter J. Brown , President and Director of _RARE_ of the recently acquired _RARE_ subsidiary . STO
* Mr. Brown will at the same time _RARE_ expansion of _RARE_ _RARE_ design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as _RARE_ manager of _RARE_ Special Products _RARE_ , which _RARE_ a wide line of digital electronic components , _RARE_ component _RARE_ , and high temperature _RARE_ wires . STO
* Mr. Devey first came to _RARE_ in 1953 as a _RARE_ _RARE_ in the Field _RARE_ Department , coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington , D. C. , where he was an electronic _RARE_ engaged in _RARE_ warfare studies . STO
* During World War 2 , , he was a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy . STO
* Mr. Devey is a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Institute of _RARE_ , and attended the United States Naval Academy _RARE_ School _RARE_ in electronic engineering . STO
* He was named _RARE_ _RARE_ of the Special Products Division of _RARE_ when it was _RARE_ in 1958 , and was later promoted to his present post . STO
* Mr. Devey is a member of the Institute of Radio _RARE_ , and is _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Industries Association Committee on _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. Brown , well-known , _RARE_ _RARE_ , prior to founding _RARE_ was at various times section leader in radio research at _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Co. , _RARE_ ; ; chief engineer of the radio set division of _RARE_ and _RARE_ Industries , _RARE_ , the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in Great Britain ; ; director of engineering at _RARE_ of Great Britain , _RARE_ , and vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president at The _RARE_ Development Co. , _RARE_ , Ohio . STO
* He has a _RARE_ of Science from the University of Manchester , England . STO
* Mr. Brown presently has over _RARE_ patents to his credit _RARE_ back to _RARE_ . STO
* He is a fellow of the American Institute of _RARE_ _RARE_ , and a senior member of the Institute of Radio _RARE_ . STO
* He is a member of the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , London , a registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio , and a _RARE_ electrical engineer in Great Britain . STO
* The promotion of Robert E. _RARE_ to the position of Assistant _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by Frederick S. _RARE_ , _RARE_ of _RARE_ Control Field Service . STO
* The appointment was made in a move to _RARE_ the engineering services offered to the _RARE_ of electronic systems through assistance in _RARE_ _RARE_ problems . STO
* Between meetings he helps the president keep track of _RARE_ matters . STO
* Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed _RARE_ _RARE_ , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs . STO
* Since faculty see themselves as _RARE_ professionals rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is _RARE_ to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course . STO
* The faculty believes that broad _RARE_ is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship . STO
* The president _RARE_ faculty members to remember , in _RARE_ their _RARE_ , that they share no collective responsibility for the _RARE_ income nor are they personally _RARE_ for _RARE_ decisions . STO
* He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration . STO
* How well do faculty members govern themselves ? STO
* There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government . STO
* They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government . STO
* They , too , need to learn to _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to _RARE_ themselves about education as a whole , an area that would benefit by more faculty attention . STO
* Although _RARE_ insist on governing themselves , they grant little _RARE_ to a member who actively _RARE_ in college or university government . STO
* There are , nevertheless , several things that the president can do to _RARE_ participation and to _RARE_ the _RARE_ of those who are willing to exercise their privilege . STO
* He can , for example , present significant _RARE_ issues to the _RARE_ . STO
* He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the _RARE_ faculty ; ; by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments ; ; by _RARE_ good _RARE_ between the committees and the administration ; ; by _RARE_ the number of committees . STO
* Despite the many _RARE_ for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration , _RARE_ of a lack of communication _RARE_ . STO
* The cause is as often neglect as _RARE_ to disclose . STO
* A busy president , _RARE_ with a problem and its _RARE_ and _RARE_ by pressures to meet _RARE_ , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is . STO
* The need for _RARE_ and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of _RARE_ . STO
* To increase faculty influence and decrease tension , many _RARE_ have established a standing _RARE_ committee with which they can discuss problems _RARE_ . STO
* The president has little influence in _RARE_ _RARE_ changes , but if he looks ahead two , three , or five years to _RARE_ issues and throw out challenging ideas , he can open the way for _RARE_ , and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take . STO
* Success will require _RARE_ , sensitivity to faculty _RARE_ , patience , and persistence . STO
* The critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually _RARE_ and _RARE_ itself so that its performance will match changing social demands . STO
* Great _RARE_ do not automatically _RARE_ themselves . STO
* _RARE_ can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty . STO
* They serve not only as _RARE_ for their areas , but they also contribute to _RARE_ decision making . STO
* The president who _RARE_ strong men who have an _RARE_ or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance . STO
* _RARE_ members depend on their department _RARE_ to promote their interests with the administration . STO
* The administration at the same time , looks to the _RARE_ for strategic aid in building stronger departments . STO
* One way that this can be done , other than by _RARE_ new _RARE_ _RARE_ , is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance . STO
* The quality of a _RARE_ leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty . STO
* By supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards , the president can encourage faculty leadership . STO
* _RARE_ he can best help them by _RARE_ that _RARE_ criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and _RARE_ to . STO
* The academic _RARE_ should take a direct , long-term interest in faculty development . STO
* An alert _RARE_ will _RARE_ all through the year on personnel needs , plans for the future , qualifications of those on the job , and bright prospects elsewhere . STO
* For the maintenance of a long-term program , the departments , and particularly their _RARE_ , are strategic . STO
* They evaluate and _RARE_ candidates for appointment and promotion . STO
* To provide an independent judgment for the president , the academic _RARE_ also _RARE_ candidates thoroughly . STO
* At some colleges and universities , a faculty committee _RARE_ and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates . STO
* Some faculty members and many _RARE_ _RARE_ faculty review groups because they either repeat _RARE_ actions or act _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* They can be effective , however , if their members set high standards for candidates and _RARE_ substantial time to the work . STO
* At one university , the president cites the faculty review committee as `` a _RARE_ partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty '' . STO
* Before the president _RARE_ a candidate to the trustees , the administration _RARE_ the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere . STO
* The president or _RARE_ _RARE_ some of his publications to form the _RARE_ possible evaluation of the quality of his mind . STO
* No good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered , although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria . STO
* To avoid passing over quiet , _RARE_ teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion , review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made _RARE_ whether or not they have been recommended for _RARE_ by their departments . STO
* There are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly . STO
* He should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for _RARE_ , to guard against the mistake of making this _RARE_ serious _RARE_ turn solely upon the man's former achievements . STO
* No one can be as effective as the president in _RARE_ older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their _RARE_ is quite different . STO
* In particular , the president may have to _RARE_ all his _RARE_ powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale . STO
* On those rare occasions when a faculty member on _RARE_ is not meeting the standards of the institution , the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action . STO
* A true university , like most successful marriages , is a unity of _RARE_ Without forcing all components into a single pattern , the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider _RARE_ of knowledge at its highest level , which a university -- in contrast to a _RARE_ -- should stand for . STO
* _RARE_ colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into _RARE_ goals . STO
* Each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as : Shall we require a liberal education built around a _RARE_ core for all _RARE_ ? STO
* Or shall we permit early _RARE_ in scientific and technological subjects ? STO
* In the first instance , adequate appropriate reading materials and library _RARE_ must be planned . STO
* In the second , more shops , _RARE_ , and staff will be required . STO
* For the president , a master plan looking ahead five years ( the maximum reach for sound forecasting ) , offers several practical advantages . STO
* Trustees , faculty , and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made , instead of afterwards . STO
* _RARE_ plant and equipment can be efficiently developed . STO
* _RARE_ new programs can be examined for _RARE_ to goals and for present and future financial fitness . STO
* More than one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to attract major _RARE_ . STO
* It _RARE_ confidence in his _RARE_ determination to establish goals and to achieve them . STO
* Before deciding where it is going , however , a college or university must know where it is . STO
* The first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty , by outside _RARE_ , or by a combination of the two . STO
* It should _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , faculty , organization , buildings , faculty work _RARE_ , and potential for growth in _RARE_ and size . STO
* _RARE_ of the master plan will inevitably be _RARE_ . STO
* Some departments will attack their new goals _RARE_ ; ; others may drag their feet . STO
* _RARE_ may be readily _RARE_ for some purposes but not others . STO
* A plan must therefore be brought up to date _RARE_ , possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer . STO
* To provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions , a number of institutions have established offices of _RARE_ research . STO
* Some offices have very broad responsibilities , touching on almost all aspects of a _RARE_ _RARE_ program . STO
* Their duties include evaluation of the information collected and preparation of recommendations . STO
* More often , these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data . STO
* The _RARE_ opportunity for _RARE_ education reaches its highest point , as he _RARE_ which projects he will cut back , which he will advance by increased _RARE_ or new _RARE_ efforts . STO
* No matter how high the hopes and dreams of _RARE_ , budget making _RARE_ them to the cold _RARE_ of dollars and cents . STO
* When the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the _RARE_ budget , to which his faith and credit are committed ; ; its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment . STO
* He cannot , of course , examine each proposal from scratch . STO
* He _RARE_ and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution . STO
* _RARE_ must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship . STO
* Because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money , an institution should choose its fields of _RARE_ . STO
* Otherwise it will be headed for _RARE_ , at worst , and at best towards _RARE_ of other less dramatic but socially and _RARE_ _RARE_ branches of learning . STO
* In the national interest even the _RARE_ universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present _RARE_ to keep up with the _RARE_ in all branches . STO
* _RARE_ activities -- business management , public relations , _RARE_ -- offer _RARE_ one of their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education . STO
* Here the reasonable _RARE_ of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role . STO
* In the areas that do not relate directly to the educational program , expert _RARE_ will serve the college or university better than close _RARE_ attention . STO
* The president should find strong _RARE_ and _RARE_ the _RARE_ discretion to them . STO
* _RARE_ education cannot compete with the salary _RARE_ of the business world , but an educational institution can offer many potent _RARE_ _RARE_ to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income . STO
* Just as the entire faculty should know the _RARE_ educational philosophy and objectives , so should _RARE_ officers . STO
* They will better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of _RARE_ goals . STO
* A president is frequently _RARE_ to serve in _RARE_ civic and governmental _RARE_ , to make speeches to lay groups , and to make numerous _RARE_ _RARE_ on and off campus . STO
* Since he can neither accept nor _RARE_ them all , he must be _RARE_ by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ are better received when he _RARE_ why his obligations to his institution _RARE_ his acceptance . STO
* By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues , the president can develop a _RARE_ of able _RARE_ who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution , something more than the _RARE_ shadow of one man . STO

* Introduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . STO
* The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during _RARE_ ( e.g. , _RARE_ , 1958 ) . STO
* When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and _RARE_ materials of the moon . STO
* _RARE_ of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will _RARE_ the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise _RARE_ information about the characteristics of the solid surface . STO
* Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . STO
* The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about _RARE_ . STO
* This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and _RARE_ components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence . STO
* For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a _RARE_ _RARE_ , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and _RARE_ components . STO
* Of the remaining planets , only Mars and _RARE_ have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available . STO
* Mars has been observed twice at about _RARE_ wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars . STO
* The low intensity of the radiation from _RARE_ has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin . STO
* No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small _RARE_ , or low temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity . STO
* In spite of this , the very large radio _RARE_ and improved _RARE_ techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years . STO
* The study of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at _RARE_ wave length by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1946 ) . STO
* This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the _RARE_ emission of the moon over three lunar _RARE_ by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1949 ) . STO
* They deduced from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a _RARE_ in a roughly _RARE_ fashion ; ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) ; ; and that the maximum of the radio emission came about _RARE_ days after _RARE_ _RARE_ , which is again in contrast to the infrared emission , which reaches its maximum at _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ explained their observations by pointing out that _RARE_ materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially _RARE_ to radio waves , although _RARE_ to infrared radiation . STO
* The infrared emission could then be assumed to _RARE_ at the surface of the moon , while the radio emission _RARE_ at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase . STO
* Since the absorption of radio waves in _RARE_ material varies with wave length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material . STO
* The radio emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1955 ) identified the origin of _RARE_ radio noise on their records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from Jupiter . STO
* This _RARE_ type of planetary radiation is discussed by _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 13 ) and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 14 ) . STO
* _RARE_ radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at _RARE_ and _RARE_ cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at _RARE_ cm in 1956 ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Sloanaker , 1958 , A , B , C ) , and from _RARE_ at _RARE_ cm in 1957 ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1958 ) . STO
* In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from _RARE_ to _RARE_ cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the _RARE_ range from _RARE_ to _RARE_ Aj . STO
* The _RARE_ characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity , the _RARE_ , and the direction of arrival of the waves . STO
* The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc . STO
* This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large _RARE_ now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved . STO
* It should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the _RARE_ of the radio sources by observing with large _RARE_ or with _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth . STO
* There have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the _RARE_ of planetary radiation . STO
* The measurements made with the _RARE_ _RARE_ reflector , which is _RARE_ , would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured _RARE_ of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Recent _RARE_ measurements ( _RARE_ and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the _RARE_ emission of Jupiter to be partially _RARE_ and to _RARE_ in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk . STO
* Other than this very significant result , most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation . STO
* The concept of apparent _RARE_ temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets . STO
* The received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which _RARE_ the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet . STO
* The apparent _RARE_ disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation . STO
* The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really _RARE_ as a black body , will the apparent _RARE_ temperature _RARE_ to the physical temperature of the _RARE_ material . STO
* The radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at _RARE_ wave lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio noise . STO
* The _RARE_ level of _RARE_ _RARE_ solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than _RARE_ . STO
* At _RARE_ wave lengths an increase of the order of _RARE_ in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected . STO
* Therefore , _RARE_ the extreme outbursts , reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause _RARE_ errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ range . STO
* 2 . STO
* The moon _RARE_ observations Radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from _RARE_ mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1 . STO
* _RARE_ have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( _RARE_ , 1955 , 1956 , ; ; see also _RARE_ 11 ) . STO
* Not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of _RARE_ the _RARE_ and _RARE_ , must account for much of the _RARE_ in the measured radio brightness temperatures . STO
* In the observations at _RARE_ mm ( _RARE_ , 1959 ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , _RARE_ , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases . STO
* These observations indicate that the lunar _RARE_ heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the _RARE_ regions . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which _RARE_ it . STO
* These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid _RARE_ in the radio brightness with _RARE_ . STO
* Very recently , observations have been made at _RARE_ wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , 1960 ) . STO
* The _RARE_ contours are much _RARE_ than those observed at _RARE_ mm by _RARE_ ( 1959 ) and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features . STO
* Such _RARE_ observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted . STO
* The observations of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Sloanaker at _RARE_ cm and of Sloanaker at _RARE_ cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described . STO
* _RARE_ at _RARE_ cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 , 1956 , using the _RARE_ reflector at the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington . STO
* The _RARE_ diameter of the antenna beam was about _RARE_ , and the angle _RARE_ by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side _RARE_ . STO
* The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Sloanaker , 1958 ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known . STO
* The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift _RARE_ across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by _RARE_ integration of the antenna _RARE_ _RARE_ , to be _RARE_ . STO
* The measured brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the _RARE_ disk is nearly uniform . STO
* The result of the observations is Af where the phase angle , Q , is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors . STO
* This result is plotted along with the _RARE_ observations of _RARE_ ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , A . STO
* The variation in the _RARE_ emission of the moon during a _RARE_ is very much less than the variation in the _RARE_ emission , as would be expected from the explanation of _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1949 ) . STO
* In the discussion which follows , the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ variation will be called the variable component . STO
* The _RARE_ observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the _RARE_ reflector at the Maryland Point _RARE_ of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory . STO
* The age of the moon was about 2 days . STO
* The _RARE_ diameter of the main _RARE_ of the antenna was about _RARE_ , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a _RARE_ shape for the antenna beam and a _RARE_ bright disk for the moon . STO
* _RARE_ Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a _RARE_ gas ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . STO
* It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately _RARE_ of the total arc energy . STO
* A detailed energy balance of the anode was established . STO
* The anode _RARE_ could be reduced to a negligible amount . STO
* The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the _RARE_ gas was investigated for various arc lengths and _RARE_ between 100 _RARE_ and 200 Aj . STO
* _RARE_ observations were made and _RARE_ motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow _RARE_ . STO
* Introduction The high heat _RARE_ existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs _RARE_ extensive cooling to prevent electrode _RARE_ . STO
* The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode . STO
* In _RARE_ electric arcs , for instance , approximately _RARE_ of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat _RARE_ in excess of Af as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere . STO
* In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode . STO
* The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs . STO
* In plasma generators the _RARE_ forced _RARE_ may _RARE_ the picture somewhat . STO
* The heat transfer to the anode is due to the following effects : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ of condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic energy of the _RARE_ _RARE_ on the anode . STO
* This energy transfer depends on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode _RARE_ . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ transfer by molecular _RARE_ as well as by radiation from the arc column . STO
* The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is _RARE_ by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with _RARE_ up Af . STO
* This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in detail by _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 1 ) . STO
* The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . STO
* Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs _RARE_ those near a _RARE_ point . STO
* It is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode . STO
* The gas flow through a plasma generator will _RARE_ these conditions ; ; however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux . STO
* An attempt to improve the life of the _RARE_ or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss . STO
* The following possibilities exist for achieving this : 1 . STO
* The use of high _RARE_ and low _RARE_ by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces . STO
* 3 . STO
* _RARE_ of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas _RARE_ through the anode . STO
* The third method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for the first time by C. _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 2 ) . STO
* The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a _RARE_ cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ through a porous anode ( _RARE_ cooling ) not only _RARE_ back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also _RARE_ the conditions in the arc itself . STO
* A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper . STO
* _RARE_ was used as a blowing gas to _RARE_ any effects of _RARE_ or chemical reaction . STO
* The anode material was porous graphite . STO
* _RARE_ porous _RARE_ should be usable in principle . STO
* However , technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots . STO
* The experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free burning arcs . STO
* Thus , direct _RARE_ can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( _RARE_ 3 ) . STO
* Experimental apparatus Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and _RARE_ views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder . STO
* The cathode consisted of a _RARE_ '' diameter _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ attached to a water cooled _RARE_ tube . STO
* This tube could be adjusted in its _RARE_ direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode _RARE_ . STO
* The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk . STO
* The _RARE_ gas _RARE_ from the anode formed a jet directed _RARE_ towards the cathode below . STO
* _RARE_ of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two _RARE_ shown in figure 2 . STO
* _RARE_ was also _RARE_ at low _RARE_ ( mass flow rate Af ) through a tube _RARE_ with the cathode as an additional precaution against _RARE_ of the arc by air . STO
* The anode consisted of a 12 inch diameter porous graphite plug , 14 inch long . STO
* The graphite was National _RARE_ _RARE_ 60 , which has a _RARE_ of 50% and an average _RARE_ size of 30 . STO
* This small _RARE_ size was required to _RARE_ uniformity of the flow leaving the anode . STO
* The anode plug ( Figure 2 ) was inserted into a carbon anode holder . STO
* A _RARE_ _RARE_ was used to measure the _RARE_ temperature of the _RARE_ gas . STO
* It was exposed to a high velocity gas jet . STO
* A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts . STO
* This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the _RARE_ by natural _RARE_ . STO
* Two _RARE_ shown in figure 1 and 2 ( _RARE_ _RARE_ Co. _RARE_ _RARE_ ) served for _RARE_ measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder . STO
* Three _RARE_ were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature . STO
* Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 . STO
* In this design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by _RARE_ from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the _RARE_ . STO
* To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the _RARE_ of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air _RARE_ of _RARE_ inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder . STO
* In addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation . STO
* _RARE_ of the shield and of the surface of the _RARE_ anode holder were measured by _RARE_ to account for heat received by the _RARE_ but not _RARE_ from the anode plug . STO
* The _RARE_ flow from commercial bottles was _RARE_ by a pressure _RARE_ and measured with a gas flow _RARE_ . STO
* The power source was a commercial D. C. _RARE_ . STO
* At 100 _RARE_ the _RARE_ cycle _RARE_ was less than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a _RARE_ load . STO
* The current was _RARE_ by means of a variable _RARE_ and measured with a 50 _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The arc voltage was measured with a _RARE_ whose _RARE_ were connected to the anode and cathode _RARE_ . STO
* Because of the falling characteristic of the _RARE_ , no _RARE_ _RARE_ was required for stability of operation . STO
* A high frequency _RARE_ was used to start the arc . STO
* Experimental procedure and error analysis 1 . STO
* _RARE_ cooled anode with carbon anode holder The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind . STO
* The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made . STO
* In order to reduce the number of variable parameters , all experiments were made with a constant arc length of _RARE_ '' and a current of 100 Aj . STO
* The _RARE_ flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between Af and Af . STO
* The lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable . STO
* The upper limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc . STO
* This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously . STO
* For each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured . STO
* To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a _RARE_ . STO
* As it turned out , a very hot region occurred on the plug . STO
* Its temperature was denoted by Af . STO
* The size of this hot region was estimated by eye . STO
* The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug . STO
* The mean temperature of this region was _RARE_ by the temperature measured _RARE_ between the edge of the hot spot and the _RARE_ of the plug . STO
* It was denoted by Af . STO
* The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation : Af where _RARE_ is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot . STO
* _RARE_ thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the gas _RARE_ rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation Af whereby the specific heat of _RARE_ was taken as Af . STO
* This calculation results in an _RARE_ rise which is somewhat high because it _RARE_ a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures . STO
* The _RARE_ gas temperature measured with the _RARE_ shown in figure 2 was Af . STO
* The Af values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements _RARE_ _RARE_ were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 . STO
* Some of these temperatures are plotted in figure 4 . STO
* They showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements . STO
* Thus , the _RARE_ line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates . STO
* The _RARE_ in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of Af . STO
* This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned . STO
* It is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the energy flux _RARE_ from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements . STO
* The reflection of radiation _RARE_ from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry . STO
* The total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts . STO
* It was calculated from the temperature gradient Af at Af inch as Af . STO
* The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby Af . STO
* The temperature distribution of figure 4 gives Af for all blowing rates , assuming Af . STO
* The temperature dependent value of _RARE_ was taken from _RARE_ 7 . STO
* The radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to Af where Af is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures Af and Af calculated _RARE_ to equation ( 1 ) . STO
* A band _RARE_ is shown in Figure 2 . STO
* It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by _RARE_ . STO
* There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or _RARE_ to be tested is placed . STO
* A tape of cellulose _RARE_ is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or _RARE_ with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . STO
* In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . STO
* After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . STO
* By the use of various weights , data for a _RARE_ of shear graph can be obtained . STO
* The instrument used for this work was a slight _RARE_ of that previously described . STO
* In this test a Af tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and _RARE_ at a rate of Af with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' on each side of the tape . STO
* This gives a rate of shear of Af . STO
* This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the _RARE_ was increased by the _RARE_ of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the _RARE_ during the runs . STO
* The face of one block contained a hole _RARE_ '' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure . STO
* Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types . STO
* Two of the fluids showed a _RARE_ normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two . STO
* Figure 3 shows the data on a _RARE_ fluid , labeled _RARE_ _RARE_ which gave a high positive normal pressure . STO
* Although the tape was run for over 1 _RARE_ , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . STO
* A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time . STO
* A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . STO
* By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of _RARE_ ( molecular weight reported to be _RARE_ ) was over half an atmosphere . STO
* The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand . STO
* The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were _RARE_ with molecular weights which were stated to be _RARE_ and 300 . STO
* These are fluids which one would expect to be less _RARE_ or more _RARE_ because of their lower molecular weight . STO
* The maximum _RARE_ was _RARE_ '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids . STO
* It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some _RARE_ factor of the assembly , since different _RARE_ were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and _RARE_ of the apparatus . STO
* This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head Af since this is not sufficient to explain the _RARE_ by several _RARE_ . STO
* These experiments can be considered _RARE_ only . STO
* However , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper . STO
* They also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures . STO
* Such an instrument would be useful for the _RARE_ of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies . STO
* The elasticity is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials . STO
* Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy _RARE_ such as printing _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ plastics , and bread dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length '' , `` _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at present . STO
* The actual change Af caused by a shear field is calculated by _RARE_ the pressure differential times the volume , just as it is for any _RARE_ or _RARE_ pressure head . STO
* If the volume is the _RARE_ volume , then Af is obtained on a _RARE_ basis which is the customary _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* Although the Af calculation is obvious by _RARE_ with that for _RARE_ field and _RARE_ pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects . STO
* Consider a shear field with a height of H and a _RARE_ area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of H ( referred to the same base as H ) and a _RARE_ area of A . STO
* If Af is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and _RARE_ is the density of the fluid , then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is Af . STO
* Af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to H . STO
* The total volume of the system above the reference height is Af , and H can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H . STO
* The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the _RARE_ with respect to H and _RARE_ to zero . STO
* This gives Af , which is the pressure . STO
* This is interesting for it _RARE_ both the _RARE_ concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium . STO
* This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields . STO
* The relation between _RARE_ pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an _RARE_ way . STO
* In the above development we have applied the _RARE_ of equilibrium ( referred to by some as _RARE_ ) to the steady state . STO
* This can be justified _RARE_ in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared . STO
* This has an interesting _RARE_ with the assumption stated by _RARE_ that `` the _RARE_ mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' . STO
* There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar . STO
* If the mechanics are similar , we can also _RARE_ that the _RARE_ will also be similar . STO
* The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference Af and _RARE_ a force normal to the _RARE_ face is compatible with the information obtained from optical _RARE_ studies of fluids undergoing shear . STO
* _RARE_ these _RARE_ studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at _RARE_ to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves _RARE_ toward the direction of shear . STO
* According to _RARE_ , the _RARE_ shear S is given by Af where **yc is the angle of _RARE_ . STO
* From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to _RARE_ the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the Af calculated from the pressure normal to the _RARE_ face . STO
* There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in _RARE_ fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields . STO
* These _RARE_ are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands . STO
* These _RARE_ appear to be _RARE_ , and it is _RARE_ convenient to assume that they are . STO
* If they are not _RARE_ , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation . STO
* The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of course , given by the direction of the major axis of the _RARE_ . STO
* Mason and Taylor both show that the major axis of the _RARE_ is at _RARE_ at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear . STO
* ( Some _RARE_ break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become _RARE_ to it without _RARE_ . STO
* ) This is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by _RARE_ studies . STO
* The relative forces can be calculated from the various _RARE_ of curvature if we assume : ( A ) The surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop . STO
* ( B ) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions . STO
* ( C ) The kinetic effects are negligible . STO
* ( D ) Since the shape of the drop _RARE_ to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid . STO
* These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear . STO
* Just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is Af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is Af , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is Af , where _RARE_ is the interfacial tension and Af and Af are the two _RARE_ of curvature . STO
* This formula is given by _RARE_ and Mason . STO
* If A is the major axis of an _RARE_ and B and C are the other two axes , the radius of curvature in the _RARE_ plane at the end of the axis Af , and the difference in pressure along the A and B axes is Af . STO
* There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas . STO
* However , there are photographs of suspended drops of _RARE_ _RARE_ ( viscosity _RARE_ _RARE_ ) suspended in corn _RARE_ of 71 _RARE_ in a paper by Mason and _RARE_ . STO
* This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of course , not negligible . STO
* _RARE_ on the photograph in this paper give Af at the maximum rate of shear of Af . STO
* If it is assumed that the formula given by _RARE_ of _RARE_ Af applies , the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of _RARE_ of the major axis , and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated . STO
* Its value was Af from the above data . STO
* This appears to be high , as would be expected from the _RARE_ viscosity of the material in the drops . STO
* It is appropriate to call attention to certain _RARE_ properties of an ideal gas that are _RARE_ to _RARE_ deformation . STO
* The internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume . STO
* In other words , if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in _RARE_ it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink . STO
* This means that work _RARE_ Q which in turn _RARE_ Af . STO
* There is a well-known relationship between probability and _RARE_ which states that Af , where _RARE_ is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal gas ) could be reached by chance alone . STO
* This is known as _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ _RARE_ is , in this case , equal to the usual _RARE_ , for there are no other changes or other energies involved . STO
* Note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy , the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure . STO
* The energy for any _RARE_ work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ magnetic resonance study of _RARE_ Af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented . STO
* Af is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening . STO
* The lines are _RARE_ and over the range of field Af _RARE_ and temperature Af the _RARE_ increases with increasing Af and decreasing T . STO
* An _RARE_ resonance shift of Af to lower applied fields indicates a weak _RARE_ _RARE_ contact interaction . STO
* The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Af of a _RARE_ paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Af . STO
* The theory _RARE_ a linear dependence of Af on Af , where J is the experimentally determined _RARE_ constant . STO
* The experimental second moment Af _RARE_ to the relation Af in agreement with theory . STO
* Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) . STO
* The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes . STO
* The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the symmetry of the Af bond in Af remains in doubt . STO
* Introduction the magnetic moment of an _RARE_ electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei . STO
* It is important to consider and experimentally _RARE_ this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure . STO
* Af appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal _RARE_ , with three _RARE_ _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong Af bond provides structural interest . STO
* We first discuss the Af bond in Af . STO
* We then _RARE_ the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic _RARE_ with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment . STO
* Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects . STO
* The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various _RARE_ models of the Af bond in Af . STO
* Af bond in Af _RARE_ studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the Af bond will be linear in the absence of _RARE_ of packing in the solid . STO
* Moreover , it will be _RARE_ until a certain critical Af distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric . STO
* There is ample evidence from many sources that the Af bond in Af is symmetric . STO
* The Af distance in Af is _RARE_ Aj . STO
* There is evidence , though less _RARE_ than for Af , that the Af bond in nickel _RARE_ is symmetric . STO
* Here the Af distance is _RARE_ Aj . STO
* A number of _RARE_ estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the Af bond becomes symmetric when the Af bond length is about _RARE_ to _RARE_ A , but aside from the possible example of nickel _RARE_ there have been no _RARE_ reports of symmetric Af bonds . STO
* Douglass has studied the crystal structure of Af by x-ray diffraction . STO
* He finds the structure contains an Af bond with the Af distance of Af . STO
* There is , then , the possibility that this Af bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data . STO
* Douglass found Af to be _RARE_ , _RARE_ symmetry Af , with Af , Af . STO
* X-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of Af . STO
* The x-ray data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for _RARE_ led him to assume a center of symmetry . STO
* Under this assumption the space group must be Af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell . STO
* Af . STO
* This space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric . STO
* Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for Af . STO
* These data lead to a structure in which sheets of _RARE_ atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms . STO
* The O atoms in each sheet are close packed and each _RARE_ atom is surrounded by a distorted _RARE_ of O atoms . STO
* The Af layers are stacked normal to the ( _RARE_ ) axis with the lower _RARE_ of one layer directly above the upper _RARE_ of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers . STO
* The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds . STO
* A drawing of the structure is to be found in reference 6 . STO
* The gross details of the structure appear reasonable . STO
* The structure appears to be unique among _RARE_ compounds , but is the same as that assumed by Af . STO
* The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal . STO
* However , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off Af , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become _RARE_ , with Af at Af and Af at Af ( space group Af ) , where Af represents the _RARE_ on one side of the Af layers and Af those on the other side . STO
* However , any oxygen _RARE_ would _RARE_ either the already extremely short Af _RARE_ distance of _RARE_ A or the _RARE_ Af _RARE_ _RARE_ which are already quite short at _RARE_ Aj . STO
* Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general , rather than special , positions along the ( _RARE_ ) axis . STO
* If the Af bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet _RARE_ between the oxygen sheets ; ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ; ( 3 ) hydrogen atoms are _RARE_ placed , either _RARE_ or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms . STO
* _RARE_ ( 2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a _RARE_ effect and on general chemical structural grounds . STO
* A _RARE_ of `` _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ '' is more likely than ordered `` _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists . STO
* Therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located _RARE_ ( 1 ) or _RARE_ ( 3 ) . STO
* Experimental procedures samples Douglass prepared his sample of Af by thermal decomposition of aqueous _RARE_ acid at 300 - _RARE_ . STO
* Dr. Douglass was kind enough to _RARE_ us about 5 _RARE_ of his material . STO
* This material proved to be _RARE_ , since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample . STO
* _RARE_ , we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a few percent Af _RARE_ . STO
* Since Af is _RARE_ , we felt that any results obtained from the _RARE_ _RARE_ Af would be suspect . STO
* _RARE_ suggested another preparation of Af which we used here . STO
* _RARE_ ml of _RARE_ aqueous Af with 1 Af added are heated in a bomb at _RARE_ for _RARE_ hours . STO
* A very fine , gray solid ( about 15 _RARE_ ) is formed , _RARE_ by _RARE_ , and dried at _RARE_ ) . STO
* _RARE_ thermal analysis showed a very small _RARE_ reaction at _RARE_ and a large _RARE_ reaction at _RARE_ . STO
* This latter reaction is in _RARE_ with the reported decomposition of Af . STO
* _RARE_ analysis showed a weight loss of _RARE_ centered at _RARE_ and another weight loss of _RARE_ at _RARE_ . STO
* The expected weight loss for Af going to Af and Af is _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ analysis of gases _RARE_ upon heating to _RARE_ indicated nitrogen _RARE_ and water vapor . STO
* The small reaction occurring at _RARE_ is probably caused by decomposition of _RARE_ _RARE_ , and perhaps by a small amount of some _RARE_ material other than Af . STO
* All subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to _RARE_ for one hour . STO
* _RARE_ spectra indicated Af _RARE_ and all other impurities much lower . STO
* _RARE_ analysis gave _RARE_ _RARE_ as compared with _RARE_ theory . STO
* However , Af _RARE_ water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low _RARE_ analysis and high total weight loss . STO
* The x-ray diffraction pattern of the material , taken with _RARE_ radiation , indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass . STO
* _RARE_ analyses by R. G. _RARE_ of this laboratory indicated no _RARE_ impurities . STO
* Af was found to be paramagnetic with three _RARE_ _RARE_ per _RARE_ atom and a molecular _RARE_ of Af , where Af . STO
* For exactly three _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ would be _RARE_ . STO
* An infrared spectrum , obtained by H. A. _RARE_ and R. G. _RARE_ of this laboratory , showed bands in the positions found by Jones . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ examination of the Af sample showed it to be composed of nearly _RARE_ particles about _RARE_ in diameter . STO
* The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the _RARE_ _RARE_ are smaller than this . STO
* The x-ray data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater . STO
* We found no obvious effects due to preferred _RARE_ of the _RARE_ in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron _RARE_ examination . STO
* _RARE_ magnetic resonance ( _RARE_ ) measurements The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by _RARE_ a _RARE_ model Af broad line _RARE_ and the associated _RARE_ _RARE_ system . STO
* One measurement at 40 _RARE_ was obtained with the _RARE_ model Af unit . STO
* A _RARE_ type of bridge was used in the 10 - 16 _RARE_ range . STO
* The _RARE_ power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape _RARE_ by _RARE_ effects . STO
* A _RARE_ frequency of 40 _RARE_ with an amplitude as small as possible , _RARE_ with reasonably good _RARE_ quality , was used . STO
* _RARE_ spectra were obtained in all cases . STO
* The _RARE_ was adjusted to minimize the amount of _RARE_ mode mixed in with the absorption signal . STO
* A single value of the thermal _RARE_ time Af at room temperature was measured by the progressive _RARE_ method . STO
* The value of Af estimated at _RARE_ _RARE_ was Af _RARE_ . STO
* A single measurement of the spin - spin _RARE_ time Af was obtained at 10 _RARE_ by _RARE_ methods . STO
* This measurement was obtained by W. _RARE_ of the University of California , _RARE_ , by observing the _RARE_ of the free _RARE_ _RARE_ signal . STO
* The value derived was 16 _RARE_ . STO
* Field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line , defined as the field about which the first moment is zero . STO
* Second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration . STO
* _RARE_ were applied for _RARE_ broadening , apparatus background , and field shift . STO
* _RARE_ were obtained over the temperature range of _RARE_ - _RARE_ . STO
* For the _RARE_ measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The temperature was maintained to within about Af for the period of time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) . STO
* One sample , which had been exposed to the atmosphere after _RARE_ at _RARE_ , showed the presence of _RARE_ water ( about _RARE_ _RARE_ ) ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared , due to broadening , at low temperature . STO
* The data reported here are either from spectra from which the _RARE_ water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples _RARE_ and sealed off at _RARE_ which contain no _RARE_ water . STO
* The measured powder density of the Af used here was about Af , approximately _RARE_ that of the crystal density ( Af ) . STO
* Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about Af . STO
* _RARE_ were obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular _RARE_ with a _RARE_ ratio of 4 : : 1 . STO
* The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube . STO
* The bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary . STO
* _RARE_ were also obtained from a third sample of Af which had been _RARE_ to three times its original volume with powdered , _RARE_ _RARE_ ( Af ) . STO
* This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above . STO
* _RARE_ gave renewed life to soap products at a time when _RARE_ were a threat though expensive , and these same _RARE_ _RARE_ the decline of soap usage when the _RARE_ between _RARE_ and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and _RARE_ . STO
* The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . STO
* The best known field of application for builders is in _RARE_ , _RARE_ detergent formulations for household use . STO
* These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on _RARE_ , synthetic organic actives ( sodium _RARE_ ) and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium _RARE_ or a mixture of sodium _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* In the household market , there are also _RARE_ detergent formulations based on _RARE_ actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; _RARE_ synthetic _RARE_ with much less builder ; ; and the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ as well as soap _RARE_ and _RARE_ , none of which are now _RARE_ advertised . STO
* A _RARE_ _RARE_ which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is _RARE_ of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high _RARE_ ratio . STO
* _RARE_ cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of _RARE_ products : ( 1 ) the formulations made _RARE_ for machine _RARE_ , and ( 2 ) the _RARE_ cleaners used for walls and _RARE_ . STO
* The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders . STO
* In addition , many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and _RARE_ had their _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ , which is still the major _RARE_ of a number of such products . STO
* Many _RARE_ _RARE_ now also contain _RARE_ . STO
* These hard-surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28 . STO
* The cleaning process _RARE_ or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces . STO
* _RARE_ cleaning involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or surface-active material . STO
* An _RARE_ differentiation between _RARE_ and hard-surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved . STO
* One _RARE_ of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of Af . STO
* In contrast , a metal _RARE_ Af in size would have a magnitude from _RARE_ to a million less . STO
* Even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in _RARE_ , _RARE_ capacity , and chemical reactivity . STO
* Spring used a _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending upon surface _RARE_ . STO
* There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ values , such as _RARE_ or _RARE_ level , perfume content , etc. , the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high . STO
* No matter how they are _RARE_ , a large number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal . STO
* This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation . STO
* A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many _RARE_ ; ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a _RARE_ of `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' and dirty spots -- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash . STO
* Since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of _RARE_ . STO
* Harris has indicated that two devices , the _RARE_ and _RARE_ are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics . STO
* Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use . STO
* The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash . STO
* In this way , numerical values for the relative _RARE_ of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) of the cloth _RARE_ before and after washing . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ is evaluated by washing clean _RARE_ with the dirty ones . STO
* As is the case with the surface-active agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high . STO
* Large numbers of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the _RARE_ over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice . STO
* The problems of hard-surface cleaning are not nearly as complex . STO
* In hard-surface cleaning , the inorganic _RARE_ are more important than the organic active . STO
* Indeed , when the proper inorganic constituents are employed , practically any _RARE_ or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ are important inorganic _RARE_ of hard-surface cleaners . STO
* In addition , the _RARE_ are also used , probably acting more as _RARE_ agents than anything else . STO
* The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers . STO
* _RARE_ chemistry of washing Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their _RARE_ are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an _RARE_ picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces . STO
* The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are _RARE_ _RARE_ in the four major categories given below : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ , which is here defined as _RARE_ material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely _RARE_ divided so as to exhibit _RARE_ properties . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ soils , which are _RARE_ by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ of _RARE_ with _RARE_ organic _RARE_ ) . STO
* 3 . STO
* _RARE_ , which include the wide variety of _RARE_ materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object . STO
* 4 . STO
* _RARE_ soils , which primarily include sticky substances and _RARE_ _RARE_ which _RARE_ to leave a _RARE_ . STO
* The dirt on the soiled objects is _RARE_ held by surface _RARE_ to some extent . STO
* However , a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under the name of Van _RARE_ _RARE_ forces . STO
* This is a _RARE_ complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small _RARE_ particle to _RARE_ with other small _RARE_ particles , or to stick to an _RARE_ surface . STO
* Obviously , if _RARE_ particles bear charges of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the attraction will be _RARE_ and the tendency to _RARE_ will be greatly _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , a charged particle will tend to stick to an _RARE_ surface and vice _RARE_ , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge . STO
* In addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of _RARE_ , including liquid _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , stains , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface . STO
* In most cases , these soils are taken up as _RARE_ through capillary action . STO
* In an essentially static system , an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial _RARE_ of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent . STO
* The washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to _RARE_ the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to _RARE_ off the debris and acts , to some extent , as a _RARE_ and _RARE_ agent . STO
* _RARE_ soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; ; and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as _RARE_ _RARE_ which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove . STO
* Therefore , _RARE_ are used . STO
* The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils . STO
* The other constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains and the _RARE_ sticky or dried soils . STO
* As is well known , detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of _RARE_ high molecular weight and highly _RARE_ molecules which exhibit the property of forming _RARE_ in solution . STO
* _RARE_ investigations of anionic _RARE_ , including the _RARE_ , have shown that there is little polymerization or _RARE_ of the chain _RARE_ below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration . STO
* ( 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration , _RARE_ and some _RARE_ are present . STO
* ( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid _RARE_ or polymerization to give the _RARE_ , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 . STO
* ( 3 ) For _RARE_ , these _RARE_ appear to be roughly spherical _RARE_ in which the _RARE_ tails come together so that the _RARE_ groups ( the _RARE_ ends ) face _RARE_ towards the aqueous continuous phase . STO
* Obviously _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) substances such as _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase . STO
* _RARE_ can _RARE_ and hold a considerable amount of _RARE_ substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately _RARE_ . STO
* Although the matter has not been _RARE_ demonstrated , the available data show that _RARE_ in themselves do not contribute significantly to the _RARE_ process . STO
* _RARE_ to micelle formation is the _RARE_ important ability of detergent actives to _RARE_ at oil - water interfaces in such a manner that the _RARE_ ( or _RARE_ ) end of the _RARE_ is directed towards the aqueous phase and the _RARE_ chain towards the oily phase . STO
* In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become _RARE_ in this manner with an oriented film of _RARE_ . STO
* Then during washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that _RARE_ _RARE_ can _RARE_ themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase . STO
* Obviously , a substance which is _RARE_ or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to _RARE_ this process and effectively push off the greasy soil . STO
* Substances other than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous _RARE_ onto surfaces of other _RARE_ condensed phases . STO
* This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall into the class of _RARE_ . STO
* Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly sorbed at oil - water interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an _RARE_ structure ( see Table _RARE_ on p. _RARE_ ) . STO
* Thus , for aqueous _RARE_ , we can think of the _RARE_ organic active as an _RARE_ or _RARE_ surface-active agent , and of an _RARE_ builder as a _RARE_ or _RARE_ surface-active agent . STO
* From the equilibrium _RARE_ data which are available , it seems logical to expect that _RARE_ ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge . STO
* The charged particles then _RARE_ each other and are also _RARE_ from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions . STO
* The _RARE_ charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase . STO
* This hypothesis is _RARE_ in _RARE_ to the demonstrated action of organic actives in _RARE_ . STO
* It does not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate builders on _RARE_ phenomena which will be discussed later ( see _RARE_ _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) . STO
* The crude picture of the _RARE_ process thus far developed can be represented as : Af . STO
* The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale . STO
* _RARE_ soil must be dispersed and protected against _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ cloth must be protected against the _RARE_ of dispersed soil . STO
* It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent _RARE_ acting alone are severe . STO
* Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` _RARE_ '' properties has gained widespread acceptance . STO
* In the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each _RARE_ of a _RARE_ formulation ; ; and , indeed , there is no more reason to separate the _RARE_ roles of the active , builder , _RARE_ agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous _RARE_ making up a given commercial organic active . STO
* The thermal exchange of chlorine between Af and liquid Af is readily _RARE_ at temperatures in the range of _RARE_ and above . STO
* The photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at _RARE_ using light absorbed only by the Af . STO
* In the gas phase , with Af of Af and Af of Af , quantum _RARE_ of the order of Af have been observed at _RARE_ . STO
* Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure _RARE_ , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction . STO
* It appears possible to set a lower limit of about Af for the activation energy of the _RARE_ of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride _RARE_ by a chlorine atom to form Af radical . STO
* The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical _RARE_ are removed at the walls or by reaction with an _RARE_ rather than by _RARE_ radical combination reactions . STO
* Introduction Because of the _RARE_ of the molecules , _RARE_ exchange reactions between _RARE_ _RARE_ and the corresponding carbon _RARE_ would appear to offer particularly _RARE_ possibilities for obtaining _RARE_ basic kinetic data . STO
* It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free _RARE_ , as well as information on the heat of _RARE_ of the _RARE_ bond . STO
* The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies . STO
* It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic _RARE_ on a vacuum system followed by multiple _RARE_ of the liquid . STO
* It should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any _RARE_ substances by the usual _RARE_ methods followed by _RARE_ prior to addition of radioactive chlorine . STO
* Furthermore , the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for _RARE_ of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; ; also it would be expected that Af would compete very effectively with any impurities as a _RARE_ for Af _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of _RARE_ one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure _RARE_ . STO
* We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their _RARE_ to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for _RARE_ of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride . STO
* Experimental _RARE_ . STO
* -- _RARE_ highest _RARE_ tank chlorine was passed through a tube of _RARE_ Af into an _RARE_ Pyrex system where it was condensed with liquid air . STO
* It was then distilled at least three times from a trap at _RARE_ to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each _RARE_ . STO
* The purified product was stored at _RARE_ in a tube equipped with a break seal . STO
* Of several methods employed for _RARE_ chlorine with _RARE_ , the exchange of inactive chlorine with _RARE_ aluminum _RARE_ at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory . STO
* To prepare the latter , silver _RARE_ was precipitated from a solution containing Af obtained from the _RARE_ _RARE_ National Laboratory . STO
* The silver _RARE_ was _RARE_ under vacuum in the presence of aluminum _RARE_ with the resultant product of Af which was _RARE_ into a flask on the vacuum line . STO
* _RARE_ purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place . STO
* The _RARE_ was stored at _RARE_ in a tube equipped with a break seal . STO
* _RARE_ quantities of _RARE_ , low _RARE_ , _RARE_ grade carbon tetrachloride were _RARE_ with Af and Af and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 _RARE_ _RARE_ lamp at a distance of a few inches . STO
* The mixture was then extracted with _RARE_ and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride was distilled on a _RARE_ column , a _RARE_ center cut being retained which was then _RARE_ under vacuum in the presence of Af . STO
* _RARE_ inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with a break seal . STO
* This _RARE_ tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the flask was _RARE_ onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distilled off . STO
* The required amount of carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line . STO
* The desired amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off . STO
* The contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking , _RARE_ to the reaction tubes , frozen down , and each tube was then sealed off . STO
* The _RARE_ for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a _RARE_ attached to the manifold and then allowed to _RARE_ slowly into the manifold of _RARE_ reaction cells before _RARE_ off . STO
* This method in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of _RARE_ in each of the six cells from a set . STO
* _RARE_ conditions and analysis . STO
* -- The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing _RARE_ mm. _RARE_ and about 15 cm. long . STO
* In a few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. _RARE_ Pyrex tubing of 1 mm. wall thickness . STO
* Both types of tube _RARE_ the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at _RARE_ . STO
* The photochemical reaction cells consisted of 10 mm. _RARE_ Pyrex tubing , _RARE_ cm. long , diffraction effects being _RARE_ by the fact that the light passed through only _RARE_ interfaces and not _RARE_ interfaces . STO
* These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to _RARE_ when _RARE_ frozen carbon tetrachloride . STO
* The round cells were _RARE_ _RARE_ in the light beam which entered the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ through a window . STO
* Two types of light source were used , a thousand _RARE_ _RARE_ lamp and an _RARE_ high pressure _RARE_ arc . STO
* The light was _RARE_ by the soft glass window of the _RARE_ thus _RARE_ that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell . STO
* _RARE_ incident light _RARE_ were measured with a _RARE_ _RARE_ system . STO
* _RARE_ of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell . STO
* Following reaction the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a _RARE_ aqueous sodium iodide solution . STO
* _RARE_ Af was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated ( cells containing _RARE_ _RARE_ were _RARE_ in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide ) . STO
* After _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Af with Af , _RARE_ of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a _RARE_ _RARE_ tube . STO
* In the liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by _RARE_ the tube before opening and _RARE_ the fragments after _RARE_ . STO
* The fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts  minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the counts  minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride , _RARE_ determined _RARE_ being made for the difference in counting efficiency of Af in Af and Af . STO
* Results the thermal reaction . STO
* -- In studying the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold _RARE_ were prepared and analyzed . STO
* Experiments were done at _RARE_ , 200 , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* Following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction _RARE_ prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent , a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be _RARE_ to the method of preparing the chlorine , to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes .

* In addition to the method described in the section above , chlorine and _RARE_ were prepared by the _RARE_ of a Af _RARE_ on the vacuum line , and by exchange of Af with _RARE_ Af . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ was substituted for Af as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride . STO
* No correlation between these variables and the _RARE_ of the results was found . STO
* The reaction rates observed at _RARE_ ranged from Af of the chlorine _RARE_ per hour to _RARE_ _RARE_ per hour . STO
* In most cases the chlorine concentration was about Af . STO
* _RARE_ of reaction tubes containing _RARE_ of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another , both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to _RARE_ of the chlorine _RARE_ per hour . STO
* No detectable reaction was found at room temperature for reaction _RARE_ allowed to stand up to 5 hours . STO
* The liquid phase photochemical reaction . STO
* The liquid phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible than the thermal exchange , although still _RARE_ . STO
* The improvement was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold . STO
* Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold _RARE_ . STO
* Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold _RARE_ were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to _RARE_ in a further _RARE_ to determine the cause of the _RARE_ and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity . STO
* In all cases there was readily _RARE_ exchange after as little as one hour of _RARE_ . STO
* By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature _RARE_ corresponding to activation energies ranging from 11 to 18 Af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases . STO
* It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate _RARE_ based on the differences in the absorption spectra of _RARE_ _RARE_ and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source . STO
* These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at _RARE_ is of the order of magnitude of unity . STO
* When typical reaction cells to which _RARE_ of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and _RARE_ were produced . STO
* Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at Af . STO
* The photochemical exchange in the gas phase . STO
* -- Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate . STO
* Data on such _RARE_ together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table 1 . STO
* , In series 1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from _RARE_ to _RARE_ cm. . STO
* The last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 ( _RARE_ cm. distance ) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity . STO
* Direct _RARE_ of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2 , where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen . STO
* The Poynting-Robertson effect ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ motion of particles by the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ force of the _RARE_ solar radiation , causes the dust to _RARE_ into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . STO
* The _RARE_ velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a _RARE_ particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . STO
* Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the _RARE_ pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . STO
* Further , the _RARE_ radiation , i.e. , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , must _RARE_ away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow _RARE_ in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the _RARE_ force to the _RARE_ force . STO
* The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the _RARE_ axis of orbits to _RARE_ more rapidly than the _RARE_ axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . STO
* Also , planetary _RARE_ attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the _RARE_ as the sun is approached . STO
* At one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . STO
* If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . STO
* De _RARE_ ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more _RARE_ without changing the _RARE_ axis . STO
* This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth . STO
* Since there is a _RARE_ loss of _RARE_ material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a _RARE_ _RARE_ : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from _RARE_ space . STO
* There are several possible sources . STO
* According to Whipple ( 1955 ) , _RARE_ debris is sufficient to _RARE_ the material _RARE_ into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ are also thought to contribute material . STO
* It is also possible that some of the dust in the _RARE_ of the Earth originated from meteoritic _RARE_ upon the moon . STO
* _RARE_ direct measurements of micrometeorite flux One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space . STO
* Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude . STO
* This large discrepancy _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved . STO
* Beyond a few million _RARE_ from the Earth , but still in the region of the Earth's orbit , a _RARE_ of the flux of dust is even more _RARE_ . STO
* At greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain . STO
* There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment . STO
* Direct information has been obtained from _RARE_ and _RARE_ equipped with impact sensors . STO
* In addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of _RARE_ may be _RARE_ to the micrometeorite _RARE_ . STO
* From the brightness of the F component of the solar _RARE_ and the brightness of the _RARE_ light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the _RARE_ plane . STO
* Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of _RARE_ dust for a meteoritic component . STO
* The _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and content of _RARE_ in remote regions are valuable in this category . STO
* The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth . STO
* The direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from _RARE_ sensors ( essentially _RARE_ ) and from wire _RARE_ ; ; these instruments are installed on _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and space _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha ( _RARE_ 1 ) , 1958 _RARE_ 2 ( _RARE_ 3 ) , and 1959 _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 3 ) . STO
* These vehicles , with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure . STO
* Many other vehicles with smaller _RARE_ _RARE_ products contribute some information . STO
* The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for _RARE_ events was Af for particles of mass greater than Af ( _RARE_ , 1960 ) ; ; this mass threshold was derived from the _RARE_ calibration and an assumed impact velocity of Af . STO
* The data show daily and _RARE_ variations . STO
* _RARE_ per cent of the _RARE_ recorded _RARE_ occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude . STO
* One may conclude that most of the detected _RARE_ material is concentrated in _RARE_ streams which intersect the Earth's orbit . STO
* There have been _RARE_ reports from 1958 _RARE_ 2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable . STO
* On May 15 , a very large increase occurred with Af of mass between Af and Af ; ; for the next two days , the impact rate was Af ; ; and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less than Af ( _RARE_ , 1960 ) . STO
* The data for the first day indicate a _RARE_ stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux . STO
* _RARE_ data from 1959 _RARE_ give an average impact rate of Af for masses larger than Af for about 1000 events in a _RARE_ period ( _RARE_ and Alexander , 1960 ) . STO
* The _RARE_ rate varied by less than a factor of _RARE_ . STO
* The data have not yet been analyzed for _RARE_ variations . STO
* Note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux is one fifth as large . STO
* If one _RARE_ that the average flux did not change between measurements , a _RARE_ curve is obtained which _RARE_ the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse 72 power of the radius . STO
* Space _RARE_ have yielded little information . STO
* _RARE_ 1 , recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours . STO
* With _RARE_ sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts , the second and third Russian space _RARE_ indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones . STO
* Being based on so few events , these results are of _RARE_ validity . STO
* The calibration of _RARE_ sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain . STO
* Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results _RARE_ _RARE_ to meteoritic _RARE_ . STO
* However , one must expect that _RARE_ and _RARE_ of material by _RARE_ _RARE_ would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . STO
* In the United States , most of the sensors are _RARE_ by dropping small _RARE_ on their sensitive surfaces . STO
* The Russian _RARE_ claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of _RARE_ material from the _RARE_ . STO
* This `` _RARE_ '' momentum is _RARE_ related to the particle energy . STO
* They _RARE_ about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater . STO
* There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S. _RARE_ are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin . STO
* The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of Af in the U.S. work and Af in the U.S.S.R. work . STO
* The threshold mass of about Af corresponds to a _RARE_ sphere of density Af . STO
* However , the conversion from mass to size is _RARE_ , since many photographic _RARE_ give evidence of a _RARE_ , loosely bound meteorite structure with _RARE_ as low as Af . STO
* To what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown . STO
* The velocity value used is also open to some question ; ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is _RARE_ about the Earth , only about one third the _RARE_ average velocity should be used in _RARE_ the mass . STO
* _RARE_ light and the _RARE_ give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before _RARE_ is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the _RARE_ sensitivity on the incident velocity . STO
* The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by _RARE_ from radar and visual _RARE_ data . STO
* A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table _RARE_ . STO
* From an estimated mass of 25 _RARE_ for a _RARE_ meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of _RARE_ for each unit increase in magnitude . STO
* The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming _RARE_ of density Af except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of _RARE_ pressure . STO
* The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual _RARE_ . STO
* It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of _RARE_ per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant . STO
* The values agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 _RARE_ . STO
* The figures in the _RARE_ column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent shielding by the Earth ; ; hence , these figures apply immediately above the Earth's atmosphere . STO
* The _RARE_ flux is given in the last column ; ; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in _RARE_ space near the Earth . STO
* Of course , if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the _RARE_ in _RARE_ space should be less than the figures given here . STO
* Note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used ; ; for example , _RARE_ ( 1948 ) derived a scale of _RARE_ _RARE_ for a Af , _RARE_ meteorite . STO
* The older _RARE_ were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light . STO
* The mass scale used in Table _RARE_ was derived on the assumption that the motion of the _RARE_ trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , _RARE_ the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) . STO
* A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the _RARE_ magnitude ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1959 ) . STO
* _RARE_ of this relationship through the _RARE_ magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites . STO
* The approximate equation is Af , where N is the number of Af with electron _RARE_ greater than or equal to Af , and Q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite . STO
* Therefore , N is inversely proportional to the radius _RARE_ and in fair agreement with the inverse 72 power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 _RARE_ data . STO
* At the _RARE_ magnitude , Af , and at the _RARE_ magnitude , Af . STO
* These _RARE_ _RARE_ are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the _RARE_ data and the figures in _RARE_ table . STO
* The _RARE_ may be in error for several reasons . STO
* The _RARE_ data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is _RARE_ in the extension into the micrometeorite region . STO
* The _RARE_ and _RARE_ pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and _RARE_ the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns . STO
* Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( _RARE_ , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ indications of micrometeorite flux A measure of the total mass _RARE_ of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of _RARE_ _RARE_ and dust collected in remote regions ( _RARE_ , 1960 ) . STO
* Most meteoritic material , by the time it reaches the Earth's surface , has been reduced to dust or to _RARE_ of _RARE_ material in its passage through the atmosphere . STO
* For all meteorites , the average nickel content is about _RARE_ per cent . STO
* This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial _RARE_ and _RARE_ and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass _RARE_ . STO
* Present data indicate an _RARE_ of about Af tons per year over the entire _RARE_ , or about Af . STO
* Biological warfare Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their _RARE_ products for the purpose of _RARE_ or reducing the military effectiveness of man . STO
* It is the _RARE_ of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems . STO
* Man may also be injured _RARE_ by damage to his food _RARE_ or domestic animals . STO
* Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . STO
* The major reason for this is that it has no _RARE_ effect . STO
* The _RARE_ period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a _RARE_ effect , render this weapon _RARE_ for _RARE_ encounter . STO
* A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the _RARE_ period of most infectious diseases . STO
* Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities . STO
* An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an _RARE_ or cloud of agent over the target area . STO
* This concept has _RARE_ much basic research concerning the behavior of _RARE_ biological materials , the _RARE_ of respiratory _RARE_ , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence . STO
* The biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied _RARE_ during the past fifteen years . STO
* Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to _RARE_ of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics . STO
* Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and _RARE_ techniques . STO
* Much of the older experimental work on respiratory _RARE_ was accomplished by very artificial procedures . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an _RARE_ animal is far different from exposure , through natural _RARE_ , to _RARE_ organisms . STO
* The importance of particle size in such _RARE_ has been thoroughly demonstrated . STO
* The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract , such as the _RARE_ of the nose and the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ and larger _RARE_ , are capable of _RARE_ out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence . STO
* Very small particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these _RARE_ barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs . STO
* This area is highly _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the _RARE_ amounts almost to an _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1 . STO
* In considering BW defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical _RARE_ parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect . STO
* For example , bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air . STO
* There are optimal _RARE_ requirements for various agents when _RARE_ . STO
* Neutral or _RARE_ _RARE_ conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface . STO
* It will rise during _RARE_ conditions . STO
* There are , of course , certain times during the _RARE_ daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met . STO
* Certain other properties of small particles , in addition to those already mentioned in connection with _RARE_ of the respiratory tract , are _RARE_ in defense considerations . STO
* The smaller the particle the further it will travel _RARE_ before settling out . STO
* An aerosol of such small particles , moreover , _RARE_ through structures in much the same manner as a gas . STO
* There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread _RARE_ of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , food stores , _RARE_ , etc. . STO
* _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , there may be _RARE_ in some food or _RARE_ products , i.e. , in milk for example . STO
* The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense . STO
* Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials : In the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat _RARE_ some ten miles off shore under _RARE_ selected _RARE_ conditions . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated . STO
* This material _RARE_ under _RARE_ light which _RARE_ its sampling and assessment . STO
* Four hundred and fifty pounds was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of _RARE_ miles . STO
* Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial . STO
* The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some _RARE_ miles . STO
* From these _RARE_ _RARE_ it can be seen that an area of over _RARE_ square miles was covered . STO
* These _RARE_ could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case . STO
* The behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* An aqueous suspension of the _RARE_ of B. _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , generally known as _RARE_ _RARE_ , was _RARE_ using commercially available _RARE_ . STO
* A satisfactory cloud was produced even though these _RARE_ were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns . STO
* In this test , _RARE_ _RARE_ of a suspension , having a count of Af organisms per ml , or a total of approximately Af _RARE_ , was _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel , _RARE_ two miles _RARE_ and vertical to an _RARE_ breeze . STO
* _RARE_ continued along a _RARE_ course . STO
* This operation was started at _RARE_ p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes . STO
* There was a slight _RARE_ condition , a moderate fog , and 100 per cent relative _RARE_ . STO
* A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore . STO
* These were located at the homes of Government employees , in Government _RARE_ , buildings and _RARE_ within the trial area . STO
* A rough attempt was made to _RARE_ the vertical _RARE_ of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , ninth , and _RARE_ floors of a Government office building . STO
* All _RARE_ were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours . STO
* In this instance , there was a _RARE_ of _RARE_ during the first two hours and a total _RARE_ of _RARE_ for the _RARE_ period , a _RARE_ increase . STO
* This suggests that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased . STO
* As can be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol . STO
* The maximum distance _RARE_ was 23 miles from the source . STO
* As can be seen from these _RARE_ _RARE_ , approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area _RARE_ . STO
* It is quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ in the three levels of the vertical _RARE_ were : Af . STO
* This was not , of course , enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol . STO
* A number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural _RARE_ of entry . STO
* Some agents have been shown to be much more _RARE_ or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to _RARE_ of optimum particle size than by the natural _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , for example , is several _RARE_ more _RARE_ by this route than when given per _RARE_ . STO
* In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult . STO
* In _RARE_ produced by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit fever '' on a finger . STO
* An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious . STO
* _RARE_ that are known to cause frequent _RARE_ among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , etc. , belong in this category . STO
* An agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient _RARE_ and _RARE_ stability to meet realistic minimal _RARE_ requirements . STO
* It is , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property . STO
* In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction . STO
* Moreover , it should not be so _RARE_ in its growth requirements as to make production on a _RARE_ significant scale _RARE_ . STO
* An _RARE_ would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or _RARE_ induced immunity in a target population . STO
* A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be _RARE_ . STO
* It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or _RARE_ immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent . STO
* There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made . STO
* An enemy might choose an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of _RARE_ . STO
* It is possible that certain _RARE_ forms may be produced such as _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ may also be developed with changes in _RARE_ properties that are of importance in identification . STO
* All of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management . STO
* Biological agents are , of course , highly _RARE_ . STO
* They do not destroy physical structures as is true of high _RARE_ . STO
* This may be of _RARE_ importance in considering military objectives . STO
* The question of epidemic disease _RARE_ some discussion . STO
* Only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem . STO
* Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of _RARE_ . STO
* They then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of _RARE_ , it is unlikely that a planned _RARE_ could be _RARE_ . STO
* They argue further ( and somewhat _RARE_ ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an _RARE_ of disease . STO
* This is why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention . STO
* Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target . STO
* This , of course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease . STO
* A hypothetical example will illustrate this point . STO
* Let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the _RARE_ agent of epidemic _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ ) over City A and that a large number of cases of _RARE_ fever resulted _RARE_ . STO
* No epidemic was _RARE_ nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy . STO
* _RARE_ is a _RARE_ for epidemic _RARE_ . STO
* In this case , then , the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack . STO
* This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic . STO
* On the other hand , a similar attack might have been made on City B whose population was known to be lousy . STO
* One might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack . STO
* The major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of _RARE_ military delivery of biological agents from appropriate _RARE_ devices . STO
* It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons . STO
* The same delivery vehicles -- whether they be airplanes , submarines or guided missiles -- should be usable . STO
* If it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city . STO
* Biological agents are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy _RARE_ which _RARE_ many problems in defense . STO
* A few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned . STO
* The air conditioning and _RARE_ systems of large buildings are subject to attack . STO
* America is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed , _RARE_ and even _RARE_ foods . STO
* This is an enormous industry that is subject to _RARE_ . STO
* One must include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products . STO
* _RARE_ industries are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and cosmetics which are _RARE_ to this type of attack . STO
* A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies . STO
* These include _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ , electrophoresis , _RARE_ and column chromatography on ion exchange _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ , using a _RARE_ _RARE_ scheme , _RARE_ whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on _RARE_ _RARE_ cellulose and _RARE_ cellulose . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for _RARE_ from Aj . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ samples . STO
* In the present work whole sera have been _RARE_ by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and certain chemical and _RARE_ properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described . STO
* _RARE_ and methods samples . STO
* _RARE_ samples were obtained from normal group A , group B and group O donors . STO
* Three of the _RARE_ sera used were taken from recently _RARE_ individuals . STO
* One contained complete antibody and had a _RARE_ of 1 : _RARE_ in saline . STO
* The second contained incomplete antibody and showed _RARE_ of 1 : _RARE_ in albumin and 1 : _RARE_ by the indirect Coombs test . STO
* The third , containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies , had _RARE_ of 1 : _RARE_ in saline , 1 : _RARE_ in albumin and 1 : _RARE_ by the indirect Coombs test . STO
* In addition one serum was obtained from a _RARE_ ( R. E. ) who had been _RARE_ 6 years previously . STO
* This serum _RARE_ _RARE_ of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : _RARE_ by the indirect Coombs test . STO
* These antibody _RARE_ were determined by reaction with _RARE_ Af red cells . STO
* _RARE_ technique . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube _RARE_ methods . STO
* One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group Af or group B red cells in a small Af test tube . STO
* In several instances group O cells were also used as controls . STO
* The red cells were used within 2 days after _RARE_ and were washed with large amounts of saline before use . STO
* The _RARE_ of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 Aj . STO
* The tubes were then centrifuged at 1000 _RARE_ for 1 min and examined _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* For the albumin method , equal volumes of _RARE_ _RARE_ albumin , sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 _RARE_ for 1 Aj . STO
* All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods . STO
* The activities of fractions of sera containing Rh antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect Coombs techniques . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ Af cells , Af and _RARE_ and _RARE_ Af cells were used to test each sample ; ; however , in the interest of clarity and _RARE_ only the results obtained with _RARE_ Af and _RARE_ Af cells will be presented here . STO
* The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ABO samples except that the mixture was _RARE_ for 1 hr at _RARE_ before _RARE_ . STO
* The saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner . STO
* The cells were washed three times with saline , _RARE_ serum was added , the cells were _RARE_ , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 _RARE_ for 1 min and examined for _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ sera used were prepared by _RARE_ whole human serum into _RARE_ . STO
* Those _RARE_ shown by _RARE_ to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were selected for use in the present study . STO
* The red cells for the Rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the Af cells , which had been _RARE_ and stored at _RARE_ for approximately 1 year . STO
* These cells were _RARE_ at _RARE_ for 30 min and were _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ and mixing with descending concentrations of _RARE_ solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2% ) . STO
* The cells were then washed three times with saline and _RARE_ to 2% in saline . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Blood samples were allowed to _RARE_ at room temperature for 3 hr , centrifuged and the serum was removed . STO
* The serum was measured _RARE_ and subsequently _RARE_ in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes , approximately _RARE_ ml each , of `` starting buffer '' . STO
* This buffer , pH _RARE_ , was _RARE_ M in Af and _RARE_ M in _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* After dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the _RARE_ placed on a Af cm column of _RARE_ _RARE_ with starting buffer . STO
* The DEAE-cellulose , containing _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ , was prepared in our laboratory by the method of _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100 - _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer , centrifuged , _RARE_ in _RARE_ ml of _RARE_ saline and tested for antibody activity . STO
* The chromatography was done at _RARE_ using gradient _RARE_ , essentially according to _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The deep _RARE_ gradient employed ( fig. 2 ) was obtained with a _RARE_ gradient _RARE_ device ( `` _RARE_ '' , reference ( 8 ) ) and has been described elsewhere . STO
* The other , a shallow _RARE_ gradient ( Fig. 1 ) , was produced with a so-called `` _RARE_ '' apparatus , the `` cone '' being a _RARE_ _RARE_ flask and the `` sphere , '' a _RARE_ _RARE_ flask . STO
* Each initially contained _RARE_ ml of buffer ; ; in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer , _RARE_ M in both Af and _RARE_ , pH _RARE_ . STO
* A flow rate of 72 Af was used and 12 ml fractions were collected . STO
* Approximately _RARE_ fractions were obtained from each column . STO
* These were read at _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ model _RARE_ _RARE_ and tested for antibody activity as described above . STO
* _RARE_ electrophoresis . STO
* For protein identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by _RARE_ against a stream of air at _RARE_ or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted _RARE_ concentration of the protein and dialysis against _RARE_ saline . STO
* During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at _RARE_ by surrounding the apparatus with ice . STO
* Because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very _RARE_ solutions and was a _RARE_ procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments . STO
* _RARE_ electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a _RARE_ model R cell using _RARE_ buffer , pH _RARE_ , _RARE_ strength _RARE_ , at room temperature on _RARE_ _RARE_ filter paper . STO
* Five _RARE_ were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with _RARE_ blue and _RARE_ was carried out using a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* When paper electrophoresis was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a _RARE_ fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were _RARE_ under the conditions described above . STO
* At the end of the run , the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried , stained for 1 hr , washed and dried , while the other strips were maintained in a horizontal position at _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut _RARE_ so as to separate the various protein bands . STO
* The strip sections containing a given protein were _RARE_ , _RARE_ with 0.5 ml of _RARE_ saline , and the _RARE_ were tested for antibody activity . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ from the column which were to be subjected to _RARE_ _RARE_ were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and _RARE_ for 16 hr in the cold against at least _RARE_ volumes of _RARE_ saline , pH _RARE_ , _RARE_ strength _RARE_ . STO
* They were then centrifuged at _RARE_ _RARE_ for 35 to 80 min at _RARE_ in a _RARE_ model E _RARE_ at a protein concentration of _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ were computed as Af values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the _RARE_ patterns . STO
* For _RARE_ _RARE_ , fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less , transferred to cellulose tubes and _RARE_ to 12 ml with _RARE_ saline . STO
* _RARE_ was then carried out in a _RARE_ model L _RARE_ at _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ to _RARE_ min , refrigeration being used throughout the run . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ fractions were then drawn off with a _RARE_ _RARE_ , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for agglutinin activity . STO
* Other methods will be described below . STO
* Experimental and results The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood group of the _RARE_ . STO
* With either of the gradients described , chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated _RARE_ of the ABO series into at least three regions ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) : one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity . STO
* These have been labeled Regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig. 1 . STO
* When the early part of the gradient was _RARE_ , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` _RARE_ '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P. J. and R. S. , Fig. 1 and E. M. , Fig. 2 ) . STO
* The latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak ( Region _RARE_ ) between Regions 1 and 2 . STO
* In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig. 1 ) . STO
* Moreover , after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region _RARE_ _RARE_ ( donors P. J. , D. A. , and J. F. , Fig. 1 ) . STO
* Not all these regions _RARE_ equal _RARE_ activity , as evidenced by _RARE_ and the extent of the active areas . STO
* In all cases , most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity . STO
* This was particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all . STO
* There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of _RARE_ and _RARE_ activity in group O serum , though in two group O donors ( J. F. and E. M. ) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) . STO
* Several samples of _RARE_ plasma were _RARE_ in our laboratory by Method 6 of _RARE_ et al . STO
* These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity , using fractions from group _RARE_ plasma as a control . STO
* As expected , most of the activity was found in _RARE_ Af , with slight activity seen in _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A sample of _RARE_ Af from group O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer , _RARE_ against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 . STO
* Once again , both _RARE_ and _RARE_ activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis . STO
* Similarly , both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , having extremely low , low , and high anionic binding capacity , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) . STO
* _RARE_ of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide . STO
* The incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the _RARE_ ; ; the complete , in the latter part . STO
* The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions ( Fig. 1 ) . STO
* In all cases the activity against Af cells was spread over a wider area than that with Af cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect Coombs ) used for comparison . STO
* The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity . STO
* In fact _RARE_ of Af cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing `` only '' incomplete antibody activity . STO
* This was later known to be the result of _RARE_ the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; ; when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detected . STO
* _RARE_ from the _RARE_ , practically all bees and bumblebees _RARE_ in a state of _RARE_ . STO
* Occasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over _RARE_ in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . STO
* They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often _RARE_ _RARE_ you may very well mistake them for _RARE_ of dirt . STO
* I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have _RARE_ in the previous summer or autumn . STO
* It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , brothers , and _RARE_ sisters ) have _RARE_ with the arrival of the cold weather . STO
* Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . STO
* The _RARE_ emerge on some nice , _RARE_ day in March or April , when the temperature is close to _RARE_ and there is not too much wind . STO
* Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful _RARE_ _RARE_ such as the red _RARE_ _RARE_ of our Pacific Northwest , or otherwise a good _RARE_ tree , or perhaps some nice pussy willow in _RARE_ , preferably one with male or _RARE_ catkins . STO
* The _RARE_ of _RARE_ and of the willow and _RARE_ are the places where large numbers of our early insects will _RARE_ : _RARE_ , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of _RARE_ . STO
* It is a happy , buzzing crowd . STO
* Each male willow _RARE_ is composed of a large number of small flowers . STO
* It is not difficult to see that the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , _RARE_ little scale . STO
* By _RARE_ the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny _RARE_ . STO
* Those are the _RARE_ or honey _RARE_ ( Fig. 26 , page _RARE_ ) . STO
* The _RARE_ willow catkins , then , provide their visitors with both _RARE_ and pollen ; ; a marvelous arrangement , for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed . STO
* The only exception to this is certain bees that have become _RARE_ . STO
* I will deal with these later on . STO
* Quite often , _RARE_ form a majority on the willow catkins . STO
* As we have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , _RARE_ , and much more _RARE_ than _RARE_ , exhibiting various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange . STO
* Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them _RARE_ . STO
* There must be several dozen species in the United States alone . STO
* If you really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North American species is _RARE_ And Their _RARE_ by O. E. _RARE_ . STO
* If we manage to keep track of a _RARE_ queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the _RARE_ little _RARE_ which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep . STO
* As _RARE_ a queen , a _RARE_ female is rather _RARE_ and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable _RARE_ place . STO
* Most species seem to prefer a _RARE_ hollow such as a deserted mouse nest , a bird house , or the hole made by a _RARE_ ; ; some show a definite liking for making their nest in _RARE_ . STO
* Once she has made up her mind , the queen starts out by _RARE_ , in her chosen _RARE_ , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some _RARE_ material . STO
* On this , she _RARE_ an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous _RARE_ mixture called beebread . STO
* She also _RARE_ one or two _RARE_ cups which she _RARE_ with honey . STO
* Then , a group of eggs is deposited in a _RARE_ in the beebread _RARE_ and the egg compartment is closed . STO
* The queen afterward keeps _RARE_ and guarding her eggs like a mother hen , taking a _RARE_ from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey _RARE_ . STO
* When the larvae hatch , they feed on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother . STO
* She continues to add to the pollen supply as needed . STO
* The larvae , kept warm by the queen , are full grown in about ten days . STO
* Each now makes a tough , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* After another two weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small _RARE_ that begin to play the role of worker bees , collecting pollen and _RARE_ in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen _RARE_ to a life of egg laying . STO
* The first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs ; ; males and _RARE_ females do not emerge until later in the season . STO
* The _RARE_ of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed . STO
* By the middle of the summer , many of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queens begin to appear . STO
* _RARE_ , males or _RARE_ are produced , mostly from the _RARE_ eggs of workers , although a few may be produced by the queen . STO
* The young queens and _RARE_ leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the _RARE_ young queens will begin to dig in for the winter . STO
* It is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing , for instance , in August . STO
* The temperature then is still very high . STO
* At the old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the _RARE_ eggs that will produce females . STO
* As a result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die out completely . STO
* The nest itself , the structure that in some cases _RARE_ about _RARE_ individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the _RARE_ larvae of certain _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Not always , though , does the development of a _RARE_ colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described . STO
* Some members of the bee family have become _RARE_ , social _RARE_ that live at the expense of their _RARE_ relatives . STO
* _RARE_ can thus suffer severely from the _RARE_ of Psithyrus , the `` _RARE_ '' as it is called in some European countries . STO
* _RARE_ individuals of Psithyrus look _RARE_ like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they _RARE_ . STO
* The one sure way to tell victim and _RARE_ apart is to examine the _RARE_ legs which in the case of the _RARE_ , Psithyrus , lack the pollen _RARE_ -- naturally ! STO
* The female _RARE_ _RARE_ much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host . STO
* When she _RARE_ , she usually _RARE_ to slip in _RARE_ , to _RARE_ an egg on a completed _RARE_ of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment . STO
* The _RARE_ never seem to recognize that something is _RARE_ , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally . STO
* Thus , the larvae of the _RARE_ can develop at the expense of the _RARE_ inhabitants and the store of beebread . STO
* Later on , they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the _RARE_ workers . STO
* _RARE_ still , in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female _RARE_ the _RARE_ queen . STO
* But let us return , after this _RARE_ _RARE_ , to our willow catkins in the spring ; ; there are other wild bees that command our attention . STO
* It is almost certain that some of these , usually a trifle smaller than the _RARE_ , are _RARE_ or mining bees . STO
* There are about 200 different kinds of Andrena in Europe alone . STO
* One of my _RARE_ is A. _RARE_ , a species very common in England , where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee . STO
* The females like to _RARE_ in the short _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , where their little _RARE_ of earth often appear by the hundreds . STO
* Almost equal in size to a _RARE_ , A. _RARE_ is much more beautiful in color , at least in the female of the species : a rich , _RARE_ , rusty red . STO
* The males are much _RARE_ . STO
* After having _RARE_ , an Andrena female _RARE_ a hole straight down into the ground , forming a _RARE_ about the size of a lead pencil . STO
* The bottom part of a _RARE_ has a number of side _RARE_ or `` cells '' , each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread . STO
* The development of the Andrena larvae is very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already _RARE_ and become adults . STO
* But they are still enclosed in their _RARE_ cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter . STO
* Their appearance , next spring , _RARE_ in an almost _RARE_ way with the _RARE_ of their host plants . STO
* In the _RARE_ valley in California , for instance , it has been observed that there was not one day's difference between the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ and the opening of the willow catkins . STO
* This must be due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal . STO
* After the male and female _RARE_ have _RARE_ , the cycle is repeated . STO
* Although Andrena is _RARE_ , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of _RARE_ together , we must still call it a solitary bee . STO
* Its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species . STO
* After all , social life in the group of the bees is by no means general , although it certainly is a striking feature . STO
* On the basis of its life history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees . STO
* The way in which it _RARE_ its pollen is not so perfect , either . STO
* It _RARE_ pollen _RARE_ and _RARE_ only a large number of long , _RARE_ hairs on its legs , on which the pollen _RARE_ will collect . STO
* Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind . STO
* _RARE_ related to the _RARE_ are the _RARE_ or _RARE_ bees . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great _RARE_ , for example , in _RARE_ and central Washington . STO
* In the United States Department of _RARE_ _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George E. _RARE_ _RARE_ a site in _RARE_ which was estimated to contain _RARE_ _RARE_ females . STO
* Often the _RARE_ are only an inch or two apart , and the bee cities cover several acres . STO
* The life history of the _RARE_ bee is similar to that of Andrena , but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer , and the individuals _RARE_ in the _RARE_ stage . STO
* In most places , there are two generations a year , a second brood of adults _RARE_ late in the summer . STO
* I must _RARE_ guilty to a special sympathy for _RARE_ . STO
* This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington , but certainly I love to visit their _RARE_ cities near _RARE_ and _RARE_ in July or August , when the bees are in their most active period . STO
* The name `` _RARE_ bee '' indicates that one has to look for them in rather _RARE_ places . STO
* Sometimes , although by no means always , these are indeed _RARE_ . STO
* The thing is that these bees love a _RARE_ soil that is moist ; ; yet the water in the ground should not be _RARE_ either . STO
* They dislike dense _RARE_ . STO
* Where does one find such conditions ? STO
* The best chance , of course , is offered by gently _RARE_ _RARE_ where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high _RARE_ leaves _RARE_ _RARE_ which permit only _RARE_ plant growth . STO
* Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . STO
* _RARE_ M. _RARE_ put length at maturity at two _RARE_ the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. _RARE_ data on _RARE_ _RARE_ and ribbon snakes ( _RARE_ ) show that the smallest _RARE_ females are more than half as long as the _RARE_ adults . STO
* Felix _RARE_ states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its _RARE_ length '' , but goes on to _RARE_ the _RARE_ python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . STO
* It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after _RARE_ maturity ; ; he was working with species of _RARE_ , so perhaps some _RARE_ snakes are unusual in this respect . STO
* Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to _RARE_ conditions . STO
* Additional records of slow growth have been omitted . STO
* It is possible to make a few _RARE_ about the six giants themselves . STO
* There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) . STO
* Data on the former are _RARE_ , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby _RARE_ support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length . STO
* For four of the six ( the anaconda and the _RARE_ python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage . STO
* Let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda . STO
* If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a _RARE_ of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet . STO
* When it comes to rate of early growth , the Indian python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years , more or less . STO
* The African rock python , a close second , is followed in turn by the _RARE_ python . STO
* There are few data on the boa constrictor , those for the anaconda are _RARE_ , and there is nothing at all on the _RARE_ python . STO
* It seems likely that the Indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently ; ; it _RARE_ _RARE_ well to _RARE_ and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep . STO
* I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; ; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet . STO
* Until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to _RARE_ from drawing conclusions . STO
* It is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an _RARE_ . STO
* The best way to determine the correct figure ( in _RARE_ ) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth , a method that produced surprising results : _RARE_ of a male Indian python in less than two years , his mate in less than three ; ; data on the boa constrictor about match this . STO
* Another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity . STO
* Results from this approach _RARE_ confirm the direct observations : about three years are required , there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required . STO
* Only the _RARE_ python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or _RARE_ of data . STO
* The following information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less than a _RARE_ maximum ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature . STO
* _RARE_ , in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States , could supply data on the _RARE_ period for only three species in addition to the _RARE_ , which I shall consider separately . STO
* These three were much alike : lined snake ( _RARE_ ) , one year and nine months ; ; _RARE_ snake ( _RARE_ ) , two years ; ; _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , two years . STO
* _RARE_ investigated the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found . STO
* He concluded that in the southern species , which are rapidly growing types , females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three . STO
* Other _RARE_ have _RARE_ that in the northern United States the _RARE_ _RARE_ may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old , and that the young may be born every other year , rather than annually . STO
* _RARE_ study showed that female common _RARE_ and ribbon snakes of _RARE_ mature at about the age of two . STO
* _RARE_ length _RARE_ _RARE_ are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to _RARE_ dimensions . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ are of little value ; ; every snake hide is _RARE_ longer than its _RARE_ and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* In spite of all the _RARE_ , there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants . STO
* The anaconda proves to be the fly in the _RARE_ , but the reason for this is not clear ; ; the relatively wild conditions still found in _RARE_ South America might be responsible . STO
* There are three levels on which to treat the subject . STO
* The first is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof and therefore may _RARE_ on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh . STO
* This approach _RARE_ virtually all field measurements . STO
* The next level attempts to _RARE_ varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; ; field measurements by experienced _RARE_ are not rejected , and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated . STO
* The third level _RARE_ on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire . STO
* The argument against this last approach is comparable to that which _RARE_ stories about _RARE_ snakes , about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again , or even of _RARE_ that _RARE_ people out of _RARE_ ; ; the mere _RARE_ up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of _RARE_ snakes , joint snakes , or _RARE_ .

* _RARE_ has recently used the _RARE_ approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions : the anaconda reaches a length of at least _RARE_ feet , the _RARE_ python _RARE_ , the African rock python 25 , the _RARE_ python at least 22 , the Indian python 20 , and the boa constrictor _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ also treats of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda . STO
* He reasons that as _RARE_ 30 feet long are often found , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous _RARE_ '' over 50 . STO
* He _RARE_ dimensions of 70 feet and more . STO
* His _RARE_ chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge _RARE_ with _RARE_ strength , but these seem to be given to complete his picture , not to be believed . STO
* _RARE_ information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows . STO
* _RARE_ of the six giants _RARE_ of the giants one by one will include , as far as possible , data on these aspects of growth : size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; ; time required to reach maturity ; ; rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage ; ; and maximum length , with confirmation or _RARE_ of _RARE_ figures . STO
* _RARE_ information on the growth of _RARE_ individuals is lacking . STO
* _RARE_ : At birth , this species varies considerably in size . STO
* A brood of _RARE_ born at _RARE_ _RARE_ , near Chicago , ranged in length from 22 to _RARE_ inches and averaged 29 inches . STO
* Lawrence E. _RARE_ gives measurements of nineteen young _RARE_ , presumably members of a brood , from `` South America '' ; ; the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the _RARE_ brood and its average . STO
* Raymond L. _RARE_ had two _RARE_ that averaged _RARE_ inches . STO
* R. R. _RARE_ and F. W. _RARE_ give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* William _RARE_ reports 26 inches and _RARE_ _RARE_ ( this snake must have been _RARE_ ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British _RARE_ . STO
* In contrast , _RARE_ recorded the average length of _RARE_ young of a _RARE_ female as 38 inches , and four young were born in London at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ had a _RARE_ anaconda that weighed only _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A difference between _RARE_ might explain the great range in size . STO
* I have little information on the _RARE_ rate of growth . STO
* Hans _RARE_ had one that increased from _RARE_ inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years , and J. J. _RARE_ records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years . STO
* It is very unlikely that either of these _RARE_ was growing at a normal rate . STO
* In 1948 , _RARE_ Do _RARE_ , the noted _RARE_ _RARE_ , wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes . STO
* He concluded that the _RARE_ maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters , which would approximate from _RARE_ to 42 feet ( 14 meters is slightly less than _RARE_ feet ) . STO
* Thus , his estimate lies between _RARE_ suggestion of at least _RARE_ feet and the _RARE_ `` monstrous _RARE_ '' _RARE_ by _RARE_ . STO
* The most _RARE_ recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Company , and reported in 1944 by _RARE_ R. _RARE_ . STO
* However , as a field measurement , it is open to question . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable . STO
* However , many _RARE_ remain _RARE_ and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet . STO
* It is possible that especially large _RARE_ will prove to belong to _RARE_ limited to a small area . STO
* In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ constrictor : A _RARE_ _RARE_ brood of sixteen boa _RARE_ born in the _RARE_ Island _RARE_ averaged 20 inches . STO
* This birth length seems to be typical . STO
* When some _RARE_ records of newly and recently born individuals are _RARE_ , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected . STO
* The range is from 14 to 25 inches ; ; the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a Central American female ( see chapter on _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly born individual . STO
* However , as so many of the records are not certainly based on _RARE_ snakes , these data must be taken _RARE_ ; ; final conclusions will have to await the measurements of _RARE_ from definite _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ R. _RARE_ measurements of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at birth the female is slightly larger than the male . STO
* I have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity . STO
* Carl _RARE_ has written to me of sexual activity in February _RARE_ of young born in March _RARE_ . STO
* One female , collected on an island off the coast of _RARE_ , was _RARE_ and measured 4 feet 8 inches from _RARE_ to vent ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long ) . STO
* The female from Central America which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long . STO
* What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; ; unfortunately , no one has kept complete records of one individual , whereas many have been made for a very short period of time . STO
* The results are too varied to allow _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . STO
* The pulmonary vein , however , without the _RARE_ supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . STO
* Another marked difference is noted here . STO
* The pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory _RARE_ , the alveolar _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . STO
* The bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply . STO
* It does , as in type 1 , , supply the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the _RARE_ , and the bronchioles -- _RARE_ in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory _RARE_ . STO
* No bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group . STO
* _RARE_ type 3 ( ( fig. 3 ) is to some degree a composite of types 1 , and 2 . STO
* It is characterized by the presence of _RARE_ developed secondary _RARE_ ; ; well defined , but _RARE_ arranged , interlobular septa and a thick , remarkably _RARE_ pleura ( fig. 9 ) . STO
* The most distal _RARE_ are similar to those found in type 1 , , being composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchioles ( figs. 14 , 15 ) . STO
* In this instance , because of incomplete _RARE_ , the secondary _RARE_ does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1 . STO
* _RARE_ from one area to another are , therefore , _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other , as in type 1 ( ( fig. 24 ) . STO
* This relationship , however , is not maintained _RARE_ . STO
* Here the pulmonary vein , as in type 2 , , is noted to draw away from the _RARE_ , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum ( figs. 23 , 24 ) . STO
* The bronchial artery in its course and distribution _RARE_ somewhat from that found in other _RARE_ . STO
* As seen in types 1 , and 2 , , it supplies the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ to the pulmonary artery and vein , the _RARE_ and the terminal bronchioles . STO
* As in type 1 , , it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa , and an extremely rich _RARE_ pleural supply is seen ( figs. 9 , 10 ) . STO
* This pleural supply is derived both from _RARE_ and interlobular bronchial artery branches . STO
* Such a _RARE_ _RARE_ was strikingly demonstrated during the _RARE_ process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once . STO
* Some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct _RARE_ branches following along the pleural surface . STO
* With completion of filling , _RARE_ anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches . STO
* An unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted . STO
* This was _RARE_ for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery . STO
* The diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere _RARE_ _RARE_ ( figs. 16 , 23 , 24 ) . STO
* In distal regions its diameter would be _RARE_ to _RARE_ that of the pulmonary artery . STO
* This vessel could be followed to the _RARE_ where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary bed ( figs. 17 , 18 ) . STO
* Also three other direct _RARE_ of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; ; through the interlobular septa ; ; and along the terminal _RARE_ ( figs. 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 ) . STO
* One bronchial _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ was noted at the terminal _RARE_ level ( fig. 26 ) . STO
* _RARE_ It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an _RARE_ comparison is made . STO
* The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding _RARE_ differences been determined . STO
* However , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , from _RARE_ considerations alone , may _RARE_ be different in the monkey than in the horse . STO
* The volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse . STO
* Also , interlobular air _RARE_ may be all but _RARE_ in the cow ; ; probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; ; and , in contrast , are present to a relatively immense degree on a _RARE_ basis in the dog where _RARE_ are absent ( Van _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) . STO
* A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary _RARE_ is entirely lacking at present . STO
* Within certain wide limits anatomy _RARE_ function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as well . STO
* For example , the marked _RARE_ of the monkey to respiratory _RARE_ might be related to its delicate , long alveolar _RARE_ and short , large bronchioles situated within a _RARE_ entirely lacking in _RARE_ supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types 1 , and 3 . STO
* One might also wonder if _RARE_ are capable of developing _RARE_ as we know it in man or the horse . STO
* In addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized _RARE_ occurring in a cow , considering its marked _RARE_ development but , _RARE_ , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog . STO
* _RARE_ , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , _RARE_ as this can be _RARE_ from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) in the human being . STO
* The only area in which one might find major _RARE_ in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries . STO
* As early as _RARE_ , _RARE_ Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings . STO
* In 1951 , this was _RARE_ by _RARE_ . STO
* The opposition to this point of view has its _RARE_ support in the work of Miller ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* Apparently , however , Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been _RARE_ for using _RARE_ human material in his normal study ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) . STO
* Although Miller noted in _RARE_ that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the _RARE_ features of various mammalian lungs other than in the dog and cat ( Miller , _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ ) . STO
* The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear . STO
* However , this artery is known to be a _RARE_ vessel with a distribution primarily to the _RARE_ _RARE_ and supportive tissues of the lung . STO
* The _RARE_ and respiratory bronchioles are primarily _RARE_ tissues . STO
* _RARE_ , they are capable of _RARE_ their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) . STO
* Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the _RARE_ requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily _RARE_ in nature , in the region of the _RARE_ . STO
* If this be true , the possibility exists that an _RARE_ _RARE_ of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread _RARE_ of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized _RARE_ . STO
* One would not expect such an event to occur in animals _RARE_ lungs of types 1 , or 2 . STO
* The presence of normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first noted in _RARE_ by _RARE_ , and thereafter by many others . STO
* _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and Watson ( _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) have all claimed their normal but relatively _RARE_ existence in the human being . STO
* Miller ( _RARE_ ) is the principal _RARE_ of this _RARE_ . STO
* In criticism of the _RARE_ views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung _RARE_ studies in which all of the _RARE_ channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were _RARE_ with various _RARE_ colored particles designed to stop at the _RARE_ level . STO
* As early as 1913 _RARE_ and _RARE_ demonstrated with _RARE_ studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ in 1931 and _RARE_ in 1958 _RARE_ this . STO
* Our own studies in which bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by _RARE_ the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein , and then by _RARE_ the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards . STO
* It is distinctly possible , therefore , that _RARE_ pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts _RARE_ and hence , _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ is further supported by _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) demonstration of _RARE_ bronchial artery and _RARE_ muscular coats which are capable of acting as _RARE_ . STO
* In other words , the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts . STO
* In addition , little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses . STO
* _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ ) found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) also were unable to find them in _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by _RARE_ or _RARE_ methods , in dogs . STO
* The possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is _RARE_ is therefore _RARE_ . STO
* Certainly , the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species . STO
* It is , however , highly _RARE_ and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species , especially the dog . STO
* In conclusion , these findings suggest the need for a comparative _RARE_ , pathology , and _RARE_ of mammalian lungs . STO
* In addition , a detailed _RARE_ survey of the _RARE_ of generalized pulmonary _RARE_ in _RARE_ would be interesting and pertinent . STO
* Also , for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man . STO
* This is especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in view of their marked anatomical differences from man . STO
* Finally , it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be _RARE_ more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species . STO
* Summary The main _RARE_ anatomical features of the lungs of various _RARE_ are presented . STO
* A _RARE_ of these features permits the lungs to be _RARE_ into three _RARE_ _RARE_ types . STO
* _RARE_ 1 , is represented by the cow , sheep , and pig ; ; type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; ; type 3 , , by the horse . STO
* _RARE_ is extremely well developed in type 1 ; ; absent in type 2 ; ; _RARE_ developed in type 3 . STO
* The pleura and interlobular septa are thick in types 1 and 3 . STO
* The pleura is extremely thin in type 2 and septa are absent . STO
* _RARE_ supply to the pleura in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery , and in type 2 , by the pulmonary artery . STO
* In types 1 , 2 and 3 the bronchial artery _RARE_ in a capillary bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal _RARE_ . STO
* In type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed . STO
* _RARE_ terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal _RARE_ in types 1 and 3 , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present . STO
* Well developed respiratory bronchioles , on the other hand , appear to be the only form taken by the distal _RARE_ in type 2 . STO
* In type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the _RARE_ and the pulmonary artery from the _RARE_ to the hilum . STO
* This may be due to the heavy interlobular _RARE_ tissue barriers present . STO
* In type 3 , this general relationship is maintained _RARE_ but not _RARE_ where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2 . STO
* Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . STO
* First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . STO
* In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are _RARE_ and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . STO
* The _RARE_ Chart for each sex _RARE_ clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of _RARE_ and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of _RARE_ . STO
* Second , for both sexes , the 21 _RARE_ lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . STO
* Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to _RARE_ early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . STO
* Third , the process of _RARE_ is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which _RARE_ data for other groups of children . STO
* The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . STO
* It is convenient to _RARE_ a child's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( _RARE_ ) , or `` delayed '' according to whether the child's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short _RARE_ line . STO
* When a dot appears close to the end of the _RARE_ line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical _RARE_ _RARE_ the mean age . STO
* Such _RARE_ may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , _RARE_ `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean . STO
* In the lower portion of each Chart , the Skeletal Age ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified . STO
* There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the _RARE_ _RARE_ boys and girls . STO
* The upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation , and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation . STO
* Thus , a child's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve . STO
* To _RARE_ the purpose of the Skeletal _RARE_ Chart : each contains two kinds of _RARE_ maturity norms which show two quite different methods of _RARE_ developmental level of growth centers . STO
* First , the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting of those from Hand , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* The lower portion _RARE_ only films of Hand . STO
* Second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round bones of the five regions . STO
* The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly , since only two long bones are included in Hand and _RARE_ as a region . STO
* Third , the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level , Onset and Completion . STO
* The lower portion _RARE_ the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset and Completion . STO
* Fourth , the two indicators are for the most part widely separated _RARE_ , with the extensive age _RARE_ occurring during childhood for all but one growth center . STO
* The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Onsets , _RARE_ , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile . STO
* It may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . STO
* Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age _RARE_ are dependent upon Onsets during _RARE_ and upon _RARE_ during _RARE_ . STO
* It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . STO
* Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ as well as Hand , it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of _RARE_ developmental progress during childhood . STO
* As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and _RARE_ -- particularly the former -- provide a different tool or indicator of _RARE_ in _RARE_ development , each within a limited age period . STO
* Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of _RARE_ specific periods of delay in _RARE_ developmental progress . STO
* It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of _RARE_ of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 . STO
* As one approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have be constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 . STO
* The differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into _RARE_ by means of a series of arrows . STO
* The data for boy 34 appear in Figure 3 , and for girl 2 in Figure 4 . STO
* The _RARE_ system used in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers . STO
* The `` dot '' on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center . STO
* The `` tip '' of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center . STO
* Thus , the _RARE_ of the `` dots '' and `` tips '' , respectively , indicate individual _RARE_ of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls . STO
* The direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at Completion from the level at Onset . STO
* When the `` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification used in this paper is `` Same schedule '' . STO
* The length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at Completion over that at Onset , and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables . STO
* The difference between the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes _RARE_ the _RARE_ sequence in Figures 3 and 4 . STO
* This difference is readily _RARE_ by referring to Table 1 . STO
* For example , arrow 17 in Figure 3 _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ epiphysis for boy 34 , whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is _RARE_ by arrow 18 in Figure 4 . STO
* For the boy , this epiphysis was _RARE_ delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion . STO
* Thus , the _RARE_ of its ossification was _RARE_ and the _RARE_ ability to `` catch up '' in ossification is demonstrated . STO
* In contrast , for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset and delayed at Completion . STO
* Obviously , the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between Onset and Completion . STO
* The Skeletal Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the _RARE_ period . STO
* _RARE_ of the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in Table 1 . STO
* We have attempted to simplify the extensive task of _RARE_ onset ages and completion ages of each child -- more than _RARE_ values for the entire group -- by _RARE_ figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center . STO
* Figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of _RARE_ the results for each growth center . STO
* _RARE_ other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this _RARE_ have been included in the Appendix . STO
* The principles used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix . STO
* One growth center in a short bone -- distal _RARE_ of the second finger -- was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because _RARE_ fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones , occurs in this center for girls near the _RARE_ and for boys near their comparable _RARE_ stage . STO
* Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , _RARE_ patterns , and health during _RARE_ . STO
* The following summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of _RARE_ the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center . STO
* At the top of Figure 5 , for example , the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in Table 1 . STO
* The 34 arrows , _RARE_ onset age plus completion age _RARE_ , have been _RARE_ in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls . STO
* The growth center depicted here , in the distal _RARE_ of the second finger , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones . STO
* The mean onset age was _RARE_ months ( Table 1 ) , and the average _RARE_ of the _RARE_ stage was _RARE_ months . STO
* The correlation ( Table 2 ) between onset age and completion age was _RARE_ , and that between onset age and _RARE_ was _RARE_ . STO
* With due consideration for the limits of precision in assessing , expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years , and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the _RARE_ , each arrow with a `` shaft length '' of four months or less was selected as indicating `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion , for this particular epiphysis . STO
* Accordingly , girls 31 , 29 , _RARE_ , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , _RARE_ , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion . STO
* It seems clear , from the _RARE_ shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and _RARE_ for the 34 girls . STO
* Accordingly , if _RARE_ fusion occurs in this _RARE_ near _RARE_ , early and late _RARE_ might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule '' . STO
* As an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion . STO
* It is of interest that her _RARE_ was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group . STO
* A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would _RARE_ quite a different conclusion about the _RARE_ value of onset age in forecasting their _RARE_ of the _RARE_ stage . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion ; ; thus early forecasting of the _RARE_ stage would appear possible for only seven boys . STO
* _RARE_ 34 , like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; ; his arrow _RARE_ the line _RARE_ the mean . STO
* The `` dot '' on his arrow indicates early Onset and the `` tip '' indicates relatively later Completion . STO
* After the 42 figures had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6 , _RARE_ of the onset ages and completion ages were summarized from them . STO
* _RARE_ enough , the effect of the _RARE_ _RARE_ is _RARE_ by a high concentration of potassium in the _RARE_ medium and is _RARE_ by the absence of potassium ( _RARE_ , 1960 ) . STO
* B . STO
* _RARE_ of iodine The precise mechanism for _RARE_ of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . STO
* However , the formation of _RARE_ bound iodine , mainly _RARE_ , can be accomplished in _RARE_ systems . STO
* In the absence of additions to the _RARE_ , the product formed is an iodinated _RARE_ protein ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1953 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1955 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , 1956 ; ; _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1958 ; ; De _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1960 ) . STO
* This _RARE_ does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in _RARE_ by _RARE_ systems . STO
* In addition , the _RARE_ acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . STO
* If _RARE_ and a system generating hydrogen _RARE_ are added to a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the thyroid , large quantities of free _RARE_ can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . STO
* It is not clear whether this system bears any _RARE_ to the in _RARE_ _RARE_ mechanism , and a system generating _RARE_ has not been identified in thyroid tissue . STO
* On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Af and then to Af as the active _RARE_ species . STO
* In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are iodinated and that free _RARE_ and _RARE_ are not iodinated . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone . STO
* The _RARE_ and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form _RARE_ and thyroxine . STO
* The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with _RARE_ systems in _RARE_ and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine _RARE_ ( _RARE_ and James , 1958 ) . STO
* There is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under _RARE_ control . STO
* The chemical nature of the _RARE_ is discussed below ( _RARE_ _RARE_ et _RARE_ ) . STO
* C . STO
* _RARE_ synthesis Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin . STO
* Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in _RARE_ systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in _RARE_ been _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of _RARE_ , for in certain _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in _RARE_ experiments ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1959 ) . STO
* Similar findings have been noted in a patient with _RARE_ absence of the _RARE_ enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide . STO
* In addition , depending on availability of _RARE_ iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine . STO
* D . STO
* _RARE_ Since the _RARE_ thyroid _RARE_ are the _RARE_ _RARE_ thyroxine and _RARE_ ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before _RARE_ . STO
* The presence of several _RARE_ and _RARE_ has been demonstrated in the thyroid . STO
* One of the _RARE_ has pH optimum of about _RARE_ and another of about _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , Stanley and _RARE_ , 1954 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1955 ) . STO
* The finding that the concentration of one of these _RARE_ is increased in thyroid _RARE_ from _RARE_ animals suggests that this _RARE_ may be active in _RARE_ . STO
* There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the _RARE_ has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known . STO
* A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not _RARE_ released and that the _RARE_ proceeds _RARE_ with the formation of _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1956 ) . STO
* Besides _RARE_ enzymes the thyroid _RARE_ _RARE_ enzymes . STO
* A _RARE_ _RARE_ with a pH optimum of around 8 , and requiring reduced _RARE_ _RARE_ for activity , has been identified in the thyroid ( _RARE_ , 1957 ) . STO
* This _RARE_ _RARE_ is effective against _RARE_ and di-iodotyrosine , but does not _RARE_ thyroxine or _RARE_ . STO
* It is assumed that the iodine released from the _RARE_ remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid , where it is _RARE_ and _RARE_ into thyroglobulin . STO
* The thyroxine and _RARE_ released by _RARE_ and so _RARE_ _RARE_ presumably _RARE_ into the blood stream . STO
* It has been shown that thyroglobulin _RARE_ thyroxine , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong . STO
* It has been suggested that the plasma _RARE_ proteins , which have an extremely high _RARE_ for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1957 ) . STO
* E . STO
* _RARE_ drugs _RARE_ drugs are of two general types . STO
* One type has a small _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ type . STO
* This ion _RARE_ thyroid hormone synthesis by _RARE_ with iodide concentration in the thyroid . STO
* It does not appear to affect the _RARE_ mechanism as such . STO
* The other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is _RARE_ by _RARE_ . STO
* These drugs have no effect on the iodide _RARE_ mechanism , but they inhibit _RARE_ . STO
* The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the _RARE_ form of iodine before it can _RARE_ thyroglobulin ( _RARE_ , 1954 ) . STO
* On the other hand , there are a few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as _RARE_ , _RARE_ no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine . STO
* Any of the antithyroid drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause _RARE_ , _RARE_ to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis , with production of _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ of the pituitary then _RARE_ by an increased output of TSH , causing the thyroid to _RARE_ . STO
* The effect of drugs that act on the _RARE_ mechanism can be _RARE_ by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet . STO
* The antithyroid drugs of the _RARE_ type , however , are not _RARE_ by such means . STO
* Besides those of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ types , certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods . STO
* The most conclusively identified is _RARE_ , which was isolated from _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , 1950 ) . STO
* It is presumed to occur in other members of the _RARE_ family . STO
* There is some evidence that naturally occurring _RARE_ may play a role in the development of _RARE_ , particularly in _RARE_ and Australia ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1956 ) . STO
* There it seems that the _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active _RARE_ , which is then _RARE_ in the milk . STO
* F . STO
* _RARE_ influences Besides the presence of _RARE_ in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid gland . STO
* In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in _RARE_ iodine causes thyroid _RARE_ , _RARE_ and increased thyroid activity ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1952 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ , 1954 ) . STO
* In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of _RARE_ is about 100 _RARE_ per day . STO
* With lower levels , thyroid _RARE_ and increased thyroid _RARE_ enable the thyroid to _RARE_ a larger proportion of the daily _RARE_ of iodine . STO
* Further , the gland is able to _RARE_ a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* In the presence of a low iodine _RARE_ , thyroglobulin _RARE_ in _RARE_ with Af is found to contain more _RARE_ than normal , the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and _RARE_ being _RARE_ reduced . STO
* This appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid _RARE_ of newly iodinated thyroglobulin . STO
* If the deficiency _RARE_ long enough , it is reasonable to suppose that the Af label will reflect the Af distribution in the thyroglobulin . STO
* Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide _RARE_ , or _RARE_ , or _RARE_ thyroglobulin _RARE_ . STO
* B . STO
* The _RARE_ hormone The name _RARE_ hormone ( TSH ) has been given to a substance found in the _RARE_ pituitary gland of all species of animal so tested for its presence . STO
* The hormone has also been called _RARE_ or _RARE_ hormone . STO
* At the present time we do not know by what _RARE_ mechanism TSH acts on the thyroid , but for _RARE_ of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the _RARE_ cells and increase in the _RARE_ uptake of Af . STO
* Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood . STO
* Brown ( 1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of _RARE_ TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject . STO
* 1 . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ and physical properties of pituitary _RARE_ As long ago as _RARE_ it was pointed out by _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid . STO
* This connection was _RARE_ by Smith and Smith ( _RARE_ ) , who showed that saline _RARE_ of fresh _RARE_ pituitary _RARE_ could _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The first attempts to _RARE_ TSH came a decade later , when _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1931 ) used _RARE_ acid to separate the _RARE_ TSH from insoluble impurities . STO
* After their work other investigators applied _RARE_ techniques to the problem , as well as _RARE_ with organic _RARE_ , such as _RARE_ . STO
* Albert ( 1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period , from 1931 to 1945 , were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material . STO
* Much of this work has been reviewed by White ( 1944 ) and by Albert ( 1949 ) . STO
* _RARE_ up to about 1957 have been discussed by _RARE_ ( 1958 ) . STO
* In the last few years , the application of _RARE_ and other modern techniques to the problem of _RARE_ TSH has led to further _RARE_ ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1960 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1960 ) . STO
* The most active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in _RARE_ , composition and physical properties . STO
* Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood . STO
* First , is the _RARE_ form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is _RARE_ and stored ? STO
* Second , what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration _RARE_ from the normal level and in which direction ? STO
* It is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary TSH if the _RARE_ chemical information about blood TSH is to be discussed _RARE_ . STO
* The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is _RARE_ by the recent observation that there exists an _RARE_ _RARE_ TSH in blood drawn from many _RARE_ patients ( Adams , 1958 ) . STO
* Whether this _RARE_ TSH _RARE_ _RARE_ from pituitary TSH , or is , _RARE_ , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood _RARE_ , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary Aj . STO
* In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine _RARE_ the _RARE_ methods used to obtain them . STO
* The introduction of the United States _RARE_ reference standard in 1952 and the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the _RARE_ and international units of _RARE_ activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time . STO
* We should like to _RARE_ the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the _RARE_ of biological units . STO
* For the most part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard . STO
* A . STO
* Standard preparations and units of _RARE_ activity The international unit ( _RARE_ ) , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different _RARE_ ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in _RARE_ mg of the International Standard Preparation . STO
* The international unit is _RARE_ with the _RARE_ unit adopted in 1952 , which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the _RARE_ reference substance . STO
* Introduction _RARE_ weakness is now recognized as an _RARE_ though serious _RARE_ of _RARE_ therapy , with most of the synthetic _RARE_ _RARE_ in clinical use . STO
* Although _RARE_ have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of _RARE_ weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which _RARE_ _RARE_ the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . STO
* The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed _RARE_ muscular weakness while receiving a variety of _RARE_ for a _RARE_ anemia . STO
* Report of case This patient was a _RARE_ white male _RARE_ who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of _RARE_ weakness and general _RARE_ . STO
* In 1953 the patient developed an _RARE_ anemia for which 15 blood _RARE_ were given over a period of 4 years . STO
* _RARE_ was first noted in 1956 , and a _RARE_ marrow _RARE_ at that time showed `` scattered _RARE_ of fibrosis '' _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* No additional _RARE_ were necessary after the institution of _RARE_ in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with _RARE_ _RARE_ to 10 mg. daily . STO
* This _RARE_ was continued until February , 1958 . STO
* In February , 1958 , the patient suffered a _RARE_ _RARE_ complicated by pulmonary _RARE_ . STO
* Additional findings at this time included _RARE_ , peripheral _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ was _RARE_ gm. . STO
* _RARE_ included _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Later , _RARE_ and salt restriction became necessary to control the _RARE_ of chronic _RARE_ failure . STO
* Because of increasing anemia , _RARE_ , 8 mg. daily , was started on _RARE_ 23 , 1958 , and was continued until July , 1958 . STO
* In September , 1958 , the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which was concurrent with _RARE_ of his anemia ; ; the _RARE_ was _RARE_ gm. . STO
* In an attempt to reverse the _RARE_ trend by _RARE_ the bone marrow and controlling any _RARE_ component , _RARE_ , 16 mg. daily , was begun on _RARE_ 26 , 1958 , and continued until _RARE_ 18 , 1959 . STO
* At first the patient felt stronger , and the _RARE_ rose to _RARE_ gm. , but on _RARE_ 20 , 1958 , he complained of `` _RARE_ in '' in his knees . STO
* By _RARE_ 8 , 1958 , weakness , specifically involving the _RARE_ and thigh _RARE_ , was pronounced , and a common _RARE_ was `` difficulty in _RARE_ up on to _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ , 30 mg. daily , was substituted for _RARE_ from _RARE_ 22 until _RARE_ 1 , 1958 , without any improvement in the weakness . STO
* _RARE_ potassium at this time was _RARE_ _RARE_ per _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ was _RARE_ gm. By _RARE_ 1 , 1958 , the weakness in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ muscle groups was appreciably worse , and it became difficult for the patient to rise _RARE_ from a sitting or _RARE_ position . STO
* _RARE_ , 16 mg. daily , was resumed and maintained until _RARE_ 18 , 1959 . STO
* _RARE_ was omitted for a _RARE_ period , but there was no change in the muscle weakness . STO
* At this time a detailed _RARE_ examination revealed _RARE_ muscle _RARE_ that was moderate in the hands and feet , but marked in the shoulders , hips , and _RARE_ _RARE_ , with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* No _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ were found . STO
* _RARE_ revealed no evidence of lower motor _RARE_ disease . STO
* _RARE_ function tests yielded normal results . STO
* The _RARE_ iodine was _RARE_ mg. , and the radioactive iodine uptake over the thyroid gland was _RARE_ in 24 hours , with a conversion ratio of _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ test demonstrated normal absorption of _RARE_ Af . STO
* In February , 1959 , during the second admission to The New York Hospital , a _RARE_ specimen of the left _RARE_ showed striking increase in the _RARE_ _RARE_ nuclei and _RARE_ muscle fibers in several sections . STO
* _RARE_ serum potassium levels remained normal ; ; the serum _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ was 10 units per _RARE_ per _RARE_ . STO
* The clinical impression at this time was either muscular _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* On _RARE_ 12 , 1959 , purified _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ ) , 20 units daily _RARE_ , was started but had to be discontinued 3 weeks later because of excessive fluid retention . STO
* From March 3 to May 1 , 1949 , the patient was maintained on _RARE_ , 3 to 6 mg. daily . STO
* In May 1959 , _RARE_ , 30 mg. daily , replaced the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ weakness did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then _RARE_ . STO
* In spite of normal thyroid function tests , a trial of _RARE_ , _RARE_ mg. daily for one week , was given but served only to _RARE_ muscle weakness . STO
* _RARE_ attempts to withdraw _RARE_ entirely were _RARE_ because increased muscle weakness resulted , as well as fever , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , anxiety , and an _RARE_ of the anemia . STO
* These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ back pain in June , 1959 , _RARE_ a third hospital admission . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ with partial _RARE_ of _RARE_ was found . STO
* A _RARE_ diet , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ failed to change the _RARE_ _RARE_ or the severe muscle weakness . STO
* The terminal hospital admission on June _RARE_ , 1959 , was necessitated by continued weakness and _RARE_ complicated by _RARE_ retention and painful _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* X-ray films of the _RARE_ column showed _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* On July 4 , 1959 , the patient developed marked _RARE_ pain and _RARE_ , went into shock , and died . STO
* _RARE_ at _RARE_ The body was that of a _RARE_ , somewhat _RARE_ white man _RARE_ _RARE_ lb. . STO
* There were _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the mouth was _RARE_ . STO
* The heart weighed _RARE_ gm. , and at the _RARE_ _RARE_ the left and right _RARE_ measured 19 and 3 mm. , respectively . STO
* The _RARE_ arteries were _RARE_ and _RARE_ narrowed throughout their courses , and the right _RARE_ artery was virtually _RARE_ by a yellow _RARE_ _RARE_ 1.5 cm. distal to its origin . STO
* The _RARE_ of the posterior base of the left _RARE_ was replaced by gray scar tissue over a _RARE_ cm. area . STO
* The _RARE_ were normal except for thin yellow _RARE_ on the _RARE_ surface of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Microscopically , sections from the posterior base of the left _RARE_ of the heart showed several large areas of replacement of muscle by _RARE_ tissue . STO
* In addition , other sections contained focal areas of recent _RARE_ _RARE_ that were _RARE_ with neutrophils . STO
* Many of the _RARE_ fibers were _RARE_ and had large , irregular , _RARE_ nuclei . STO
* The _RARE_ of the larger _RARE_ arteries was _RARE_ by _RARE_ tissue containing _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ cells . STO
* The _RARE_ surface of the _RARE_ was covered with _RARE_ , _RARE_ , hard , _RARE_ _RARE_ along its entire course , and there was a marked _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of the large major _RARE_ arteries . STO
* In particular , the _RARE_ of the right _RARE_ and _RARE_ arteries were virtually _RARE_ , and both _RARE_ common _RARE_ arteries were completely _RARE_ . STO
* The lungs weighed together _RARE_ gm. . STO
* On the surfaces of both lungs there were _RARE_ _RARE_ measuring up to 3 cm. in diameter . STO
* The _RARE_ was slightly _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of the left lung , and there were several firm , gray , _RARE_ _RARE_ measuring as large as 3 mm. . STO
* Microscopically , there was _RARE_ , fibrosis , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ laden with brown pigment were seen in some of the _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ of some of the small arteries was _RARE_ by _RARE_ tissue . STO
* The firm red _RARE_ weighed _RARE_ gm. , and its surface was _RARE_ by discrete , small patches of white material . STO
* The _RARE_ cells _RARE_ the _RARE_ were prominent , and many contained large quantities of _RARE_ . STO
* Some of the _RARE_ contained large numbers of _RARE_ red cells , and cells of the _RARE_ series were found in small numbers . STO
* There were slight fibrosis and marked _RARE_ . STO
* The liver weighed _RARE_ gm. , was brown in color , and the cut surface was _RARE_ by irregular pale areas . STO
* Microscopically , there was _RARE_ of the central veins , and there was some _RARE_ of adjacent _RARE_ . STO
* Some liver cord cells contained _RARE_ _RARE_ , while others had small amounts of brown _RARE_ pigment . STO
* The _RARE_ contained about 40 _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and 3 smooth , _RARE_ _RARE_ measuring up to 1 cm. in diameter . STO
* The mucosa of the stomach was _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ over a 14 cm. area . STO
* The small and large _RARE_ were filled with gas , and the _RARE_ was _RARE_ to about 2 times its normal _RARE_ . STO
* The small _RARE_ and _RARE_ contained approximately 300 _RARE_ of _RARE_ , _RARE_ material , and the mucosa throughout was _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A careful search failed to show _RARE_ of any of the _RARE_ vessels . STO
* Microscopically , the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive _RARE_ and contained large numbers of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ was _RARE_ _RARE_ with neutrophils . STO
* The mucosa of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ showed similar changes , and in some areas the _RARE_ was _RARE_ and contained considerable numbers of neutrophils . STO
* Some of the small vessels were filled with _RARE_ _RARE_ , and there was extensive _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A section of the _RARE_ revealed intense _RARE_ and extensive focal _RARE_ of the mucosa , associated with much _RARE_ and many neutrophils . STO
* _RARE_ taken from the _RARE_ yielded _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ were pale and weighed right , _RARE_ gm. , and left , _RARE_ gm. . STO
* The surfaces were _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ by clear , _RARE_ _RARE_ measuring up to 3 cm. in diameter . STO
* On the surface of the right _RARE_ there were also 2 yellow , firm , _RARE_ raised areas measuring up to 2 cm. in diameter . STO
* Microscopically , both _RARE_ showed many small _RARE_ scars in which there was _RARE_ and _RARE_ fibrosis , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and an infiltration of _RARE_ and plasma cells . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ contained _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ with neutrophils . STO
* Throughout , there were marked _RARE_ and _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* These changes were more marked in the _RARE_ right _RARE_ than in the left . STO
* In addition , there were 2 small _RARE_ _RARE_ in the right _RARE_ . STO
* The bone of the _RARE_ bodies , ribs , and _RARE_ was soft and was easily compressed . STO
* The marrow of the _RARE_ bodies was pale and showed areas of _RARE_ replacement . STO
* Microscopically , there were many areas of _RARE_ _RARE_ with areas of _RARE_ . STO
* The cells of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ series were normal except for their numbers . STO
* There was no evidence of fibrosis . STO
* The muscles of the _RARE_ , chest wall , neck , and _RARE_ wall were soft , pale , and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ studies of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ major , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and diaphragm showed _RARE_ as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from swelling and _RARE_ to focal _RARE_ of the muscle fibers . STO
* These changes were most marked in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ and less evident in the _RARE_ , diaphragm , and _RARE_ . STO
* In the _RARE_ and _RARE_ there were many swollen and _RARE_ _RARE_ fibers such as that shown in Figure 2 . STO
* Such swollen fibers were deeply _RARE_ , contained a few _RARE_ nuclei , and showed loss of _RARE_ , _RARE_ of _RARE_ , and prominent _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ often involved only a portion of the length of a given fiber , and usually the immediately adjacent fibers were normal . STO
* As shown in Figure 3 , the _RARE_ of other fibers was pale , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ and _RARE_ by _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ cells were strikingly absent . STO
* In association with these changes in the fibers , there were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei . STO
* These were increased both in number and in size , contained prominent _RARE_ , and were distributed throughout the fiber ( Figs. 2 - 5 ) . STO
* In contrast to the nuclear changes described above , another change in muscle nuclei was seen , usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The nuclei of these fibers , as is shown in Figures 3 and 4 , showed remarkable _RARE_ and were closely _RARE_ , forming a _RARE_ structure at either the center or the _RARE_ of the fiber . STO
* _RARE_ nuclei were usually _RARE_ to round , though occasionally _RARE_ , and frequently small and somewhat _RARE_ . STO
* At times , _RARE_ of 10 to 15 _RARE_ nuclei were also observed . STO
* Occasionally there were small _RARE_ fibers that were _RARE_ of _RARE_ and contained many _RARE_ nuclei with prominent _RARE_ ( Fig. 5 ) . STO
* These were thought to represent _RARE_ fibers . STO
* _RARE_ stains failed to show fibrosis in the involved muscles . STO
* In all of the sections examined , the _RARE_ and small arteries were essentially normal . STO
* _RARE_ of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the _RARE_ _RARE_ used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with _RARE_ insoluble _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by _RARE_ _RARE_ ( E. F. Smith & _RARE_ ) on sweet clover stems . STO
* ( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . STO
* The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Af in Af to give a nearly neutral _RARE_ and precipitated by _RARE_ _RARE_ with Af . STO
* The _RARE_ was washed twice with an _RARE_ _RARE_ solution of Af , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , _RARE_ against cold distilled water till free from _RARE_ ions , and _RARE_ using liquid nitrogen . STO
* ( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of _RARE_ _RARE_ as recommended by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1957 ) . STO
* ( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) cellulose column _RARE_ with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Af potassium phosphate and Af . STO
* Preparation of frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by _RARE_ et al ( 1951 ) . STO
* _RARE_ and stem tumors from sweet clover plants _RARE_ with WTV were _RARE_ in liquid nitrogen , _RARE_ in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 _RARE_ in a _RARE_ maintained at _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* The sections were mounted on cold _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ adhesive ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) in earlier experiments , and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1959 ) . STO
* The latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory . STO
* The sections were then _RARE_ by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a _RARE_ for 30 minutes ; ; until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks . STO
* _RARE_ technique indirect method . STO
* The sections were fixed in _RARE_ for 15 minutes and dried at _RARE_ for 30 minutes . STO
* Some of them were then covered with a drop of Af in a moist chamber at _RARE_ for 30 - 40 minutes . STO
* As controls other sections were similarly covered with Aj . STO
* Sections were then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes . STO
* After _RARE_ out most of the saline around the sections , a drop of Af was _RARE_ over each of the sections , allowed to react for 30 minutes , and then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes . STO
* After _RARE_ out most of the liquid around the sections , the latter were mounted in _RARE_ _RARE_ ( 7 parts _RARE_ to 3 parts of PBS ) . STO
* Direct method . STO
* After drying the sections under the _RARE_ , fixing in _RARE_ , and drying at _RARE_ as in the indirect method , the sections were treated with conjugated Af or Af ( _RARE_ unless mentioned otherwise ) for 5 - 30 minutes . STO
* As controls , other sections were similarly treated with Af or conjugated _RARE_ to the New York strain of _RARE_ _RARE_ virus ( _RARE_ and Black , 1956 ) . STO
* The sections were then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes and mounted in _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ sections were examined under dark field _RARE_ in a _RARE_ fluorescence _RARE_ equipped with a _RARE_ vapor lamp ( _RARE_ _RARE_ 200 ) . STO
* The light beam from the lamp was _RARE_ through a _RARE_ thickness _RARE_ _RARE_ filter . STO
* In the _RARE_ a _RARE_ 2 B filter was used to filter off _RARE_ _RARE_ light . STO
* A red filter , _RARE_ barrier filter with the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ _RARE_ 23 , was also used in the _RARE_ lens assembly as it improved the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence . STO
* Results specificity of staining indirect method . STO
* In the first few experiments Af was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder . STO
* The intermediate sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder . STO
* Sections of sweet clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1 : 10 solution of Af for 30 minutes , washed in _RARE_ saline for 15 minutes , stained with Af for 30 minutes , and washed for 15 minutes in Aj . STO
* Such sections showed bright _RARE_ specific fluorescence in the cells of the pseudophloem tissue ( Lee and Black , 1955 ) . STO
* This specific fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in _RARE_ sections stained with 1 : 10 dilution of NS and Af or with Af alone . STO
* _RARE_ sections mounted in _RARE_ _RARE_ or sections treated only with NS or Af did not show such green fluorescence . STO
* Sections of crown gall tissue similarly stained with either Af and Af or NS and Af also showed only the light green nonspecific fluorescence . STO
* However , the nonspecific staining by the Af in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of WTV antigen . STO
* Two _RARE_ of Af with _RARE_ _RARE_ or two _RARE_ of Af ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) , NS and Af with crown gall tissue powder , or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining . STO
* _RARE_ of all the sera with sweet clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence , especially when the treated conjugate was _RARE_ to 1 : 2 with _RARE_ saline . STO
* In all the above procedures , when the intermediate sera were _RARE_ to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with _RARE_ saline , the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduced , whereas , a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1 : _RARE_ or _RARE_ the Af to 1 : 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence . STO
* _RARE_ the sections with PBS before _RARE_ the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction . STO
* In addition to other treatments , treating the sections with normal sheep serum for half an hour before _RARE_ Af did not reduce nonspecific staining . STO
* The only treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the conjugate through a DEAE-cellulose column . STO
* When 1 ml of conjugate was passed through a column ( Af ) , the first and second _RARE_ fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments , and very little in others . STO
* In the latter cases an additional treatment of the _RARE_ Af with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder further improved the specificity . STO
* After these treatments the conjugate did not _RARE_ healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which was easily _RARE_ from the bright _RARE_ specific staining . STO
* With this purified conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections with 1 : 10 dilution of Af for 30 minutes , washing with PBS for 15 minutes , staining with Af for 30 minutes , and washing with PBS for 15 minutes . STO
* The specificity of staining in WTV tumors with Af and Af but not with NS and Af or with _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ virus and Af , and the absence of such staining in crown gall tumor tissue from _RARE_ , indicate that an antigen of WTV was being stained . STO
* Direct method . STO
* Af was first conjugated with 50 mg of _RARE_ per _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* This conjugate was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue _RARE_ in the same manner as described for the indirect method . STO
* In all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still present although it was still _RARE_ from specific fluorescence . STO
* In later experiments , Af and Af were prepared by _RARE_ 8 mg of _RARE_ per _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* These conjugates Af had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate ( with 50 mg _RARE_ per _RARE_ of _RARE_ ) while the specific staining was similar in both cases . STO
* _RARE_ staining could be satisfactorily eliminated by passing these conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column as described for Af . STO
* The best staining procedure with this purified Af consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30 minutes and washing in PBS for 15 minutes . STO
* The specificity of staining with Af was established as follows : Af specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover . STO
* Sections of tumors _RARE_ by WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum or conjugated _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ virus . STO
* After passing Af through DEAE-cellulose , the _RARE_ of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was 1 : 4 of the _RARE_ before such passage ( _RARE_ ring tests by R. F. _RARE_ ) ; ; but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining . STO
* This indicates that increase in specificity of Af after passing it through DEAE-cellulose was not merely due to dilution . STO
* _RARE_ staining by DEAE-cellulose treated Af and Af , although clearly _RARE_ under the _RARE_ from either nonspecific staining or _RARE_ of cells , was not satisfactorily _RARE_ to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color _RARE_ . STO
* This was chiefly because of the _RARE_ white _RARE_ from the cells . STO
* The _RARE_ from the walls of the _RARE_ cells was particularly brilliant . STO
* _RARE_ of virus antigen Results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the _RARE_ of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors . STO
* The virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue . STO
* _RARE_ a few isolated _RARE_ cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the _RARE_ region , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining in _RARE_ , cortex , most _RARE_ cells , _RARE_ cells , or _RARE_ . STO
* Within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the _RARE_ . STO
* No antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells . STO
* These areas are thought to represent the nuclei . STO
* In some tumor sections small spherical bodies , possibly _RARE_ bodies ( _RARE_ and Black , 1952 ) stained more intensely than the rest of _RARE_ and probably contained more antigen . STO
* In all cases studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain detectable amounts of WTV antigen . STO
* _RARE_ In both the direct and indirect methods of staining , the conjugates had _RARE_ staining fractions . STO
* In the indirect method , this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with NS and Af or with Af only . STO
* In the direct method , Af , not further treated , stained certain tissues of healthy sweet clover stems _RARE_ and WTV tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable Af . STO
* After Af and Af were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present . STO
* _RARE_ of the conjugates with _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the conjugates ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) with mouse liver powder , sweet clover crown gall tissue powder , or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily remove _RARE_ staining substances in the conjugates . STO
* Such treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating nonspecific staining in several other systems ( _RARE_ , 1958 ) . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant tissues with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ virus . STO
* The reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known . STO
* In our work the best procedure for _RARE_ substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second _RARE_ fractions with sweet clover tissue powder . STO
* The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few _RARE_ cells in the _RARE_ region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors . STO
* A study of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is _RARE_ distributed in the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ virus is a _RARE_ _RARE_ virus not easily _RARE_ by mechanical _RARE_ ( Black , 1944 ; ; _RARE_ et al , 1954 ) . STO
* The concentration and apparent _RARE_ of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order to _RARE_ plants . STO
* Since emotional reactions in the higher _RARE_ depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . STO
* In experiments with _RARE_ application of _RARE_ on the _RARE_ cortex , the transmission of _RARE_ from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . STO
* Moreover , the _RARE_ of the hypothalamus to _RARE_ stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . STO
* Even more complex and obviously _RARE_ induced forms of emotional _RARE_ could be _RARE_ in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . STO
* A previously _RARE_ conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . STO
* It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the _RARE_ and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* In addition , the _RARE_ relations play a great role in _RARE_ , as _RARE_ interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' _RARE_ . STO
* But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the _RARE_ , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the _RARE_ brain is _RARE_ by the neocortex . STO
* _RARE_ stressed correctly the importance of the _RARE_ brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the _RARE_ brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions . STO
* It should be added that in man _RARE_ _RARE_ probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ experiences are obviously of great importance for the _RARE_ and quantitative emotional response . STO
* The _RARE_ brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory , but this _RARE_ is beyond the scope of this paper . STO
* 13 . STO
* _RARE_ balance and its significance After this brief discussion of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ relations , let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance . STO
* _RARE_ processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via _RARE_ and descending _RARE_ . STO
* Thus _RARE_ discharges induced by _RARE_ application of _RARE_ to a minute area in the neocortex _RARE_ with _RARE_ present in the hypothalamus and cause increased _RARE_ discharges . STO
* On the other hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic _RARE_ through the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ until the hypothalamic _RARE_ is restored . STO
* Apparently , a positive _RARE_ exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the _RARE_ cortex . STO
* Consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic _RARE_ falls below the physiological level , the _RARE_ _RARE_ discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the _RARE_ discharges . STO
* Obviously , a vicious cycle _RARE_ . STO
* This tendency can be broken either by _RARE_ hypothalamic _RARE_ directly or via _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It is believed that drug therapy and _RARE_ involve the former and _RARE_ the latter mechanism . STO
* Before we comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from _RARE_ . STO
* Thus , a low intensity of _RARE_ discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during _RARE_ , resulting in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in the former and _RARE_ in the latter condition . STO
* Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level _RARE_ , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the _RARE_ and motor apparatus of the _RARE_ nervous system . STO
* With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur . STO
* Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of _RARE_ while stimulation of the _RARE_ hypothalamus _RARE_ sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole _RARE_ is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus . STO
* Similar effects can be induced _RARE_ via the _RARE_ _RARE_ in man and animals . STO
* Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect . STO
* Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance . STO
* The former comprise _RARE_ and _RARE_ drugs , the latter the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as , for instance , between _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ as these differences are , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce _RARE_ , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes _RARE_ effects and , eventually , _RARE_ changes . STO
* The emotional states produced by drugs influence the _RARE_ _RARE_ in a characteristic manner ; ; _RARE_ prevails in the _RARE_ of the experimental animal after administration of _RARE_ , but _RARE_ after application of _RARE_ and _RARE_ drugs . STO
* The shock _RARE_ act likewise on the hypothalamic balance . STO
* _RARE_ experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the _RARE_ controlled _RARE_ _RARE_ and increase sympathetic discharges . STO
* They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side . STO
* This _RARE_ the beneficial effect of _RARE_ therapy in certain _RARE_ and a shift in the reaction from _RARE_ to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the _RARE_ test . STO
* Some investigators have found a _RARE_ between _RARE_ and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the _RARE_ test and , _RARE_ , between clinical _RARE_ and increasing deviation of this test from the _RARE_ . STO
* Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of _RARE_ patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . STO
* The _RARE_ and _RARE_ tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of _RARE_ autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . STO
* It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring _RARE_ in _RARE_ patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the _RARE_ cycle . STO
* A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* In both conditions the emotional and _RARE_ sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such as is seen _RARE_ or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . STO
* The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be _RARE_ . STO
* Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to _RARE_ alterations in reactivity . STO
* A state of parasympathetic `` _RARE_ '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the _RARE_ reactivity of this structure to direct and _RARE_ induced _RARE_ , but leads also to an autonomic _RARE_ : a stimulus acting _RARE_ under control conditions _RARE_ in this state of _RARE_ a parasympathetic response ! STO
* Furthermore , conditioned reactions are _RARE_ altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is _RARE_ beyond a critical level , and several types of _RARE_ changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic `` _RARE_ '' are observed . STO
* If , for instance , such a change is produced by one or a few _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ , previously _RARE_ conditioned reactions _RARE_ . STO
* However , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily _RARE_ . STO
* In other studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned _RARE_ resulted from repeated _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ processes . STO
* It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental _RARE_ in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ; ( 2 ) drugs _RARE_ the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned reactions ; ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to _RARE_ a conditioned reaction but cause an increased _RARE_ instead of the _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) effect on the Aj . STO
* These are few and seemingly _RARE_ data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , _RARE_ action , or clinical processes . STO
* 14 . STO
* On the physiological basis of some form of _RARE_ The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion . STO
* If this is the case , one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise . STO
* We pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to _RARE_ _RARE_ and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the _RARE_ of a strong emotion ( `` _RARE_ '' ) may cure a battle _RARE_ . STO
* This phenomenon _RARE_ the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the _RARE_ . STO
* Being a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself . STO
* _RARE_ experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area . STO
* He showed _RARE_ that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned ) reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical _RARE_ and assumed , therefore , that the _RARE_ changes which _RARE_ the _RARE_ are functional and reversible . STO
* An important observation of _RARE_ served as a guide post to achieve such a _RARE_ by physiological means . STO
* In a conditioning experiment , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain . STO
* A mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding . STO
* The pain became thus the symbol for food and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( conditioned _RARE_ ) . STO
* Even when the intensity of the _RARE_ was increased gradually , it failed to _RARE_ any signs of pain . STO
* Since strong _RARE_ _RARE_ produce an experimental _RARE_ during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , _RARE_ thought that he could utilize the _RARE_ antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding . STO
* _RARE_ experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible . STO
* He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human _RARE_ . STO
* He took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive _RARE_ and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established . STO
* For the interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and _RARE_ functions which are closely associated with the emotions . STO
* The _RARE_ antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the _RARE_ and _RARE_ systems . STO
* Furthermore , a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety . STO
* Although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present , different _RARE_ patterns _RARE_ _RARE_ and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , the state of the muscle tone , and the _RARE_ test . STO
* The psychological _RARE_ of these emotional states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference . STO
* 15 . STO
* _RARE_ remarks In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the _RARE_ and _RARE_ systems , respectively . STO
* We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the _RARE_ downward discharge as well as regarding the _RARE_ discharge . STO
* Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the _RARE_ discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various _RARE_ and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical _RARE_ , and as the result of _RARE_ agents . STO
* In view of the important role which emotional _RARE_ play in the _RARE_ of neurotic and _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic _RARE_ may play an important role in _RARE_ mental changes . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* The primary decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the _RARE_ space V , by _RARE_ T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . STO
* We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the _RARE_ field F into a product of distinct _RARE_ polynomials of degree 1 . STO
* What can we do with the general T ? STO
* If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . STO
* First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the _RARE_ field , namely , that it is not _RARE_ closed . STO
* Second , even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V . STO
* This is clearly a deficiency in T . STO
* The second situation is illustrated by the operator T on Af ( F any field ) represented in the standard basis by Af . STO
* The characteristic polynomial for A is Af and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A ( or for T ) . STO
* Thus T is not diagonalizable . STO
* One sees that this happens because the null space of Af has dimension 1 only . STO
* On the other hand , the null space of Af and the null space of Af together span V , the former being the subspace _RARE_ by Af and the latter the subspace _RARE_ by Af and Af . STO
* This will be more or less our general method for the second problem . STO
* If ( remember this is an assumption ) the minimal polynomial for T _RARE_ Af where Af are distinct elements of F , then we shall show that the space V is the direct sum of the null spaces of Af . STO
* The diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which Af for each _RARE_ . STO
* The theorem which we prove is more general than what we have described , since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial , whether or not the _RARE_ which enter are all of first degree . STO
* The reader will find it helpful to think of the special case when the _RARE_ are of degree 1 , and even more particularly , to think of the proof of Theorem 10 , a special case of this theorem . STO
* Theorem 12 . STO
* ( primary decomposition theorem ) . STO
* Let T be a linear operator on the _RARE_ vector space V over the field F . STO
* Let p be the minimal polynomial for T , Af , where the Af , are distinct _RARE_ _RARE_ polynomials over F and the Af are positive _RARE_ . STO
* Let Af be the null space of Af . STO
* Then ( A ) Af ; ; ( B ) each Af is invariant under T ; ; ( C ) if Af is the operator induced on Af by T , then the minimal polynomial for Af is Af . STO
* Proof . STO
* The idea of the proof is this . STO
* If the _RARE_ decomposition ( A ) is valid , how can we get hold of the projections Af associated with the decomposition ? STO
* The _RARE_ Af will be the identity on Af and zero on the other Af . STO
* We shall find a polynomial Af such that Af is the identity on Af and is zero on the other Af , and so that Af , etc. . STO
* For each _RARE_ , let Af . STO
* Since Af are distinct prime polynomials , the polynomials Af are relatively prime ( Theorem 8 , Chapter 4 ) . STO
* Thus there are polynomials Af such that Af . STO
* Note also that if Af , then Af is _RARE_ by the polynomial p , because Af contains each Af as a factor . STO
* We shall show that the polynomials Af behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of the proof . STO
* Let Af . STO
* Since Af and P divides Af for Af , we have Af . STO
* Thus the Af are projections which _RARE_ to some _RARE_ decomposition of the space V . STO
* We wish to show that the range of Af is exactly the subspace Af . STO
* It is clear that each vector in the range of Af is in Af for if **ya is in the range of Af , then Af and so Af because Af is _RARE_ by the minimal polynomial P . STO
* _RARE_ , suppose that **ya is in the null space of Af . STO
* If Af , then Af is _RARE_ by Af and so Af , i.e. , Af . STO
* But then it is immediate that Af , i.e. , that **ya is in the range of Af . STO
* This _RARE_ the proof of statement ( A ) . STO
* It is certainly clear that the _RARE_ Af are invariant under T . STO
* If Af is the operator induced on Af by T , then evidently Af , because by definition Af is 0 on the subspace Af . STO
* This shows that the minimal polynomial for Af divides Af . STO
* _RARE_ , let G be any polynomial such that Af . STO
* Then Af . STO
* Thus Af is _RARE_ by the minimal polynomial P of T , i.e. , Af divides Af . STO
* It is easily seen that Af divides G . STO
* Hence the minimal polynomial for Af is Af . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* If Af are the projections associated with the primary decomposition of T , then each Af is a polynomial in T , and accordingly if a linear operator U _RARE_ with T then U _RARE_ with each of the Af , i.e. , each subspace Af is invariant under U . STO
* In the _RARE_ of the proof of Theorem 12 , let us take a look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for T is a product of _RARE_ polynomials , i.e. , the case in which each Af is of the form Af . STO
* Now the range of Af is the null space Af of Af . STO
* Let us put Af . STO
* By Theorem 10 , D is a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of T . STO
* Let us look at the operator Af . STO
* Now Af Af so Af . STO
* The reader should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that Af and in general that Af . STO
* When Af for each _RARE_ , we shall have Af , because the operator Af will then be 0 on the range of Af . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Let N be a linear operator on the vector space V . STO
* We say that N is nilpotent if there is some positive _RARE_ R such that Af . STO
* Theorem 13 . STO
* Let T be a linear operator on the _RARE_ vector space V over the field F . STO
* Suppose that the minimal polynomial for T _RARE_ over F into a product of linear polynomials . STO
* Then there is a diagonalizable operator D on V and a nilpotent operator N in V such that ( A ) Af , ( _RARE_ ) Af . STO
* The diagonalizable operator D and the nilpotent operator N are uniquely determined by ( A ) and ( B ) and each of them is a polynomial in T . STO
* Proof . STO
* We have just observed that we can write Af where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent , and where D and N not only commute but are polynomials in T . STO
* Now suppose that we also have Af where D' is diagonalizable , N' is nilpotent , and Af . STO
* We shall prove that Af . STO
* Since D' and N' commute with one another and Af , we see that D' and N' commute with T . STO
* Thus D' and N' commute with any polynomial in T ; ; hence they commute with D and with N . STO
* Now we have Af or Af and all four of these operators commute with one another . STO
* Since D and D' are both diagonalizable and they commute , they are simultaneously diagonalizable , and Af is diagonalizable . STO
* Since N and N' are both nilpotent and they commute , the operator Af is nilpotent ; ; for , using the fact that N and N' commute Af and so when R is sufficiently large every term in this expression for Af will be 0 . STO
* ( Actually , a nilpotent operator on an _RARE_ space must have its T power 0 ; ; if we take Af above , that will be large enough . STO
* It then follows that Af is large enough , but this is not obvious from the above expression . STO
* ) Now Af is a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent . STO
* Such an operator is obviously the zero operator ; ; for since it is nilpotent , the minimal polynomial for this operator is of the form Af for some Af ; ; but then since the operator is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; ; hence Af and the minimal polynomial is simply _RARE_ , which says the operator is 0 . STO
* Thus we see that Af and Af . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Let V be a _RARE_ vector space over an _RARE_ closed field F , e.g. , the field of complex numbers . STO
* Then every linear operator T in V can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator D and a nilpotent operator N which commute . STO
* These operators D and N are unique and each is a polynomial in T . STO
* From these results , one sees that the study of linear operators on vector spaces over an _RARE_ closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators . STO
* For vector spaces over _RARE_ closed fields , we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors . STO
* It is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter . STO
* In _RARE_ this section , we should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem . STO
* We have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus is not purely linear _RARE_ . STO
* Example 11 . STO
* In the primary decomposition theorem , it is not necessary that the vector space V be finite dimensional , nor is it necessary for parts ( A ) and ( B ) that P be the minimal polynomial for T . STO
* If T is a linear operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a _RARE_ polynomial P such that Af , then parts ( A ) and ( B ) of Theorem 12 are valid for T with the proof which we gave . STO
* Let N be a positive _RARE_ and let V be the space of all N times continuously _RARE_ functions F on the real line which satisfy the differential equation Af where Af are some fixed constants . STO
* If Af denotes the space of N times continuously _RARE_ functions , then the space V of solutions of this differential equation is a subspace of Af . STO
* If D denotes the differentiation operator and P is the polynomial Af then V is the null space of the operator p ( , ) , because Af simply says Af . STO
* Let us now regard D as a linear operator on the subspace V . STO
* Then Af . STO
* If we are discussing _RARE_ _RARE_ functions , then Af and V are complex vector spaces , and Af may be any complex numbers . STO
* We now write Af where Af are distinct complex numbers . STO
* If Af is the null space of Af , then Theorem 12 says that Af . STO
* In other words , if F _RARE_ the differential equation Af , then F is uniquely _RARE_ in the form Af where Af _RARE_ the differential equation Af . STO
* Thus , the study of the solutions to the equation Af is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form Af . STO
* This reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear _RARE_ , i.e. , by the primary decomposition theorem . STO
* To describe the space of solutions to Af , one must know something about differential equations ; ; that is , one must know something about D other than the fact that it is a linear operator . STO
* However , one does not need to know very much . STO
* It is very easy to establish by _RARE_ on R that if F is in Af then Af ; ; that is , Af , etc. . STO
* Thus Af if and only if Af . STO
* A function G such that Af , i.e. , Af , must be a polynomial function of degree Af or less : Af . STO
* Thus F _RARE_ Af if and only if F has the form Af . STO
* Accordingly , the ' functions ' Af span the space of solutions of Af . STO
* Since Af are _RARE_ independent functions and the _RARE_ function has no _RARE_ , these R functions Af , form a basis for the space of solutions . STO
* 7-1 . STO
* Examples of binomial experiments Some experiments are composed of _RARE_ of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes . STO
* The binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another . STO
* We _RARE_ a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that _RARE_ in many other probability models . STO
* We begin with a few examples of binomial experiments . STO
* _RARE_ example . STO
* A trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times . STO
* In repeated sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary . STO
* What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes ? STO
* _RARE_ in mice . STO
* In _RARE_ of eight mice from similar parents , the number of mice with straight instead of _RARE_ hair is an _RARE_ from 0 to 8 . STO
* What probabilities should be attached to these possible outcomes ? STO
* _RARE_ ( ones ) with three dice . STO
* When three dice are tossed repeatedly , what is the probability that the number of _RARE_ is 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 ) ? STO
* General binomial problem . STO
* More generally , suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials , that each trial results in either a `` success '' or a `` _RARE_ '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial . STO
* In the examples above , the occurrence of a bull's-eye , a _RARE_ mouse , or an ace could be called a `` success '' . STO
* In general , any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success '' . STO
* The major question in this chapter is : What is the probability of exactly X successes in N trials ? STO
* In _RARE_ 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples , usually by counting points in a sample space . STO
* Fortunately , a general formula of wide _RARE_ _RARE_ all problems of this kind . STO
* Before _RARE_ this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' . STO
* Experiments are often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated . STO
* In the _RARE_ example , a trial consists of `` one round shot at a target '' with outcome either one bull's-eye ( success ) or none ( failure ) . STO
* Further , an experiment might consist of five rounds , and several sets of five rounds might be regarded as a _RARE_ composed of several _RARE_ of the _RARE_ experiment . STO
* If three dice are tossed , a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials . STO
* Or , what amounts to the same thing , if one die is tossed three times , each toss is a trial , and the three _RARE_ form the experiment . STO
* _RARE_ , we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times . STO
* These examples are _RARE_ of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too _RARE_ . STO
* Example 1 . STO
* Student _RARE_ managers . STO
* Ten students act as managers for a _RARE_ _RARE_ team , and of these managers a proportion P are _RARE_ drivers . STO
* Each Friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck . STO
* On three _RARE_ the _RARE_ has needed a driver . STO
* _RARE_ only these _RARE_ , what is the probability that the _RARE_ had drivers all 3 times ? STO
* _RARE_ 2 times ? STO
* 1 time ? STO
* 0 times ? STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Note that there are 3 trials of interest . STO
* Each trial consists of choosing a student manager at random . STO
* The 2 possible outcomes on each trial are `` driver '' or `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* Since the choice is by lot each week , the outcomes of different trials are independent . STO
* The managers stay the same , so that Af is the same for all weeks . STO
* We now _RARE_ these ideas for general binomial experiments . STO
* For an experiment to _RARE_ as a binomial experiment , it must have four properties : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trials , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trials must have identical probabilities of success , ( 4 ) the trials must be independent of each other . STO
* Below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties . STO
* We also give , for each property , an example where the property is absent . STO
* The language and _RARE_ introduced are standard throughout the chapter . STO
* 1 . STO
* There must be a fixed number _RARE_ of repeated trials . STO
* For the marksman , we study sets of five shots ( Af ) ; ; for the mice , we restrict attention to _RARE_ of eight ( Af ) ; ; and for the _RARE_ , we toss three dice ( Af ) . STO
* _RARE_ without a fixed number of trials . STO
* _RARE_ a die until an ace appears . STO
* Here the number of trials is a random variable , not a fixed number . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ trials . STO
* Each of the N trials is either a success or a failure . STO
* `` Success '' and `` failure '' are just convenient _RARE_ for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial trials in general . STO
* These words are more _RARE_ than _RARE_ like `` A '' and `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* It is natural from the _RARE_ _RARE_ to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse . STO
* The word `` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both _RARE_ apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms P and Af that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure '' . STO
* Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have _RARE_ constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ without the _RARE_ property . STO
* We _RARE_ mice as `` _RARE_ '' or `` _RARE_ '' , but a _RARE_ mouse appears . STO
* We can escape from such a difficulty by _RARE_ out the animal as not _RARE_ a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory . STO
* 3 . STO
* All trials have identical probabilities of success . STO
* Each die has probability Af of producing an ace ; ; the marksman has some probability p , perhaps 0.1 , of making a bull's-eye . STO
* Note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial . STO
* _RARE_ where p is not constant . STO
* During a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and _RARE_ the marksman , _RARE_ his chance of a bull's-eye . STO
* 4 . STO
* The trials are independent . STO
* _RARE_ speaking , this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by _RARE_ together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials . STO
* Thus in the _RARE_ example Af , Af , and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace , _RARE_ , ace in that order is Af . STO
* _RARE_ , we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another . STO
* Examples where independence fails . STO
* A family of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains , and a coin is tossed to decide . STO
* We want to know the number of people going to the mountains . STO
* When this experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials , one for each member of the family , the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent . STO
* Indeed , the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family . STO
* The following is a less extreme example of dependence . STO
* Consider couples visiting an art _RARE_ . STO
* Each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ for one picture may be called `` success '' , for the other `` failure '' . STO
* An experiment consists of the voting of one couple , or two trials . STO
* In _RARE_ of the experiment from couple to couple , the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply , because couples who visit the _RARE_ together are more likely to have similar _RARE_ than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors . STO
* Table 7-1 illustrates the point . STO
* The table shows that _RARE_ of the boys and _RARE_ of the girls vote for picture A . STO
* Therefore , under independent voting , Af or _RARE_ of the couples would cast two votes for picture A , and Af or _RARE_ would cast two votes for picture B . STO
* Thus in independent voting , Af or _RARE_ of the couples would agree . STO
* But Table 7-1 shows that Af or _RARE_ agree , too many for independent voting . STO
* Each performance of an _RARE_ binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0 through N as the value of the random variable X , where Af . STO
* We want to study the probability function of this random variable . STO
* For example , we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes , not which shots were bull's-eyes . STO
* A binomial experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes . STO
* For example , the marksman gets 5 shots , but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first bull's-eye , that is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he gets no bull's-eye ) . STO
* Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random variable is not the number of successes . STO
* The constancy of P and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in practice . STO
* Obviously , very slight changes in P do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an _RARE_ difference . STO
* ( For instance , see Example 2 of Section _RARE_ , on red cards in hands of 5 . STO
* ) On the other hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a _RARE_ for comparative purposes ; ; that is , we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its _RARE_ from the binomial model . STO
* To _RARE_ : A binomial experiment consists of Af independent binomial trials , all with the same probability Af of _RARE_ a success . STO
* The outcome of the experiment is X successes . STO
* The random variable X takes the values Af with probabilities Af or , more briefly Af . STO
* We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly X successes for given values of P and N . STO
* When each number of successes X is _RARE_ with its probability of occurrence Af , the set of pairs Af , is a probability function called a binomial distribution . STO
* The choice of P and N determines the binomial distribution uniquely , and different _RARE_ always produce different distributions ( except when Af ; ; then the number of successes is always 0 ) . STO
* The set of all binomial distributions is called the family of binomial distributions , but in general discussions this expression is often _RARE_ to `` the binomial distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context is clear . STO
* _RARE_ distributions were treated by James _RARE_ about _RARE_ , and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called _RARE_ trials . STO
* _RARE_ variables . STO
* Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success . STO
* Therefore each binomial trial can be thought of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 , with probabilities Q and P respectively . STO
* The several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable X , the total number of successes , which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials . STO
* Example 2 . STO
* The marksman gets two bull's-eyes , one on his third shot and one on his fifth . STO
* The numbers of successes on the five individual shots are , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 . STO
* The number of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1 , and there are 5 such random variables here . STO
* Their sum is X , the total number of successes , which in this experiment has the value Af . STO
* Consider a simple , closed , plane curve C which is a _RARE_ image of the unit circle , and which is given by Af . STO
* These are real analytic _RARE_ functions with period T . STO
* In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . STO
* This theorem is similar to the theorem of _RARE_ that there exists a _RARE_ _RARE_ around any closed , bounded _RARE_ set in Af . STO
* The latter theorem has been generalized by _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and _RARE_ to show that in Af there are families of such _RARE_ . STO
* Here , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to _RARE_ and give certain other results . STO
* A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C . STO
* Indeed , the _RARE_ Af , with the two _RARE_ connected by a straight line _RARE_ only one inscribed square . STO
* The square has one corner point on the straight line _RARE_ , and does not lie entirely in the interior . STO
* On C , from the point P at Af to the point Q at Af , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as S approaches zero the square is inside C . STO
* As S increases we consider the two free corner points of the square , Af and Af , adjacent to P and Q respectively . STO
* As S approaches T the square will be outside C and therefore both Af and Af must cross C an odd number of times as S varies from zero to T . STO
* The points may also touch C without crossing . STO
* Suppose Af _RARE_ C when Af . STO
* We now have certain squares with three corners on C . STO
* For any such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the _RARE_ point of the square . STO
* Each point on C , as a vertex , may possess a finite number of corresponding _RARE_ points by the above construction . STO
* To each _RARE_ vertex and _RARE_ point there corresponds a unique forward corner point , i.e. , the corner on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex in the direction of increasing T . STO
* If the vertex is at Af , and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C _RARE_ through _RARE_ about the vertex . STO
* The set of intersections of Af , the rotated curve , with the original curve C consists of just the set of forward corner points on C corresponding to the vertex at Af , plus the vertex itself . STO
* We note that two such curves C and Af , cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points ; ; otherwise , being analytic , they would coincide at all points , which is impossible since they do not coincide near Af . STO
* With each vertex we _RARE_ certain numerical values , namely the set of positive differences in the parameter T between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points . STO
* For the vertex at Af , these values will be denoted by Af . STO
* The function f{t} defined in this way is _RARE_ . STO
* We consider now the graph of the function f{t} on Af . STO
* We will refer to the plane of C and Af as the C-plane and to the plane of the graph as the Aj . STO
* The graph , as a set , may have a finite number of components . STO
* We will _RARE_ the values of f{t} on different components by Af . STO
* Each point with _RARE_ T on the graph represents an intersection between C and Af . STO
* There are two types of such intersections , depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection . STO
* An ordinary point will be any point of intersection A such that in every neighborhood of A in the C-plane , Af meets both the interior and the _RARE_ of C . STO
* Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point . STO
* This _RARE_ will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj . STO
* We can now prove several _RARE_ . STO
* Lemma 1 . STO
* In some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph , the function _RARE_ is a single-valued , continuous function . STO
* Proof . STO
* We first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood . STO
* With the vertex at Af in the C-plane we assume that Af is the _RARE_ location on C of an ordinary intersection Q between C and Af . STO
* In the f-plane the _RARE_ of the corresponding point are Af . STO
* We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic . STO
* In the C-plane we construct a set of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , V with the origin at Q and such that both C and Af have finite slope at Q . STO
* _RARE_ Q , both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U . STO
* In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued , analytic function of U . STO
* Furthermore , one can find a neighborhood of Q in which the difference function is _RARE_ , for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of _RARE_ in any interval . STO
* Now , to find Af , one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q . STO
* But Af is just the curve Af translated without rotation through a small arc , for Af is always obtained by rotating C through exactly _RARE_ . STO
* The arc is itself a _RARE_ of an analytic curve . STO
* Thus if E is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every E then the difference between C and Af near Q would not be a _RARE_ function . STO
* Therefore , Af is single-valued near Q . STO
* It is also seen that Af , since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation . STO
* Thus Af is also continuous at Af , and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point . STO
* We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph . STO
* This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals . STO
* The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a _RARE_ function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point . STO
* This _RARE_ the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points . STO
* Lemma 2 . STO
* In some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say Af , the function Af is either _RARE_ or has no values defined , except at the tangent point itself , where it is single-valued . STO
* Proof . STO
* A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another . STO
* A continuous change in T through an amount E results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve Af . STO
* There are three possibilities : ( A ) Af remains tangent to C as it is translated ; ; ( B ) Af moves away from C and does not intersect it at all for Af ; ; ( C ) Af cuts across C and there are two ordinary intersections for every T in Af . STO
* The first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points in the f-plane , the end points of which fall into category ( B ) or ( C ) . STO
* In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af . STO
* In the third category the function is _RARE_ in this interval . STO
* The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af . STO
* Again , the _RARE_ of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist . STO
* In the neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is _RARE_ or _RARE_ on one side , and is a single-valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side . STO
* With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F . STO
* First , for any value of T for which all values of f{t} are ordinary points the number of values of f{t} must be odd . STO
* For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and Af must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior of C , Af could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at T is the argument of the function , not a value . STO
* Therefore , for any value of T the number of values of f{t} is equal to the ( finite ) number of tangent points corresponding to the argument T plus an odd number . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* The number of ordinary values of the function f{t} at T will be called its multiplicity at T . STO
* Lemma 3 . STO
* The graph of _RARE_ has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj . STO
* Proof . STO
* We suppose not . STO
* Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded _RARE_ . STO
* Suppose Af is defined in the _RARE_ Af . STO
* Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane ; ; otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points . STO
* Further , we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of F can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even _RARE_ . STO
* Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number . STO
* This is true of all components which have such a bounded support . STO
* But this is a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f{t} is odd for every T . STO
* We have shown that the graph of F contains at least one component whose inverse is the entire interval _RARE_ , and whose multiplicity is odd . STO
* There must be an odd number of such components , which will be called complete components . STO
* The remaining ( incomplete ) components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument , and are defined only on a proper _RARE_ of Aj . STO
* We must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two points for which the corresponding _RARE_ points in the C-plane are on opposite sides of C . STO
* We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C . STO
* We erect a square with _RARE_ as a side and with free corners Af and Af adjacent to P and Q respectively . STO
* As S varies from zero to T , the values of S for which Af and Af cross C will be denoted by Af and Af respectively . STO
* We have Af , plus tangent points . STO
* These _RARE_ are just the ordinary values of Af . STO
* Lemma 4 . STO
* The values Af are the ordinary values at Af of a _RARE_ function _RARE_ which has components corresponding to those of f{t} . STO
* Proof . STO
* We first define a function _RARE_ as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on C and vertex at t , _RARE_ is the corresponding set of positive _RARE_ differences between T and the backward corner points . STO
* The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T . STO
* Now with P fixed at Af , _RARE_ occur when the corner Af _RARE_ C , and are among the values of S such that Af . STO
* The roots of this equation are just the _RARE_ of the intersections of the graph of B with a straight line of unit slope through Af in the _RARE_ ( the plane of the graph of _RARE_ ) . STO
* We define these values as Af , and define _RARE_ in the same way for each T . STO
* Thus we obtain _RARE_ by _RARE_ an _RARE_ _RARE_ in the Aj . STO
* Introduction . STO
* In 1 we investigate a new series of line _RARE_ in a _RARE_ space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . STO
* These are defined by a simple _RARE_ transformation of the points in which a general line meets a _RARE_ quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Af . STO
* Then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . STO
* No _RARE_ of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . STO
* 1 . STO
* Let Q be a _RARE_ quadric surface bearing _RARE_ Af and Af , and let **zg be a Af curve of order K on Q . STO
* A general line L meets Q in two points , Af and Af , through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus , Af , whose lines are simple secants of Aj . STO
* On these generators let Af and Af be , respectively , the _RARE_ conjugates of Af and Af with respect to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets Aj . STO
* The line Af is the image of L . STO
* Clearly , the transformation is _RARE_ . STO
* We observe first that no line , l , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q . STO
* For if it did , the plane of L and _RARE_ would contain two generators of Af , which is impossible . STO
* Moreover , from the _RARE_ transformation of _RARE_ on the generators of Af , it is clear that the only points of Q at which a line can meet its image are the points of Aj . STO
* Hence the _RARE_ of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj . STO
* The invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of **zg , since each of these meets Q in two points which are invariant . STO
* The order of this congruence is Af , since Af secants of a curve of symbol ( B ) on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point . STO
* The class of the congruence is Af , since an arbitrary plane meets **zg in K points . STO
* Since the complex of singular lines is of order K and since there is no complex of invariant lines , it follows from the formula Af that the order of the involution is Af . STO
* There are various sets of exceptional lines , or lines whose images are not unique . STO
* The most obvious of these is the _RARE_ complex of tangents to Q , each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to Q at the image of the point of _RARE_ of the given line . STO
* Thus _RARE_ of tangents to Q are transformed into _RARE_ of tangents . STO
* It is interesting that a 1 : 1 correspondence can be established between the lines of two such _RARE_ , so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent . STO
* For the lines of any plane , _RARE_ , meeting Q in a _RARE_ C , are transformed into the congruence of secants of the curve C' into which C is transformed in the point involution on Q . STO
* In particular , tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C' . STO
* Moreover , if Af and Af are two planes _RARE_ in a line l , tangent to Q at a point P , the two free intersections of the image curves Af and Af must coincide at _RARE_ , the image of P , and at this point Af and Af must have a common tangent _RARE_ . STO
* Hence , thought of as a line in a particular plane _RARE_ , any tangent to Q has a unique image and moreover this image is the same for all planes through L . STO
* Each generator , **yl , of Af is also exceptional , for each is transformed into the entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator is transformed by the point involution on Q . STO
* This curve is of symbol Af since it meets **yl , and hence every line of Af in the Af invariant points on **yl and since it obviously meets every line of Af in a single point . STO
* The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af . STO
* A final class of exceptional lines is _RARE_ from the following considerations : Since no two generators of Af can intersect , it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections . STO
* In other words , these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all . STO
* Now the only way in which all curves of the image family of Af can pass through a fixed point is to have a generator of Af which is not a secant but a tangent of **zg , for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into the point of _RARE_ . STO
* Since two curves of symbol Af on Q intersect in Af points , it follows that there are Af lines of Af which are tangent to Aj . STO
* Clearly , any line , l , of any bundle having one of these points of _RARE_ , T , as vertex will be transformed into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection of L and Q as vertex and lying in the plane determined by the image point and the generator of Af which is tangent to **zg at T . STO
* A line through two of these points , Af and Af , will be transformed into the entire _RARE_ congruence having the tangents to **zg at Af and Af as _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ , C , being a ( 1 , 1 ) curve on Q , meets the image of any line of Af , which we have already found to be a Af curve on Q , in Af points . STO
* Hence its image , C' , meets any line of Af in Af points . STO
* Moreover , C' obviously meets any line Af in a single point . STO
* Hence C' is a Af curve on Q . STO
* Therefore , the congruence of its secants , that is the image of a general plane field of lines , is of order Af and class Af . STO
* Finally , the image of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant lines , namely Af and whose class is the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines , namely Af . STO
* 2 . STO
* The preceding observations make it clear that there exist line _RARE_ of all orders greater than 1 with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve Aj . STO
* We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described . STO
* To do this we must first show that every line which meets **zg in a point P meets its image at P . STO
* To see this , consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj . STO
* By ( 1 ) , the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order Af which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve , C , of order Af . STO
* On C there is a Af correspondence in which the Af points cut from C by a general line , l , of the pencil _RARE_ to the point of intersection of the image of L and the plane of the pencil . STO
* Since C is rational , this correspondence has K _RARE_ , each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image . STO
* However , since the pencil contains a secant of **zg it actually contains only Af singular lines . STO
* To avoid this contradiction it is necessary that C be composite , with the secant of **zg and a curve of order Af as components . STO
* Thus it follows that the secants of **zg are all invariant . STO
* But if this is the case , then an arbitrary pencil of lines having a point , P , of **zg as vertex is transformed into a ruled surface of order Af having Af generators concurrent at P . STO
* Since a ruled surface of order N with N concurrent generators is necessarily a cone , it follows finally that every line through a point , P , of **zg meets its image at P , as asserted . STO
* Now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle with vertex , P , on **zg which is effected by the involution as a whole . STO
* From the preceding remarks , it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an _RARE_ fashion . STO
* Moreover , in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order Af , namely the cone of secants of **zg which pass through P . STO
* Hence it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective De _RARE_ involution of order Af and the invariant _RARE_ must have a multiple line of multiplicity either Af or Af . STO
* The first possibility requires that there be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points ; ; the second requires that there be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points . STO
* In each case , lines of the _RARE_ are transformed by _RARE_ within the _RARE_ they determine with the multiple secant . STO
* In the first case the fixed elements within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line _RARE_ the vertex , P , to the intersection of **zg and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant . STO
* In the second , the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex , P , to the two intersections of **zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant . STO
* The multiple secants , of course , are exceptional and in each case are transformed into _RARE_ of order Af . STO
* _RARE_ similar to these can be made at each point of Aj . STO
* Hence **zg must have either a regulus of _RARE_ secants or a regulus of _RARE_ secants . STO
* Moreover , if Af , no two of the multiple secants can intersect . STO
* For if such were the case , either the plane of the two lines would meet **zg in more than K points or , _RARE_ , the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined by the two lines would be too high . STO
* But if no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of **zg can intersect , then the regulus must be _RARE_ , or in other words , **zg must be either a Af or a Af curve on a _RARE_ quadric surface . STO
* We now observe that the case in which **zg is a Af curve on a quadric is impossible if the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which meet Aj . STO
* For any pencil in a plane containing a _RARE_ secant of **zg has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil in Af lines , namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of **zg and the multiple secant , plus an additional component to account for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil . STO
* However , if there is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely Af . STO
* This _RARE_ the preceding observations , and so , under the assumption of this paper , we must _RARE_ the possibility that **zg is a Af curve on a quadric surface . STO
* _RARE_ with the case in which **zg is a Af curve on a quadric Q , we first observe that the second regulus of Q consists precisely of the lines which join the two free intersections of **zg and the planes through any one of the multiple secants . STO
* For each of these lines meets Q in three points , namely two points on **zg and one point on one of the multiple secants . STO
* Now consider an arbitrary line , l , meeting Q in two points , Af and Af . STO
* If **ya is the multiple secant of **zg which passes through Af and _RARE_ is the simple secant of **zg which passes through Af , and if Af are the points in which **ya meets **zg , and if Af is the image of Af on the generator _RARE_ , it follows that the image of the line Af is Af . STO
* These societies can expect to face difficult times . STO
* As the _RARE_ processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their _RARE_ will be threatened by _RARE_ forces , the _RARE_ between _RARE_ and subjects , town and country , will _RARE_ ; ; new _RARE_ for power will emerge whose _RARE_ far exceed their competence ; ; old _RARE_ may lose their nerve and their sense of direction . STO
* National leaders will have to display the highest skills of _RARE_ to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's sense of identity . STO
* _RARE_ of a community of interest will have to be _RARE_ -- in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared _RARE_ of the past . STO
* Nevertheless , with _RARE_ and careful planning , some of the more _RARE_ and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped . STO
* The United States can help by _RARE_ a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . STO
* Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive _RARE_ for these societies to _RARE_ _RARE_ the tasks which they face . STO
* At the same time , we should recognize that the _RARE_ to change and the lack of _RARE_ and stability which _RARE_ these countries may make them particularly _RARE_ to _RARE_ and external adventures of all _RARE_ . STO
* It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less _RARE_ by fishing in the _RARE_ waters of international politics than by facing up to the _RARE_ tasks at home . STO
* We should do what we can to _RARE_ this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by _RARE_ firmly to _RARE_ actions on the world scene . STO
* When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to _RARE_ their potential for _RARE_ the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development . STO
* As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and _RARE_ world community . STO
* _RARE_ societies When we look at countries like _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different _RARE_ for policy . STO
* The men in power are committed in principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ have been launched , but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern . STO
* The society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly _RARE_ urban _RARE_ and a relatively _RARE_ rural _RARE_ , with very poor communications between the two . STO
* _RARE_ is _RARE_ by psychological _RARE_ to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be _RARE_ to achieve the national goals of modernization already _RARE_ accepted . STO
* Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective . STO
* In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . STO
* The colonial period has generally left people _RARE_ that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them -- and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the benefits of modern life . STO
* For example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most _RARE_ societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; ; such is the _RARE_ of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement . STO
* The civil services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal _RARE_ with the problems facing them ; ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice , _RARE_ , and competence . STO
* American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their _RARE_ there is not the slightest hope that they will either _RARE_ of _RARE_ their societies . STO
* We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call for effort as well as enthusiasm . STO
* Above all , we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the _RARE_ fact that they are responsible for their _RARE_ . STO
* Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest _RARE_ of performance can we provide telling assistance . STO
* With respect to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their _RARE_ , we can afford to wait , for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see . STO
* Our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on _RARE_ the central governments to assume the role of _RARE_ and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments . STO
* We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and provincial governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important _RARE_ of the economy is neglected . STO
* _RARE_ we should be _RARE_ the _RARE_ of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above all , how progress in each field _RARE_ to national progress . STO
* _RARE_ such as the _RARE_ Development Program in the _RARE_ have demonstrated that _RARE_ societies can work toward balanced national development . STO
* To achieve this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and _RARE_ of the people themselves are effectively taken into account . STO
* If modernization programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties . STO
* Land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries . STO
* It should be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to _RARE_ the relation of such _RARE_ to the economic growth and modernization of the society . STO
* As an isolated policy , land reform is likely to be _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance . STO
* It should also be recognized that the problem of rural _RARE_ cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone . STO
* Land reform programs need to be _RARE_ with programs for promoting rural _RARE_ and technical assistance in _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , governmental and private _RARE_ will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead . STO
* By holding out prospects for external capital assistance , the United States can provide strong _RARE_ to prepare for the _RARE_ economic drive necessary to achieve _RARE_ growth . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ societies At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , Brazil , the _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , which are ready and committed to move into the stage of _RARE_ growth . STO
* They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; ; and there _RARE_ the _RARE_ problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously _RARE_ participation in the program to wider and wider groups . STO
* But these countries have made big _RARE_ toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal _RARE_ and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies . STO
* On the economic front , the first priority of these countries is to _RARE_ a vastly increased volume of resources . STO
* Several related tasks must be carried out if _RARE_ growth is to be achieved . STO
* These countries must _RARE_ a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy . STO
* They must in their planning be able to count on at least tentative _RARE_ of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined _RARE_ enough to permit domestic investment _RARE_ to go forward . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ must be coordinated with national needs and planning . STO
* Finally , a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural _RARE_ , and general balance of payments support . STO
* Thus , although the _RARE_ of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of _RARE_ growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange . STO
* There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved . STO
* For one thing , although considerable numbers of men have been trained , _RARE_ are still _RARE_ in many respects ; ; even the _RARE_ Indian Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken . STO
* _RARE_ assistance in training _RARE_ and _RARE_ management personnel is still needed in many cases . STO
* There are also more basic problems . STO
* This is the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people . STO
* Nevertheless , _RARE_ still exist among the _RARE_ elite to _RARE_ and thus to _RARE_ the need for centralized and _RARE_ practices . STO
* Another great danger is that the _RARE_ middle class will feel itself increasingly _RARE_ from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of _RARE_ . STO
* The capacity of _RARE_ and members of the new professional classes to contribute _RARE_ to national development is likely to be destroyed by a _RARE_ sense of _RARE_ toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional _RARE_ in the West . STO
* _RARE_ when based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a _RARE_ of understanding about the national interest . STO
* _RARE_ of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push _RARE_ to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead more rigid and _RARE_ in their policies . STO
* American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the _RARE_ social and professional classes . STO
* It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and _RARE_ of _RARE_ open and _RARE_ societies . STO
* We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to _RARE_ _RARE_ and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in _RARE_ but friendly ways . STO
* The time factor We have emphasized that the _RARE_ process in each society will take a considerable period of time . STO
* With the exception of _RARE_ , foreign relations were _RARE_ concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least _RARE_ duration . STO
* Foreign policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at _RARE_ . STO
* American and _RARE_ policies can _RARE_ affect the pace of transition ; ; but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes , political institutions , and social structure which each society must generate . STO
* It follows that any effective policy toward the _RARE_ countries must have a _RARE_ long working horizon . STO
* It must be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its _RARE_ . STO
* This condition affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy , especially in the context of economic aid . STO
* 2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , _RARE_ societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it _RARE_ into the whole social organization and functions _RARE_ in every part of it . STO
* In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . STO
* With the diversity of religious _RARE_ , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . STO
* Nevertheless , for most of the population of _RARE_ advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain _RARE_ individual and social functions . STO
* Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . STO
* If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , _RARE_ , and emotionally secure _RARE_ ; ; he is not greatly _RARE_ , and he is not _RARE_ ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . STO
* There are several closely related inner functions . STO
* In the last analysis , religion is the means of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , expressing , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ man's deepest experience -- the religious . STO
* Man is first religious ; ; the _RARE_ follow . STO
* Religion _RARE_ to satisfy human needs of great _RARE_ . STO
* The significant things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* The chief experience is the sensing of _RARE_ , and in the higher religions , of a _RARE_ relationship with the _RARE_ power . STO
* _RARE_ to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , _RARE_ universe . STO
* Man has the experience of being _RARE_ allied with what he cannot fully understand ; ; he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement . STO
* The universe is a safe and permanent home . STO
* A number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal . STO
* _RARE_ is not permanent _RARE_ and disappearance ; ; man has a second chance . STO
* He is not lost in the _RARE_ of endless time ; ; he has endless being . STO
* Religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by _RARE_ man into the highest realm of the spirit . STO
* Religion can _RARE_ , _RARE_ , relate , and _RARE_ all the highest _RARE_ and values -- ethical , aesthetic , and religious -- of man formed in his culture . STO
* There is also the possibility , among higher religions , of _RARE_ consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and _RARE_ . STO
* The kind of religious experience that most _RARE_ seek not only provides , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ human _RARE_ , values , _RARE_ , and purposes ; ; it also provides facilities and _RARE_ for the development of personality , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* Under the religious impulse , whether _RARE_ or _RARE_ , men have joy in living ; ; life leads somewhere . STO
* Religion at its best is out in front , ever _RARE_ and leading on , and , as _RARE_ put it , `` _RARE_ all man's scattered energies in one _RARE_ sense of his own infinite importance '' . STO
* At the same time that religion _RARE_ the individual _RARE_ to the _RARE_ and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also has great therapeutic value for him . STO
* It gives him aid , comfort , even _RARE_ , in meeting _RARE_ life situations where his own _RARE_ practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate . STO
* He is confronted with the _RARE_ crises , such as great natural _RARE_ and the great _RARE_ of life -- marriage , _RARE_ disease , _RARE_ , old age , the certainty of death . STO
* He has to cope with _RARE_ and other emotional disturbance and _RARE_ . STO
* His religious beliefs provide him with _RARE_ explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern , and his religious faith makes possible _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , enabling him to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , fear , _RARE_ , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger . STO
* Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state . STO
* The belief in _RARE_ , where held , functions as a _RARE_ for the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the here and now . STO
* The _RARE_ accompanying a _RARE_ consciousness of _RARE_ or _RARE_ or some _RARE_ secret are relieved for the less _RARE_ or _RARE_ by confession , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* The feeling of individual _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ growing out of various social situations or individual _RARE_ or _RARE_ is _RARE_ for by _RARE_ in worship or prayer with a friendly , but _RARE_ _RARE_ , as well as by sympathetic _RARE_ with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies . STO
* In providing for these inner individual functions , religion _RARE_ in behalf of individual peace of mind and _RARE_ services for which there is no other institution . STO
* In addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society . STO
* The two have never been _RARE_ . STO
* Religion is _RARE_ necessary in both _RARE_ maintenance and regulation . STO
* The _RARE_ of a community or society is always _RARE_ with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions . STO
* The religion supports , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and maintains the fundamental values . STO
* Even in the United States , with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast _RARE_ differentiation , there is a general _RARE_ regarding the basic Christian values . STO
* This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of _RARE_ different value _RARE_ elsewhere ; ; for example Americans _RARE_ to Christian values _RARE_ those of _RARE_ communism . STO
* In America also all of our major religious bodies officially _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_ which is _RARE_ of our common religion . STO
* Even the _RARE_ members -- the _RARE_ , marginal _RARE_ and so on -- have the values of Christian civilization _RARE_ in them . STO
* Furthermore , religion tends to _RARE_ the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the _RARE_ and _RARE_ values ; ; for example , those regarding material objects and _RARE_ ends . STO
* Finally , it gives _RARE_ , more than human _RARE_ , and even , through _RARE_ reference , _RARE_ and _RARE_ importance to some values ; ; for example , marriage as a _RARE_ , much _RARE_ as _RARE_ , occasionally the state as a _RARE_ instrument . STO
* It places certain values at least beyond questioning and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends . STO
* This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social _RARE_ with a meaning _RARE_ in terms of ultimate ends ; ; for example , a plan that _RARE_ the will of God , which advances the _RARE_ of God , which involves social life as part of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ some group ends and provides a _RARE_ of their _RARE_ . STO
* It gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action . STO
* Finally , it gives meaning to much social _RARE_ , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life . STO
* In general , there is no society so _RARE_ as to be completely without _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ends . STO
* Religion _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Some of the oldest , most persistent , and most cohesive forms of social _RARE_ have grown out of religion . STO
* These groups have varied widely from mere families , primitive , _RARE_ groups , and small modern _RARE_ and _RARE_ , to the _RARE_ of great _RARE_ , and great , widely dispersed world religions . STO
* Religion _RARE_ group life in various ways . STO
* The common ultimate values , ends and goals _RARE_ by religion are a most important factor . STO
* Without a system of values there can be no society . STO
* Where such a value system prevails , it always _RARE_ all who possess it ; ; it _RARE_ members of the society to operate as a system . STO
* The beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , and form what _RARE_ calls a credo . STO
* As he points out , a religious group cannot exist without a collective credo , and the more extensive the credo , the more unified and strong is the group . STO
* The credo _RARE_ and _RARE_ men by _RARE_ them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the _RARE_ the group . STO
* The religious _RARE_ , and especially the closely related _RARE_ and worship forms , constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith . STO
* The religion , in fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large . STO
* The common codes , for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , _RARE_ the _RARE_ together . STO
* These are ways of jointly participating in significantly _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and ordered _RARE_ _RARE_ behavior . STO
* The codes are mechanism for training in , and _RARE_ and _RARE_ , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly _RARE_ the solidarity of the group . STO
* _RARE_ noted long ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things _RARE_ into one single moral community all those who _RARE_ to them '' . STO
* His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , _RARE_ , every community is in one aspect a religious unit . STO
* This is brought out in the common religious _RARE_ that prevails even in the _RARE_ diverse _RARE_ at many _RARE_ _RARE_ and public occasions in the United States ; ; and it is evidenced in the _RARE_ offered , in the frequent religious _RARE_ , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds . STO
* The _RARE_ effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that _RARE_ peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though _RARE_ dispersed and not _RARE_ organized . STO
* The Jews for _RARE_ years have been a prime example , though the _RARE_ of any world or _RARE_ religion are cases in point . STO
* It might be pointed out that the _RARE_ function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other _RARE_ -- political , _RARE_ , language , class , racial , _RARE_ , even economic . STO
* Religion usually exercises a _RARE_ function . STO
* As such it acts as an anchor for the people . STO
* There is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not only in their own _RARE_ and policies and practices , but also in _RARE_ affairs having religious relevance . STO
* It has thus been a significant factor in the _RARE_ of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones . STO
* It tends to support the _RARE_ precious _RARE_ , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living . STO
* As _RARE_ has pointed out , the `` _RARE_ on symbols , on tradition , on sacred _RARE_ , on the _RARE_ of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future '' . STO
* _RARE_ , religion has also _RARE_ as a tremendous engine of _RARE_ , enforcement , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ of various other institutions . STO
* At the same time that religion exercises a _RARE_ influence , it also _RARE_ and _RARE_ both individuals and groups . STO
* Much of the important individual and social action has been _RARE_ to religious _RARE_ . STO
* The great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent _RARE_ lights that _RARE_ people toward them with an almost _RARE_ force , _RARE_ energies and _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; for example , the _RARE_ , mission efforts , just wars . STO
* Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and _RARE_ of religion . STO
* The _RARE_ reward systems that most religions _RARE_ have great _RARE_ effects . STO
* Religion provides the most attractive _RARE_ , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely _RARE_ by its norms , but who engage in good works . STO
* Religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control , _RARE_ what men should or should not do . STO
* Among primitive peoples the sanctions and _RARE_ of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group ; ; and in modern societies such influence is still great . STO
* Religion has its own _RARE_ _RARE_ that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now . STO
* _RARE_ with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income , her defense of denial was _RARE_ strong . STO
* Thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a _RARE_ problem . STO
* The result , _RARE_ visible in a matter of days in the family's _RARE_ daily functioning , was a _RARE_ fear that some terrible harm would _RARE_ the second _RARE_ , whose birth had not been anticipated . STO
* Soon Mrs. _RARE_ fears threatened to burst into a _RARE_ panic concerning the welfare of the entire family . STO
* _RARE_ to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed _RARE_ , _RARE_ fatigue , repeated crying _RARE_ , and short _RARE_ reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the _RARE_ situation . STO
* Clearly , this was a family in crisis . STO
* Mrs. B. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother's death when she was eight , as well as her subsequent anger at her father for _RARE_ . STO
* Her previous _RARE_ experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday . STO
* On the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with _RARE_ tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral . STO
* In the family's own words ( during the third of twelve visits ) , they had `` reached the crisis peak -- either the situation will give or we will break '' ! STO
* Direct _RARE_ and acceptance of Mrs. _RARE_ anger against the second baby soon _RARE_ her fears of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents , when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , produced further relief of tension . STO
* In a joint interview Mr. and Mrs. B. were helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the _RARE_ . STO
* The father , accurately _RARE_ the child's needs , not only respected them as worthy of his attention , but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the _RARE_ , saying , `` I have a big lap ; ; there is room for you , too , Johnnie '' . STO
* _RARE_ , a variety of environmental supports -- a calm but not too _RARE_ _RARE_ , referral for temporary economic aid , intelligent use of nursing care , accompaniment to the _RARE_ _RARE_ for medical advice on the _RARE_ feeding problem -- combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms . STO
* _RARE_ visits of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's _RARE_ mental health and social functioning . STO
* As seen in the B. family , there must be an attempt to help the _RARE_ develop conscious awareness of the problem , especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance . STO
* The lack of awareness usually _RARE_ from deep but _RARE_ anxiety , often assuming the _RARE_ _RARE_ of `` not knowing '' or `` not caring '' . STO
* The _RARE_ use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled _RARE_ . STO
* In general , the approach is more active than passive , more _RARE_ than _RARE_ . STO
* While some regression is inevitable , it is _RARE_ rather than encouraged so that the _RARE_ does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework _RARE_ of the _RARE_ model for _RARE_ therapy . STO
* To establish an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential _RARE_ immediately , preferably within the first interview , by meeting the client's specific needs . STO
* These needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension . STO
* The initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely _RARE_ in an _RARE_ sense . STO
* In this _RARE_ stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem . STO
* In so doing he _RARE_ offers the positive _RARE_ of hope as a kind of _RARE_ dynamic to _RARE_ feelings of helplessness and _RARE_ generally associated with the first stages of stress impact . STO
* Thus , the _RARE_ receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf . STO
* Here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation . STO
* We are _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ phenomena such as undue regression , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , excessive use of denial , and _RARE_ guilt turned against the self . STO
* While some _RARE_ and some denial are not only necessary but healthy , the _RARE_ clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used , what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated , and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed . STO
* In steering the family toward _RARE_ and away from _RARE_ responses , the worker uses _RARE_ focused casework techniques of specific emotional support , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ guidance . STO
* Over a relatively short period of time , usually about four to twelve weeks , the worker must be able to shift the focus , back and forth , between immediate external _RARE_ _RARE_ ( `` _RARE_ stress '' ) and the key , emotionally relevant issues ( `` underlying problem '' ) which are , often in a dramatic _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ by the crisis situation , and hence once again _RARE_ to resolution . STO
* Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques , they do challenge the _RARE_ skill to _RARE_ them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic _RARE_ . STO
* Then , too , the _RARE_ clinical flexibility is necessary in _RARE_ _RARE_ carefully timed _RARE_ home visits , single and group office interviews , and appropriate telephone follow-up calls , if the worker is to be _RARE_ _RARE_ and if the predicted _RARE_ outcome is to be actually _RARE_ in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention . STO
* In addition , in many cases , a variety of concrete social resources -- _RARE_ , day care , medical and financial aid -- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to _RARE_ the family in its individual and collective coping and _RARE_ efforts . STO
* At certain critical stages , and only for sound diagnostic reasons , it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their _RARE_ behavior is to be constructive rather than _RARE_ . STO
* While expensive in time and involving a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker ( in terms of his _RARE_ to leave the _RARE_ of his office and enter actively into the client's life ) , techniques of accompaniment were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives . STO
* Finally , whatever the techniques used , a _RARE_ goal is common to all preventive casework service : to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to _RARE_ and use their ego _RARE_ . STO
* Having _RARE_ an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework , we now address ourselves to our final question : What place should brief , _RARE_ preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services ? STO
* We should first recognize our tendency to develop a _RARE_ of values , locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top , instead of seeing the services as part of a _RARE_ , each important in its own right . STO
* This problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself . STO
* Almost three decades ago _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ a study of _RARE_ _RARE_ because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services . STO
* Her conclusion has been borne out in the experience of many _RARE_ : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ is neither a _RARE_ nor a _RARE_ experience but is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work '' . STO
* Thus , casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended . STO
* That we are _RARE_ an _RARE_ of interest in the many formulations and preventive _RARE_ of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ is _RARE_ finding that the length of treatment per _RARE_ is not a reliable indicator of successful outcome . STO
* According to a number of studies , the important _RARE_ are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as well as the _RARE_ of the helping person . STO
* For example , the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for _RARE_ relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance _RARE_ where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project . STO
* Of startling significance , too , is the _RARE_ that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent _RARE_ rate as compared with a rate of _RARE_ percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in _RARE_ operated child guidance services . STO
* These reports refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance _RARE_ approached by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people . STO
* _RARE_ to the approach which I have described are evident in the _RARE_ establishment of a helping relationship , quick _RARE_ of key issues , and the immediate _RARE_ of treatment plans as the essential _RARE_ in helping to further the _RARE_ coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses . STO
* While there are many different possibilities for the _RARE_ of casework intervention , the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional _RARE_ all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client's initial need for help . STO
* In some programs , treatment is concentrated over a short period of time , while in others , after the initial contact is established , flexible _RARE_ of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success . STO
* _RARE_ to take the risk of early and direct interpretation ( with the _RARE_ that if the interpretation is too threatening , the worker can withdraw ) is another prominent feature in these efforts . STO
* My aim in _RARE_ this factor obviously is not to give license to `` wild therapy '' but rather to encourage us to use the _RARE_ clinical casework skills we already possess , and to use them with greater confidence , precision , and professional pride . STO
* Though there is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary -- or perhaps , in some instances , primary -- level , the place of short-term intervention has already been _RARE_ by a number of investigators in a wide variety of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , for example , has emphasized the `` need for a broad spectrum of services , including very brief services in connection with critical situations '' . STO
* _RARE_ , brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance . STO
* Moreover , the _RARE_ of treatment resources and the _RARE_ persistent _RARE_ of mental health manpower force us to _RARE_ additional _RARE_ of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available -- and on a more effective basis to more people . STO
* Further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the _RARE_ of traditional social casework services -- including attempts to develop a _RARE_ of family structures , crisis problems , reaction mechanisms , and differential treatment approaches -- and the establishment of new experimental programs are _RARE_ social needs which should command the best efforts of _RARE_ in _RARE_ with community _RARE_ . STO
* Our literature is already _RARE_ with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency _RARE_ ranging from the immediately practical to the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Probably , in the immediate future , we will have to settle for _RARE_ efforts that fall short of _RARE_ models . STO
* _RARE_ experimentation with _RARE_ agencies , especially those that _RARE_ _RARE_ the traditional functions of family and child welfare services , holds rich promise for the future . STO
* For example , child welfare experience _RARE_ with cases in which the _RARE_ request for substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is _RARE_ linked with a fundamental _RARE_ problem of family relationships . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . STO
* One of the devices for tension management is _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . STO
* The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in _RARE_ . STO
* It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . STO
* The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation . STO
* The _RARE_ building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as _RARE_ for _RARE_ and _RARE_ illustrate this supportive relationship . STO
* As _RARE_ remarks , `` In the internal pattern the chief reason for _RARE_ is to communicate liking , friendship , and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative _RARE_ to those who stand in _RARE_ relations '' . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of the status _RARE_ might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today . STO
* Yet , the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal _RARE_ for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war . STO
* _RARE_ to World War 2 , there was a higher percentage of _RARE_ marriages than after World War 2 . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* The norms , as elements , refer to `` all criteria for _RARE_ the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social system '' . STO
* The process of evaluation _RARE_ varying positive and negative _RARE_ or values to elements . STO
* The elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population . STO
* From the evidence `` it may be _RARE_ that core - core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and females ; ; core - marginal marriages still belong in the category of _RARE_ unions ; ; and core - Negro marriages are _RARE_ for core members '' . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* The element of _RARE_ and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of _RARE_ about them . STO
* Power . STO
* There is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power , primarily the voluntary influence of _RARE_ power , has been exerted on actors in the system , particularly in regard to mate selection . STO
* This would seem to vary from family to family , depending somewhat on the core or marginal `` status '' of that family . STO
* Again , size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ with members of the Brandywine population were attempted in order to discover the _RARE_ of the various families in the population . STO
* The large majority of the _RARE_ placed core families in the upper positions . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ a product of the evaluation process . STO
* `` The standing or rank of an actor in a given social system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in accordance with the norms and standards of the system '' . STO
* Despite the increasing rate of _RARE_ marriages , the population has been able to sustain , at least to some degree , the consciousness of its intermediate status in society . STO
* To some extent the system can be considered a _RARE_ in which `` _RARE_ _RARE_ are determined by birth , by attributes such as sex or _RARE_ , which are _RARE_ or socially _RARE_ '' . STO
* The _RARE_ of many in the population to the Indian background in their _RARE_ , and emphasis upon the fact that their _RARE_ had never been slaves , becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the _RARE_ of the intermediate status of the group in society . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* The negative sanctions applied to core - Negro marriages for core members act as indicators of expected _RARE_ to group norms . STO
* However , because of Church laws , lately more _RARE_ enforced , which _RARE_ the marriage of cousins closely related _RARE_ , a means of _RARE_ the goal of _RARE_ relations may be that of _RARE_ to _RARE_ unions . STO
* A _RARE_ survey of available material indicates a high rate of _RARE_ _RARE_ occurring to parents who have a close _RARE_ relationship . STO
* _RARE_ The comprehensive or master processes _RARE_ all or some of the elements within the social system and subsystems . STO
* Within the larger social system are the structural and functional subsystems . STO
* The structural _RARE_ , consisting of relatively stable _RARE_ among its parts , includes : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ of various types , _RARE_ by _RARE_ norms . STO
* 2 . STO
* _RARE_ of various types , within the larger system and within the subgroups 3 . STO
* _RARE_ norms governing subgroups and roles . STO
* 4 . STO
* _RARE_ values . STO
* In the study of marriage patterns for this group , _RARE_ produces the structural system -- a system of _RARE_ -- which , in turn , maintains the system of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of various types have been found within this system . STO
* Each family line can be considered a _RARE_ . STO
* There seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group . STO
* _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of core - Negro marriages for core families , discussed above , would seem to act as a _RARE_ _RARE_ governing subgroups and roles . STO
* The scope of this study does not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the subgroups . STO
* However , it cannot be presumed , informal though the structure of the population seems , that there are not _RARE_ roles within the system . STO
* The present study _RARE_ to the theory of functional systems . STO
* It is _RARE_ that fertility is a function of the social system when the population as a whole is considered and a function of the subsystems when the _RARE_ division of core families and marginal families is considered . STO
* The four functional problems of a social system are , to some extent , solved by the subsystems within this population . STO
* By means of geographical isolation and high fertility rates , _RARE_ can be _RARE_ and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained . STO
* In order to attain the goal of group solidarity and to _RARE_ tension , the high fertility rate provides more group members for mate selection , and the _RARE_ of members in groups _RARE_ acceptance of group controls . STO
* To maintain their intermediate position in the larger society , it is not only necessary that members of this population be `` visible '' , but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate , distinct _RARE_ or system in society . STO
* As mentioned above , where families are concentrated in larger numbers , group controls seem strongest and most effective . STO
* _RARE_ to the social and _RARE_ environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This provides the necessary contact with the larger society , while supporting a type of control over members in terms of social contacts . STO
* _RARE_ `` has to do with the _RARE_ of parts '' . STO
* The problem of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values . STO
* The values placed by the Brandywine population , upon maintaining a certain _RARE_ , a certain separate racial identity , and therefore a certain separate social status , are important for the morale of the system . STO
* Since morale is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration , the higher the morale and solidarity , the better the system can _RARE_ the problems of the system . STO
* In this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the Brandywine population and the white and Negro populations within the same general _RARE_ , the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the Brandywine population . STO
* It is conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation . STO
* In turn , higher fertility rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population , allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity . STO
* The population can thereby _RARE_ itself and actually grow larger . STO
* _RARE_ processes Of particular utility in the analysis of the development , persistence , and change of social systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ six such processes in his _RARE_ . STO
* 1 . STO
* _RARE_ 2 . STO
* _RARE_ maintenance 3 . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ 4 . STO
* _RARE_ 5 . STO
* Social control 6 . STO
* _RARE_ Though undoubtedly all six processes are _RARE_ within the whole social system and its subsystems , two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be _RARE_ out for particular emphasis . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* In discussing the process of communication , _RARE_ _RARE_ it as `` the process by which information , decisions , and _RARE_ are _RARE_ among actors and the ways in which knowledge , opinions , and attitudes are formed , or modified by interaction '' . STO
* _RARE_ may be _RARE_ by means of the high _RARE_ within the larger community . STO
* _RARE_ interaction is easier where segregated living and _RARE_ _RARE_ mark off a group from the rest of the community , as in the case of this population . STO
* However , the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation . STO
* Although the Brandywine population is still predominantly rural , `` there are indications of a consistent and a _RARE_ significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities . STO
* _RARE_ appears to be an important factor in the _RARE_ of this group . STO
* This conclusion is , however , an _RARE_ . STO
* A more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that Brandywine people in the _RARE_ area are , in general , less segregated _RARE_ than group members in rural areas . STO
* In the urban area , in other words , they , unlike some urban _RARE_ groups , do not concentrate in ghetto _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ pressures toward _RARE_ are slight or _RARE_ , and _RARE_ behavior in mate selection _RARE_ few if any social sanctions . STO
* In such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be _RARE_ , resulting in a change of values and , almost necessarily , in mate selection behavior . STO
* To the extent that urban life contributes to the _RARE_ of the group patterns of residential isolation , to that extent it contributes directly to increased _RARE_ '' . STO
* Social control . STO
* The process of social control is _RARE_ _RARE_ as sanctions play a part in the _RARE_ behavior , as well as the _RARE_ behavior . STO
* By means of this social control , _RARE_ is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group . STO
* Examples from this population indicate that _RARE_ seems to be _RARE_ by _RARE_ from the group . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* There is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society . STO
* _RARE_ and divided though this tradition may be , it is an important part of the social and cultural _RARE_ of the group , and acts as a means of _RARE_ , particularly for members of the rural community . STO
* The fact of Indian _RARE_ and `` free '' status during the days of slavery , are important _RARE_ made by members of the group . STO
* _RARE_ maintenance . STO
* `` _RARE_ induced social _RARE_ resulting from common norms and values _RARE_ by members of the group '' is _RARE_ in the boundary maintenance of the group as well as in the process of _RARE_ . STO
* The process of boundary maintenance _RARE_ and _RARE_ the social system or subsystems , and the characteristic interaction is maintained . STO
* As the threat of _RARE_ on the system increases , the `` probability of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms increases '' . STO
* The fertility rate pattern would seem to be a function , though a _RARE_ one , of the process of maintaining the boundary . STO
* `` _RARE_ boundary maintenance may be achieved , for example , by _RARE_ a higher _RARE_ or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern . STO
* '' The external pattern or external system can be considered as `` group behavior that _RARE_ the group to survive in its environment . STO
* '' _RARE_ maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social , as is the _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* It is also expressed in the _RARE_ against _RARE_ in the matter of _RARE_ , particularly in rural areas . STO
* By their pattern of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the _RARE_ contact they maintain . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries or limits of the group , _RARE_ _RARE_ is defined `` as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems is _RARE_ in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit . STO
* A royal _RARE_ issued in 1910 , two years after the _RARE_ government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by _RARE_ . STO
* Further decrees along this line were issued in _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* In _RARE_ a continuous registration of the whole _RARE_ population was instituted by _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ compilation of these records was ordered . STO
* But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial _RARE_ . STO
* A unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . STO
* The whole system was again reviewed and _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* General responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ et de _RARE_ _RARE_ ( AIMO , Af _RARE_ , Af _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ ) . STO
* _RARE_ authorities , the _RARE_ and their _RARE_ , were held responsible for maintaining the _RARE_ of _RARE_ persons within their _RARE_ , under the general supervision of district officials . STO
* The district officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to _RARE_ the annual _RARE_ of demographic statistics . STO
* The regulations require the _RARE_ of each individual ( male or female , adult or child ) on a separate card ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* The cards , filed by _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , or village ) , are kept in the headquarters of each _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* Each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned , including his or her date of birth ( or age at a specified time ) , _RARE_ , and children . STO
* Additional entries must be made from time to time . STO
* _RARE_ cards are used for males and females , and a corner is _RARE_ from the cards of adults , and of children when they reach _RARE_ . STO
* So a quick count could be made at any time , even by an _RARE_ clerk , of the number of registered persons in four _RARE_ classes . STO
* _RARE_ identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments , _RARE_ , periods of employment , and changes of residence are recorded . STO
* Similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females . STO
* Each adult is held personally responsible for _RARE_ his _RARE_ and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand . STO
* The registration card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons . STO
* The cards of permanent _RARE_ are , in theory , sent to an office in the place of new residence . STO
* Finally , the registration of _RARE_ and _RARE_ by nearest relatives was made _RARE_ in most regions . STO
* _RARE_ of registered persons in four _RARE_ classes were counted each year . STO
* In addition , demographic inquiries , supposedly involving field investigations , were conducted in selected minor divisions ( _RARE_ ) containing about 3 percent of the total population . STO
* The results of these inquiries were used to adjust _RARE_ of data from the _RARE_ and to provide various ratios and rates by districts , including birth and death rates , general fertility rates , distributions by _RARE_ status , fertility of _RARE_ separately in _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , infant _RARE_ , and _RARE_ .

* The areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials , supposedly as representative of a larger population . STO
* _RARE_ of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population . STO
* The scheme , in theory , is an ingenious adaptation of European registration systems to the conditions of African life . STO
* But it places a severe strain on the administrative resources ( already _RARE_ in other ways ) of a widely dispersed , poor and largely _RARE_ population . STO
* The sampling program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies . STO
* The system was not well _RARE_ to conditions of life in urban centers . STO
* The distinction between _RARE_ ( de _RARE_ ) and present ( de _RARE_ ) population was not clearly defined . STO
* So the results are subject to considerable confusion . STO
* The system tended to break down during the war , but was _RARE_ ; ; it had reached the _RARE_ level of efficiency by 1951 . STO
* In spite of the _RARE_ in this system , the figures on total population during the late _RARE_ and again in the early _RARE_ seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate _RARE_ . STO
* But the information on the _RARE_ of population was often quite _RARE_ . STO
* The same system , with minor _RARE_ , was developed in Ruanda-Urundi under _RARE_ administration . STO
* Here again it seems that useful _RARE_ of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late _RARE_ and early post-war periods . STO
* Before considering more recent activities , we should note another important aspect of _RARE_ in _RARE_ Africa . STO
* A number of strong independent agencies , established in some cases with governmental or royal support , have conducted large medical , social , educational and research operations in particular parts of the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi . STO
* The work of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Du Congo _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) has special interest with respect to _RARE_ . STO
* This agency accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from _RARE_ persons in 1941 to _RARE_ in 1956 in the _RARE_ District and adjacent areas east of _RARE_ . STO
* Each year from 1941 on , its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and , as its primary objective , the _RARE_ of major diseases . STO
* Its findings are reported each year in its _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* _RARE_ similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas . STO
* Other independent , or partially independent agencies , have promoted investigations on _RARE_ directly or indirectly related to _RARE_ . STO
* These studies vary widely in scope and precision . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ La _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) has sponsored _RARE_ field investigations and has _RARE_ closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi in the development of its official statistics . STO
* A massive investigation of the characteristics of _RARE_ and prospective _RARE_ in Ruanda-Urundi is being carried on by J. J. _RARE_ , former Director of the Social Science branch of _RARE_ , now a _RARE_ at _RARE_ _RARE_ Du Congo _RARE_ et Du Ruanda-Urundi . STO
* Some _RARE_ completed schedules with 20 items ( collected by _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ ) have been _RARE_ . STO
* The results are now being analyzed . STO
* _RARE_ have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs . STO
* The AIMO organizations of both countries , which maintain administrative services throughout the _RARE_ , retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information . STO
* However , the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics . STO
* A Bureau De La _RARE_ ( A. _RARE_ , Director ) was formed under AIMO in the Congo , to work in close _RARE_ with the Section _RARE_ of the _RARE_ General . STO
* Eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central _RARE_ Office . STO
* The 1952 demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi was directed by V. _RARE_ , a member of the _RARE_ staff , though the inquiry was carried out under the _RARE_ of AIMO , which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory . STO
* A member of the _RARE_ staff ( E. Van De _RARE_ ) was recently _RARE_ to _RARE_ with AIMO in the development of demographic statistics in this territory . STO
* The _RARE_ of sampling _RARE_ in Ruanda-Urundi ( 1952 ) and in the Congo ( 1955 - _RARE_ ) were major advances . STO
* We will deal first with the program in the Congo though this was put into operation later than the other . STO
* The radical nature of the _RARE_ in the Congo was not emphasized in the official _RARE_ . STO
* The term _RARE_ _RARE_ , previously used for the supplementary investigations carried out in connection with the administrative _RARE_ , was used for the new investigations . STO
* However , the differences in procedure are fundamental . STO
* These are as follows : ( 1 ) field work procedures . STO
* Field operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of full-time African investigators ( three teams , each working in two _RARE_ ) . STO
* These teams carried out the same operations _RARE_ in different areas . STO
* ( 2 ) nature of the sample . STO
* _RARE_ areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory , so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within _RARE_ limits . STO
* In short , scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling . STO
* The populations of the various districts , or other major divisions , were _RARE_ by type of community ( rural , urban , mixed ) and , where appropriate , by _RARE_ _RARE_ and by type of economy . STO
* _RARE_ units ( _RARE_ in rural areas , houses in cities ) were drawn systematically within these _RARE_ . STO
* ( 3 ) size of the sample . STO
* _RARE_ sampling ratios were applied under different conditions . STO
* _RARE_ proportions were _RARE_ in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas . STO
* About 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation , as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries . STO
* ( 4 ) questions and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ questions , _RARE_ , and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country . STO
* Data were obtained , separately , on three classes of persons : ( A ) residents , present ; ; ( B ) residents , absent ; ; and ( C ) visitors . STO
* In the reports , summary results are given for both the de _RARE_ ( A and C ) and de _RARE_ ( A and B ) populations ; ; but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the de _RARE_ population ( or , in some districts , only the de _RARE_ population ) . STO
* These changes represent , in effect , a shift from ( 1 ) an administrative compilation of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to ( 2 ) a systematic sampling census of the whole African population . STO
* The population registration system still has important functions . STO
* It supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations . STO
* It provides a frame for the sampling census . STO
* It also provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gaining force ( though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the Congo from this source in the near future ) . STO
* It is still used in making current population estimates in _RARE_ years , though the value of these estimates is open to question . STO
* Finally , it may have certain very important , less obvious values . STO
* Even though the _RARE_ may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there , they contain precise information on ages , by date of birth , for some of the persons present ( especially children in relatively stable communities ) and supplementary information ( such as records of _RARE_ status ) for many others . STO
* The quality of the census data can , therefore , be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries . STO
* Furthermore , it may be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method ( as distinguished from sampling error ) in each of these sources , on such subjects as fertility , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in conjunction . STO
* The first sampling census in the Congo extended over a _RARE_ period , 1955 - _RARE_ ; ; the results were still being processed in 1959 . STO
* It is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 , so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more _RARE_ . STO
* It is proposed that in the future complete sampling _RARE_ be carried out at _RARE_ intervals . STO
* _RARE_ already issued on the sampling census , 1955 - _RARE_ , in various areas run as follows ( using only the French and _RARE_ corresponding _RARE_ _RARE_ ) . STO
* This report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables . STO
* Other reports in identical form , but with somewhat varying content , have been issued . STO
* These area reports will be followed , according to present plans , by a summary report , which will include a detailed statement on methods . STO
* With this evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively _RARE_ the married students in his functional classes . STO
* _RARE_ the end of the _RARE_ work , he _RARE_ every married class member at great length . STO
* He found , as he had suspected , a general _RARE_ that perhaps over half of the present _RARE_ designed course was not really functional for these students . STO
* However , all admitted that the `` _RARE_ '' was not altogether lost . STO
* In their own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some _RARE_ on why certain troubles appeared from time to time . STO
* In fact , they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some `` _RARE_ '' study ; ; but they all _RARE_ to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent . STO
* All of them felt a _RARE_ need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course . STO
* A few were doubtful about the _RARE_ of an exclusive section for married students . STO
* As one of them expressed it , `` It has done me a world of good to listen to the naive questions and comments of these _RARE_ people . STO
* I can now better see just what processes _RARE_ certain actions from me in the past . STO
* Had I been in an _RARE_ section I would have missed this , and I believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me '' . STO
* This comment and others similar to it , would seem to indicate a possible _RARE_ for continuing the status _RARE_ . STO
* But the weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction . STO
* Thus , the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married -- that is , _RARE_ : `` marriage '' . STO
* This did not mean that married students could not _RARE_ in other `` mixed '' sections , and some of them , largely because of _RARE_ difficulties , did . STO
* But only those already married could _RARE_ in this one section . STO
* In addition , two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted . STO
* ( 1 ) The regular sections do not allow _RARE_ ; ; this one did . STO
* This action was _RARE_ on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married _RARE_ women on our campus never become _RARE_ . STO
* Many of them appear to drop out , for one reason or another . STO
* By _RARE_ _RARE_ students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it . STO
* This has subsequently been _RARE_ by the experience . STO
* ( 2 ) _RARE_ were encouraged . STO
* In the regular sections they have always been more or less _RARE_ . STO
* The philosophy has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an _RARE_ to do the work more effectively . STO
* Besides , _RARE_ do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students . STO
* But in this one section we _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Why ? STO
* For no particular reason , other than that the writer felt it might -- just might -- encourage both _RARE_ to be in _RARE_ . STO
* Many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum , especially in the various engineering fields , with few _RARE_ till the senior year . STO
* _RARE_ , it needs to be noted that because _RARE_ were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week , until at last it _RARE_ to such proportions that this `` free '' _RARE_ policy had to be _RARE_ . STO
* After that , we began to get `` visitors '' to class . STO
* This experimental class represented quite a variety of students . STO
* It ranged from a _RARE_ woman , just married , through the various academic growth stages , including one _RARE_ student , to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended . STO
* It ranged from those with no children , through students in various stages of _RARE_ , to one _RARE_ male with four children , three of whom were _RARE_ . STO
* It ranged from two women members who had experienced _RARE_ _RARE_ to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive . STO
* One might _RARE_ at this point and speculate that if it is `` wise '' to create special sections for special status , then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage , and one for _RARE_ men with _RARE_ children , and so on . STO
* Some of these _RARE_ may have some merit , others are somewhat ambiguous . STO
* But few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of _RARE_ relationships is different in marriage than in a _RARE_ situation . STO
* The writer began this special class by explaining his background thinking for creating such a section in the first place . STO
* He made it clear from the beginning that this was the _RARE_ opportunity , and that the future destiny of such groups _RARE_ on favorable results from this one . STO
* He did build a framework of academic `` _RARE_ '' , and one which did not _RARE_ upon the `` sacred _RARE_ '' of any other existing campus course . STO
* This is to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods , nor a course in how to raise children . STO
* We already have courses covering those problems , and so on . STO
* But within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible . STO
* A steering committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and _RARE_ the direction and pace the class was taking . STO
* The writer , being _RARE_ through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students , did insist on there being included some `` _RARE_ '' material . STO
* But the greater part of semester time was actually centered around the attitudes : `` So we are married -- now how do we make the best of it '' ? STO
* Or `` How do we _RARE_ our already fine marriage '' ? STO
* _RARE_ were used , as with all sections , but with one big difference . STO
* Our campus , unfortunately , _RARE_ no films . STO
* Since they are all either _RARE_ or _RARE_ , the requested dates for their use have to be far in advance . STO
* The writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be . STO
* For example , the steering committee might announce that the group felt a _RARE_ under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it _RARE_ . STO
* Since the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning he had to go along with their decision -- after , of course , pointing out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an _RARE_ one . STO
* Thus the films seen as they came in ( coordinated for the regular sections ) , were often out of context . STO
* Nevertheless , the writer has never experienced such _RARE_ of discussion after film _RARE_ . STO
* Though it did not become known to the writer for some time , a _RARE_ group had sprung up within the class . STO
* They began to meet in the _RARE_ and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class . STO
* From a few students this group gradually increased to include over _RARE_ of those officially enrolled in the class , and many outsiders as well . STO
* Also , although only a few of the students were _RARE_ acquainted with each other in the beginning , most reported that when the semester ended their _RARE_ and _RARE_ campus _RARE_ were with members of that class . STO
* In fact , they often _RARE_ their social activities to include class members previously unknown . STO
* _RARE_ outside reading reports were handled just as in the other sections , the major difference being that there was a _RARE_ deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group . STO
* These students , although they might read various articles in popular magazines , more often chose to report on articles found in the _RARE_ . STO
* In addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles , there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read . STO
* Whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other _RARE_ which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction , the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest . STO
* Since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment , nor , as a matter of fact , in those who were continuing in `` single sections '' , he can only conclude that there must have been something `` _RARE_ '' within the specific group which caused this to occur . STO
* In the main , this course took the following _RARE_ high roads . STO
* ( 1 ) A great deal of time was spent on processes for _RARE_ _RARE_ differences . STO
* This was not a search for a `` magic formula '' , but rather an examination of basic principles _RARE_ especially to all types of communication in marriage . STO
* In short , it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive _RARE_ . STO
* Not until the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further to ( 2 ) , _RARE_ adjustment areas , such as sex , _RARE_ , religion , finance , and so on . STO
* From here they proceeded to ( 3 ) These same areas in relation to their own future family life stages , developing these to the extent of _RARE_ various crises which could be expected to _RARE_ them at some time or other . STO
* As an example of this last _RARE_ , there were some lengthy discussions centered around _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ these were concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the _RARE_ of living with the _RARE_ afterward , but the possible death of one's own _RARE_ was not _RARE_ . STO
* Since the course , one member has lost her husband . STO
* This was not a particularly _RARE_ or unexpected thing -- it was previously known to her that it might happen . STO
* But just when was an unknown , and of course the longer it did not happen , the stronger her wish and belief that it might not . STO
* Since her _RARE_ this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis . STO
* Quite frequently class members brought questions from their _RARE_ at home . STO
* These were often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them . STO
* This added a personal _RARE_ to class discussions and participation . STO
* Both sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely _RARE_ . STO
* The writer sensed a much _RARE_ and more _RARE_ discussion , especially of this one area , than ever before . STO
* He felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that _RARE_ , as a _RARE_ , is not nearly so essential for a _RARE_ female sexual experience as most males might think . STO
* This was probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time and again . STO
* On the other hand , the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always _RARE_ it with love as most women seem to do . STO
* In the _RARE_ area it could be readily observed that all felt _RARE_ to discuss things than students had previously in `` mixed '' _RARE_ status sections . STO
* Perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent . STO
* Never in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine _RARE_ discussions about the feelings of both _RARE_ during various stages of _RARE_ . STO
* There was a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of _RARE_ was represented , from a _RARE_ couple to and including every _RARE_ . STO
* In fact , we had one birth before the end of the course , and another student had to take the final _RARE_ a week early , just to be on the safe side . STO
* There was also one spontaneous _RARE_ during the semester . STO
* Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` _RARE_ '' experience . STO
* It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would _RARE_ to more liberal , _RARE_ reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting their _RARE_ about taking chances . STO
* This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . STO
* _RARE_ such as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic . STO
* _RARE_ personality inventories . STO
* The three personality inventories ( _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects . STO
* These were the same subjects who were given the _RARE_ test . STO
* Some _RARE_ had been made concerning factors R , N , I and _RARE_ on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were _RARE_ as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity . STO
* Only _RARE_ _RARE_ between the two groups at less than the _RARE_ level ( Af ) . STO
* One _RARE_ had been made about the difference in security or _RARE_ between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not . STO
* The _RARE_ had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably `` secure '' _RARE_ and `` secure '' reactors being used as the groups for comparative personality studies . STO
* It was predicted that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor I which the investigators refer to as the `` _RARE_ '' factor . STO
* All of the subjects in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups ( as defined for purposes of the personality studies ) were compared with those subjects who shifted in _RARE_ 3 , or 4 . STO
* A t test on these two groups , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , gave a `` t '' value of _RARE_ which is significant on the _RARE_ test at the level . STO
* _RARE_ individual differences _RARE_ differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study . STO
* Only _RARE_ ( 11 subjects ) gave a positive Kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concerning the phenomenon . STO
* There were _RARE_ ( 20 subjects ) who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the _RARE_ of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration . STO
* There were _RARE_ ( 10 subjects ) who shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured as to the _RARE_ of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction . STO
* Among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred . STO
* One subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax . STO
* Five subjects ( _RARE_ ) did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm , what that something was , and also were given a demonstration . STO
* Four subjects ( _RARE_ ) did not change even then but needed the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal _RARE_ reaction which some people showed while others did not . STO
* At no time was it implied by the _RARE_ that the _RARE_ initial reaction was _RARE_ . STO
* The subjects were only given information about other possibilities of `` normal '' reaction . STO
* Those who responded with an arm-elevation in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion . STO
* This information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show _RARE_ must be _RARE_ it . STO
* These subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried . STO
* The positive Kohnstamm reactivity in _RARE_ 1 ( ( the naive state ) is not adequately explained by such a concept as _RARE_ ( if _RARE_ is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal _RARE_ ) . STO
* In no way , either _RARE_ or _RARE_ , did the _RARE_ indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of _RARE_ to the voluntary contraction . STO
* Moreover , when the _RARE_ did _RARE_ those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed , the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were _RARE_ in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation . STO
* They continued to give an arm-elevation . STO
* A differential _RARE_ would have to be _RARE_ to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet _RARE_ their naive Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion . STO
* _RARE_ , the reaction of the subject in such a way as to _RARE_ to his own expectations of the outcome ( i.e. , that the _RARE_ is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction , because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction '' ) also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the _RARE_ apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose , and ( 2 ) manifestations of the phenomenon despite _RARE_ of something else happening ( e.g. , of becoming _RARE_ and maybe falling , an expectation _RARE_ _RARE_ by one of the subjects ) . STO
* A suggestion _RARE_ also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of `` normal '' reactions different from those which they gave . STO
* While they were told that there were some normal people who reacted differently than they had , they were also informed that there were other _RARE_ who reacted as they had . STO
* There was no implication made that their initial reaction ( absence of an arm-elevation ) was less preferred than the presence of _RARE_ . STO
* A more _RARE_ explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less _RARE_ and to relax , since any reaction seemed _RARE_ to the _RARE_ as `` normal '' . STO
* The naive state , _RARE_ 1 , , could therefore be viewed as an _RARE_ one for _RARE_ of the subjects in this study . STO
* They were not free to be themselves in this situation , an _RARE_ one , where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for _RARE_ behavior . STO
* _RARE_ to relax , i.e. , to be `` spontaneous '' , and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have , was not sufficiently _RARE_ until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given . STO
* While other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from _RARE_ to _RARE_ in Kohnstamm reactivity , it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to _RARE_ an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ succeeded in changing _RARE_ to _RARE_ quite strikingly in one pilot subject ( the only one with whom this technique was tried ) . STO
* This subject , who has been undergoing _RARE_ _RARE_ for five years , did not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction under any of the four _RARE_ conditions used in this experiment while sober . STO
* After two drinks containing alcohol , her arm flew upward very freely . STO
* There was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement . STO
* She described herself as having the same kind of `` _RARE_ '' feeling as she had once experienced under _RARE_ . STO
* She _RARE_ her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily _RARE_ from her the controls which she felt so _RARE_ necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls . STO
* Many subjects attributed differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control -- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and _RARE_ as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it . STO
* These suggested interpretations were given by the subjects _RARE_ when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had . STO
* The Kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control . STO
* They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors . STO
* They felt that they too could _RARE_ the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction . STO
* Some of those who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with control factors -- an inability to _RARE_ control _RARE_ . STO
* One subject _RARE_ asked ( after her arm had finally _RARE_ ) , `` Do you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down before '' ? STO
* Another said that her arm did not go up at first `` because I wouldn't let it ; ; I thought it wasn't supposed to '' . STO
* This subject was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first . STO
* She had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial , but had consciously prevented it from so doing . STO
* She explained _RARE_ of others by saying that they were `` not letting themselves relax '' . STO
* When informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up , she commented , `` I don't see how they can prevent it '' . STO
* In contrast to this _RARE_ explanation for _RARE_ given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects , the Kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an _RARE_ hypothesis to explain _RARE_ . STO
* They felt that they were _RARE_ as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level . STO
* The above discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in _RARE_ in the Kohnstamm-positive subjects ; ; but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with _RARE_ . STO
* One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows : `` You feel they're going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's what's supposed to happen '' . STO
* She then described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she _RARE_ control . STO
* However , she was able to relax and yield to the moment . STO
* It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less _RARE_ about _RARE_ control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects ; ; that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors . STO
* It is our belief that this readiness to _RARE_ some control was evidenced by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below . STO
* Thus , this readiness to relax controls , evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation , appears to be a more general personality factor . STO
* _RARE_ illusion The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be _RARE_ to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world . STO
* There was a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it remained _RARE_ on the _RARE_ . STO
* This occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going _RARE_ . STO
* They knew that their _RARE_ experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Yet they were not so bound by past experience and _RARE_ as to deny their immediate _RARE_ and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be . STO
* The change in _RARE_ by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects , after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions , suggests that their _RARE_ and _RARE_ is associated with their general mode of _RARE_ to strange or unknown situations . STO
* They were able to experience at first , in terms of past _RARE_ . STO
* When informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions , they were then able to experience the _RARE_ of the present . STO
* It might be _RARE_ that these subjects are _RARE_ afraid of being wrong ; ; that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as `` threatening '' until they are tested and proved otherwise . STO
* While the interpretations that have been given are _RARE_ only , they gain support from such comments as the following , which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not , on the first trial , perceive the _RARE_ illusion . STO
* Control of _RARE_ status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method . STO
* The structured schools were in an industrial city , with _RARE_ _RARE_ houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather _RARE_ section of middle-class homes . STO
* The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly _RARE_ to _RARE_ class , but _RARE_ by an industrial area . STO
* In order to equate the samples on _RARE_ status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of _RARE_ status of the neighborhoods . STO
* School _RARE_ and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . STO
* An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . STO
* _RARE_ proportions of children in each city were drawn from _RARE_ and _RARE_ class neighborhoods . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ differences in _RARE_ and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement . STO
* Therefore , _RARE_ children were chosen as subjects for this study . STO
* For purposes of sample selection only ( individual tests were given later ) we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire _RARE_ population in each school system . STO
* The subjects for this study were _RARE_ selected from _RARE_ areas of the distribution , _RARE_ as _RARE_ , _RARE_ medium , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total _RARE_ school population were considered _RARE_ for the purposes of sample selection . STO
* _RARE_ were at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system . STO
* The final sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ in twelve unstructured schools furnished _RARE_ cases , _RARE_ boys and _RARE_ girls . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ in three structured schools furnished 72 cases , 36 boys and 36 girls . STO
* _RARE_ restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools . STO
* It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation . STO
* _RARE_ scale of compulsivity An interview schedule of _RARE_ questions and a _RARE_ questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home . STO
* The parent was asked to describe the child's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe _RARE_ toward _RARE_ in demands upon self and others , _RARE_ _RARE_ to rules , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and need for certainty . STO
* The _RARE_ were instructed not to suggest answers and , as much as possible , to record the _RARE_ actual words as they described the child's behavior in home situations . STO
* The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first _RARE_ the interview records , _RARE_ all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records . STO
* _RARE_ ratings were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual _RARE_ recorded and _RARE_ weight values to each type of behavior that was _RARE_ from the discovered norms . STO
* Children _RARE_ high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or _RARE_ in situations where there was lack of organization or _RARE_ to standards and expectations , or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals . STO
* The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively _RARE_ about such matters . STO
* For instance , the following statement was _RARE_ low in compulsivity , `` She's naturally quite neat about things , but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets _RARE_ . STO
* But she _RARE_ it up very well when I _RARE_ her '' . STO
* _RARE_ of anxiety _RARE_ , et al revised the Taylor _RARE_ Scale for use with children . STO
* The Taylor Scale was _RARE_ from the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , with item selection based upon clinical _RARE_ of anxiety . STO
* There is much research evidence to _RARE_ the use of the instrument in _RARE_ individuals who are likely to _RARE_ anxiety in varying degrees . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ work with the _RARE_ _RARE_ Scale by _RARE_ , et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale . STO
* Although the Taylor Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by _RARE_ trained workers who established _RARE_ and _RARE_ the children in reading the items . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ to compulsivity The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . STO
* The two ratings yield a correlation of , which is not significantly different from zero ; ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . STO
* In theory , compulsive behavior is a way of _RARE_ anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the _RARE_ defenses are not sufficient to _RARE_ the amount of anxiety they suffer . STO
* The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later . STO
* _RARE_ measurement In the primary grades , reading _RARE_ almost every aspect of school progress , and the children's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively _RARE_ throughout the following years . STO
* In establishing _RARE_ measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself . STO
* The predicted interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ Test , Form J , was administered by classroom teachers , consisting of a battery of six _RARE_ : _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* All of these _RARE_ involve reading except _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ are stated in _RARE_ on a national _RARE_ . STO
* The battery _RARE_ _RARE_ was used in data analysis in this study . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ Scale For Children was administered to each sample _RARE_ child by a clinical worker . STO
* The relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a _RARE_ fact ( in this case , Af ) ; ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor . STO
* The _RARE_ score used in the statistical analysis is an index of _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* It is the discrepancy between the actual _RARE_ achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I.Q. . STO
* For example , on the basis of the regression equation , a child with an I.Q. of _RARE_ in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of _RARE_ ( grade equivalent ) . STO
* If a child with an I.Q. of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in achievement , his discrepancy score would be , representing of one year of _RARE_ . STO
* A child with an I.Q. of _RARE_ would be expected to earn an achievement test score of _RARE_ . STO
* If such a child _RARE_ _RARE_ , his discrepancy score would be _RARE_ , representing of one year of _RARE_ . STO
* In this manner , the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled , allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables . STO
* Results test of interaction of compulsivity and teaching methods Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable . STO
* Figure 1 _RARE_ the mean achievement scores of each _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* First of all , as we had _RARE_ , the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better ( Af ) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools . STO
* It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools , the high compulsive children do better ( Af ) . STO
* No significant difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school . STO
* The hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported , in this case , at the level . STO
* While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high _RARE_ within the schools where the _RARE_ method is used in beginning reading _RARE_ favorably with that of the low _RARE_ . STO
* Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant . STO
* We speculate that _RARE_ in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of _RARE_ in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to _RARE_ the _RARE_ rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment . STO
* It is interesting to note that medium _RARE_ in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) . STO
* _RARE_ their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure . STO
* Our _RARE_ is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child _RARE_ those elements of each lesson that aid him in _RARE_ his work . STO
* When helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success . STO
* Test of interaction of anxiety and teaching methods The statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the _RARE_ of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4 . STO
* Figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group . STO
* As predicted , the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly ( Af ) than those in the structured schools . STO
* The interaction effect , which is significant at the level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores . STO
* While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( Af ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom . STO
* The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked _RARE_ in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . STO
* According to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that _RARE_ _RARE_ for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . STO
* The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or _RARE_ these children exhibit . STO
* The child with high anxiety may first direct his _RARE_ energy toward achievement , but because his _RARE_ severely _RARE_ the _RARE_ of discrimination and _RARE_ of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the _RARE_ in performance is pronounced . STO
* The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination . STO
* But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple . STO
* As shown earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his _RARE_ of simple elements . STO
* Success _RARE_ the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved . STO
* By the time the child first _RARE_ the actual problem of reading , he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words . STO
* Apparently academic challenge in the structured setting _RARE_ an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an _RARE_ state without becoming confused or _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ et al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the _RARE_ situation , and that his performance will be _RARE_ unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher . STO
* Although the present study was not a direct _RARE_ of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion . STO
* _RARE_ , in the two school systems studied here , judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more _RARE_ and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting . STO
* Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous _RARE_ only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting . STO
* Analysis Analysis means the evaluation of _RARE_ , the comparative ratings of parts , the _RARE_ of the meaning of isolated elements . STO
* Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and _RARE_ good parts . STO
* _RARE_ purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . STO
* _RARE_ can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . STO
* For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . STO
* Examples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving _RARE_ of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . STO
* One should keep in mind that many of the exciting _RARE_ of roleplaying are largely _RARE_ and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . STO
* _RARE_ The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of _RARE_ due to _RARE_ or _RARE_ performance was too high . STO
* It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired -- and only one was hired out of every seven _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ was offered as a solution -- and the procedure worked as follows : all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work out . STO
* In place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires , _RARE_ their references , _RARE_ them , asking them to be tried out , he told them he would prefer to test them . STO
* Each person was to enter the testing room , carrying a suitcase of samples . STO
* Each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product . STO
* In the testing room he was to make , _RARE_ , three _RARE_ to three different people . STO
* In the testing room , three of the veteran salesmen served as _RARE_ . STO
* One handled the salesman in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a _RARE_ manner . STO
* Each was told to purchase material if he felt like it . STO
* The _RARE_ came in , one at a time , and did not see or hear the other _RARE_ . STO
* After each presentation , the _RARE_ wrote his judgment of the salesmen ; ; and so did the observers consisting of the president , three of his salesmen and a _RARE_ . STO
* Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon . STO
* This procedure was repeated one day a month for four months . STO
* The batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three . STO
* The president of the firm , _RARE_ expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped _RARE_ while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent . STO
* The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers . STO
* They were , in a sense , `` tried out '' in realistic situations . STO
* From the point of view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated -- and they got a meal out of it as well as some _RARE_ into their performances . STO
* Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special _RARE_ during the daily course of work . STO
* The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher _RARE_ and slightly higher salary than typing and _RARE_ positions . STO
* All applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist . STO
* At the end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one at a time , asked them to sit behind the _RARE_ desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of _RARE_ and for a number of purposes . STO
* Each girl was independently `` tested '' by the personnel man , and he served not only as the director , but as the _RARE_ and the observer . STO
* _RARE_ to his surprise he found that one girl , whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat _RARE_ and also had been in the office a relatively short time , did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist , showing wit , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day . STO
* Analysis In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning . STO
* Some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure . STO
* An engineer had been made the works manager of a firm , _RARE_ a retired employee who had been considered _RARE_ successful . STO
* The engineer had more than seven years of experience in the firm , was well trained , was considered a hard worker , was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* However , he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position . STO
* He seemed to _RARE_ everyone . STO
* _RARE_ rates of personnel went up , production dropped , and morale was _RARE_ reduced . STO
* Despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer , he seemed to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him . STO
* At the insistence of his own _RARE_ -- the president of the firm -- he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders . STO
* He played a number of typical situations before observers , other _RARE_ who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong . STO
* _RARE_ concerned with efficiency , he was _RARE_ in _RARE_ people who made _RARE_ , _RARE_ them to too great an extent . STO
* He did not really listen to others , had little interest in their ideas , and wanted to have his own way -- which was the only right way . STO
* The entire group of managers explained , in great detail , a number of human relations errors that he made . STO
* One by one , these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors . STO
* He admitted his behavior , and _RARE_ it . STO
* He refused to change his approach , and instead he attacked high and low -- the officials for their not backing him , and _RARE_ for their _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* After the _RARE_ , he left the course , convinced that it could do him no good . STO
* We may say that his problem was _RARE_ but that he refused treatment . STO
* The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life -- and refused to change it . STO
* We may say that his attitude was foolish , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; ; or we may say that his attitude was _RARE_ , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others . STO
* In any case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made over . STO
* Another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis . STO
* In a course for _RARE_ operators , a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being _RARE_ successful as a store manager , found that in _RARE_ other managers he was having a difficult time . STO
* On playing some typical situations before a jury of his _RARE_ he showed some characteristics _RARE_ as _RARE_ . STO
* He was told he _RARE_ , for example , a sense of _RARE_ -- and he answered : `` Well , I am supposed to know all the answers , aren't I '' ? STO
* He was _RARE_ for his _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- and he answered : `` I am not working to become popular '' . STO
* On being _RARE_ for his arbitrary behavior -- he answered : `` I have to make decisions . STO
* That's my job '' . STO
* In short , as frequently happens in analyses , the individual feels threatened and _RARE_ himself . STO
* However , in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways . STO
* The necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms . STO
* How this was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem . STO
* The director helped _RARE_ a check list of the district _RARE_ errors by asking various observers to write out sentences _RARE_ on the _RARE_ they felt he made . STO
* These errors were then collected and written on a _RARE_ , _RARE_ similar ideas . STO
* _RARE_ errors were located , and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors . STO
* They were asked to vote `` true '' if they thought they had seen him make the error , `` false '' if they thought he had not ; ; and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain . STO
* The manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up , and the director wrote the numbers on the _RARE_ . STO
* No comments were made during the voting . STO
* The results looked as follows : Af . STO
* The first eight of these eighteen statements , which received at least _RARE_ of the votes , were _RARE_ to form an analysis _RARE_ for the particular manager , and when this particular manager _RARE_ in other situations , the members checked any items that appeared . STO
* To prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions , they were rather lengthy ( about twenty minutes ) , the situations were _RARE_ described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect , new _RARE_ were brought on the scene unexpectedly , and the _RARE_ were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously _RARE_ . STO
* After every session , the check marks were _RARE_ up and _RARE_ , and in this way the _RARE_ progress was _RARE_ . STO
* Summary In life we learn to play our roles and we `` _RARE_ '' into patterns which become so _RARE_ that we are not really aware of what we do . STO
* We can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves , and others can see us better than we see ourselves . STO
* To learn what we do is the first step for improvement . STO
* To accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step . STO
* To want to change is the third step . STO
* To practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant _RARE_ is the fourth step . STO
* To use these new ways in daily life is the last step . STO
* _RARE_ used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training . STO
* When an _RARE_ situation is set up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation . STO
* _RARE_ can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a _RARE_ fashion . STO
* This behavior is more `` _RARE_ '' -- or true -- than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning . STO
* While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure . STO
* Chapter 10 , _RARE_ training the objective of this chapter is to _RARE_ the _RARE_ between _RARE_ theory and other training concepts . STO
* In addition , the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed . STO
* The goal will be to provide the reader with an _RARE_ _RARE_ to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area . STO
* The reasons for _RARE_ this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are _RARE_ . STO
* 1 . STO
* _RARE_ training theory is unique and relatively new . STO
* It is not easy for the therapist to _RARE_ when , in the patient's _RARE_ , an _RARE_ has appeared and is holding _RARE_ . STO
* One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his _RARE_ suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , _RARE_ . STO
* The content of his words may _RARE_ back into _RARE_ repetition , as if a _RARE_ needle were stuck in one _RARE_ ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously _RARE_ some _RARE_ _RARE_ , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . STO
* One hebephrenic woman often became _RARE_ in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of _RARE_ , during which , despite her _RARE_ _RARE_ and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . STO
* Eventually such _RARE_ became more _RARE_ , and more sharply _RARE_ from her _RARE_ behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ? STO
* At first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her _RARE_ , in their distant _RARE_ . STO
* Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she _RARE_ my hunch . STO
* At another phase in the therapy , when a _RARE_ _RARE_ began to emerge more and more upon the _RARE_ scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! STO
* I could _RARE_ no further _RARE_ from her about this ; ; but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a _RARE_ _RARE_ tone , `` Your father _RARE_ you '' ! STO
* Again , I at first _RARE_ this _RARE_ intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak , with such _RARE_ conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased . STO
* Then I replied , coldly , `` If you _RARE_ me , why don't you say so , directly '' ? STO
* She looked confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make . STO
* It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ? STO
* She clearly agreed that this had been the case . STO
* I realized , now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her . STO
* What had been an _RARE_ powerful _RARE_ was now , despite its continuing charge of energy _RARE_ to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this _RARE_ mother was like . STO
* _RARE_ , this woman had been so filled with a _RARE_ variety of _RARE_ that at times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a _RARE_ as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would _RARE_ in various kinds of voice . STO
* A somewhat less _RARE_ hebephrenic patient of mine , who used to often _RARE_ herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door -- as I would find on passing by , between our sessions -- for all the world like two persons , a _RARE_ mother and a defensive child . STO
* _RARE_ hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is _RARE_ an _RARE_ _RARE_ to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly _RARE_ . STO
* I have found , time and again , that some bit of particularly _RARE_ and _RARE_ behavior on the part of a patient rests , in the final analysis , on this basis ; ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient's behavior . STO
* For example , one hebephrenic man used to _RARE_ me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly _RARE_ comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You're welcome '' , in a _RARE_ _RARE_ fashion -- as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing up my failure to _RARE_ a _RARE_ grateful , `` thank you '' to him at the end of each session . STO
* Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my _RARE_ to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his _RARE_ , `` You're welcome '' , was very accurately _RARE_ an element of _RARE_ _RARE_ which had been present in my own _RARE_ , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had _RARE_ him _RARE_ with the _RARE_ note , each time , that the _RARE_ Christ would be _RARE_ to _RARE_ this _RARE_ to the poor _RARE_ again on the _RARE_ . STO
* Another patient , a _RARE_ woman , for many months _RARE_ not only me but the _RARE_ and her fellow patients by _RARE_ _RARE_ as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . STO
* This behavior on her part _RARE_ only after I had come to see the _RARE_ close similarity between , on the one hand , her arranging the _RARE_ of the common living room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others , and on the other hand , my own coming _RARE_ into her room despite her persistent and _RARE_ objections , bringing my big easy chair with me , usually _RARE_ the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and _RARE_ myself down in my chair -- in short , _RARE_ as if I owned her room . STO
* 4 . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their _RARE_ expression , to some _RARE_ _RARE_ verbal or _RARE_ statement . STO
* One finds , for example , that a _RARE_ and _RARE_ verbal expression , seeming at first to be a mere hollow _RARE_ , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most _RARE_ of meanings . STO
* More than anything , it is the _RARE_ _RARE_ sensing of these _RARE_ meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a _RARE_ deck of cards , on _RARE_ occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together . STO
* One cannot assume , of course , that all these _RARE_ meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later on when the stereotype was _RARE_ ; ; probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a _RARE_ , _RARE_ mode of expression -- and no , or but a few , other _RARE_ _RARE_ , as yet -- being there , available for the patient's use , as _RARE_ emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months . STO
* But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he _RARE_ this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional _RARE_ at work in it , a _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ voices which have yet to become clearly _RARE_ from one another . STO
* Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype -- a `` How are you now '' ? STO
* Or an `` I want to go home '' , or whatever -- but a _RARE_ one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one _RARE_ meaning . STO
* A hebephrenic man used to give a _RARE_ wave of his hand a number of times during his _RARE_ hours with his therapist . STO
* When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill -- _RARE_ or farewell '' ? STO
* , the patient replied , `` Both , _RARE_ -- two in one '' . STO
* Of all the possible forms of _RARE_ expression , that which seems best to give release , and _RARE_ expression , to complex and _RARE_ feelings is laughter . STO
* It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely _RARE_ of all schizophrenic patients , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms , laughter -- laughter which now makes one feel _RARE_ or hated , which now makes one feel like _RARE_ , or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty _RARE_ of man's despair ; ; and which , more often than all these , _RARE_ a _RARE_ of feelings which could in no way be _RARE_ by any number of words , words which are so unlike this _RARE_ in being formed and discrete from one another . STO
* To a much less full extent , the hebephrenic _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ has a comparable _RARE_ function ; ; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private _RARE_ over of the possible meaning of a _RARE_ , or the passage of _RARE_ , not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these _RARE_ sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from time to time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words . STO
* As I have been _RARE_ , in the schizophrenic -- and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic ; ; this is a question which I have no wish to take up -- condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well _RARE_ out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well _RARE_ from one another . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , in their description of the _RARE_ of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the _RARE_ condensation '' . STO
* In my experience , a great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become _RARE_ from _RARE_ meanings in his subjective experience . STO
* Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some _RARE_ , _RARE_ reference to _RARE_ events on the _RARE_ scene . STO
* _RARE_ , for example , a _RARE_ woman's large-scale _RARE_ , in the session , about the _RARE_ curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a _RARE_ characteristic of _RARE_ human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was _RARE_ _RARE_ at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was . STO
* Or , equally often , a _RARE_ , _RARE_ statement may consist , with its _RARE_ _RARE_ , in a form of poetry -- may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a _RARE_ expression : a _RARE_ , a smile , an _RARE_ , or some other symbolic mode of speaking . STO
* Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more often than not , entirely unaware . STO
* His subjective experience may be a remarkably _RARE_ one . STO
* One hebephrenic women _RARE_ to me , `` I live in a world of words '' , as if , to her , words were fully concrete objects ; ; _RARE_ , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concerning schizophrenic communication , includes mention of similar clinical material . STO
* A _RARE_ schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been _RARE_ , in a most _RARE_ fashion , during session after session with me , were like great _RARE_ of almost _RARE_ solid matter up in the air above him ; ; as he spoke I was reminded of the great _RARE_ of _RARE_ which are swung , high in the air , from a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the _RARE_ contents around _RARE_ , stems , _RARE_ , etc. . STO
* A significant reduction in the _RARE_ of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly _RARE_ language such as Russian . STO
* For English the reduction in size is less striking . STO
* This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be _RARE_ into a description of the particular word . STO
* The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file . STO
* _RARE_ of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis . STO
* We suggest the application of certain _RARE_ techniques as a solution to the problem . STO
* But first , we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : form -- any unique sequence of _RARE_ characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space ; ; occurrence -- an instance of a form in text . STO
* We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text . STO
* We accomplish this by _RARE_ a list of text forms as text is read by the computer . STO
* A _RARE_ scheme , based on the _RARE_ of forms , provides an economical way to _RARE_ this text-form list . STO
* _RARE_ forms found to match forms in the text list are marked . STO
* A location in the computer store is also named for each marked form ; ; dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text . STO
* Finally , information is retrieved from the dictionary as required by stages of the translation process -- the grammatical description for _RARE_ determination , _RARE_ information for semantic analysis , and _RARE_ _RARE_ for output construction . STO
* The dictionary is a form dictionary , at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries . STO
* Also , the dictionary is divided into at least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms . STO
* A more detailed description of dictionary operations -- text lookup and dictionary _RARE_ -- gives a clearer picture . STO
* Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists of three steps . STO
* The first is _RARE_ a list of text forms , _RARE_ an information cell to each , and _RARE_ text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence . STO
* For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W-region are used for storage of the forms in the text-form list ; ; cells in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ region are reserved as information cells for text forms . STO
* When an occurrence Af is isolated during text reading , a random memory address Af , the address of a cell in the _RARE_ , is computed from the form of Af . STO
* Let Af _RARE_ the form of Af . STO
* If cell Af has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form list , it is now assigned as the information cell of Af . STO
* The form itself is stored in the next available cells of the W-region , beginning in cell Af . STO
* The address Af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in Af ; ; the information cell Af is saved to represent the text occurrence . STO
* Text reading continues with the next occurrence . STO
* Let us assume that Af is identical to the form of an occurrence Af which preceded Af in the text . STO
* When this situation exists , the address Af will equal Af which was produced from Af . STO
* If Af was assigned as the information cell for Af , the routine can detect that Af is identical to Af by comparing Af with the form stored at location Af . STO
* The address Af is stored in the cell Af . STO
* When , as in this case , the two forms match , the address Af is saved to represent the occurrence Af . STO
* Text reading continues with the next occurrence . STO
* A third situation is possible . STO
* The formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form . STO
* Thus , when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the _RARE_ , a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms , one cell in the chain for each form . STO
* If Af leads to an address Af that is equal to the address computed from Af , even though Af does not match Af , the chain of information cells is extended from Af by _RARE_ the address of the next available cell in the _RARE_ , Af , in Af . STO
* The cell Af becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of Af . STO
* A third cell can be added by _RARE_ the address of another _RARE_ in Af ; ; similarly , as many cells are added as are required . STO
* Each information cell in the chain contains the address of the _RARE_ where the form to which it is assigned is stored . STO
* Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the _RARE_ that is the next element of the chain ; ; the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain . STO
* Hence , when the address Af is computed from Af , the cell Af and all _RARE_ in its chain must be _RARE_ to determine whether Af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain . STO
* When the information cell for Af has been determined , it is saved as a representation of Af . STO
* Text reading continues with the next occurrence . STO
* Text reading is _RARE_ when a _RARE_ number of forms have been stored in the text-form list . STO
* This _RARE_ the second step of _RARE_ lookup -- _RARE_ the information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms . STO
* Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list . STO
* Each time a dictionary form matches a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is saved . STO
* The number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved . STO
* These two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage . STO
* If each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read . STO
* The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time . STO
* Each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading . STO
* A random address Af that lies within the _RARE_ of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the _RARE_ dictionary form . STO
* If cell Af is an information cell , it and any information cells in the _RARE_ that have been linked to Af each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored . STO
* The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms . STO
* When a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage . STO
* If cell Af is not an information cell we conclude that the _RARE_ dictionary form is not in the text list . STO
* These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation . STO
* The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text . STO
* The list of text forms in the W-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the X and _RARE_ are no longer required . STO
* Only the assignment of the information cells is important . STO
* The first stage of translation after _RARE_ lookup is structural analysis of the input text . STO
* The grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis . STO
* A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence . STO
* The grammatical descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file . STO
* The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe . STO
* When entries are being retrieved from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to _RARE_ and which entries to store in the computer . STO
* This _RARE_ process takes place as the file is read . STO
* Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj . STO
* The address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form . STO
* ( The address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage . STO
* ) When the complete file has been read , the grammatical descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the W-region ; ; the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents . STO
* Hence , the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of _RARE_ _RARE_ addresses and _RARE_ the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence . STO
* The only requirements on dictionary information made by the _RARE_ operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms . STO
* This leaves the ordering of entries variable . STO
* ( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it . STO
* ) Two very useful ways for _RARE_ a _RARE_ are the addition to the dictionary of complete _RARE_ rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form . STO
* The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage . STO
* The latter is useful for _RARE_ information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents . STO
* _RARE_ the techniques developed at _RARE_ for generating a _RARE_ from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once . STO
* An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatical description of each form . STO
* _RARE_ could be assigned to the _RARE_ either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context . STO
* Thus , one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form . STO
* If all forms of a _RARE_ are _RARE_ together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible . STO
* For example , the _RARE_ forms of a word can be represented , _RARE_ as regular _RARE_ allows , by a stem and a set of _RARE_ to be attached . STO
* ( Indeed , the set of _RARE_ can be replaced by the name of a set of _RARE_ . STO
* ) The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list . STO
* Similarly , if the _RARE_ for the forms of a word do not vary , the _RARE_ need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form . STO
* The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such _RARE_ or designed around it . STO
* When _RARE_ and variation prevent _RARE_ , information is written in complete detail . STO
* _RARE_ are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased . STO
* In sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . STO
* The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . STO
* There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Thus the first lines of one of Charles _RARE_ _RARE_ are as follows . STO
* `` A charge to keep I have , A God to _RARE_ '' . STO
* In the tune to which this _RARE_ is most often sung , `` _RARE_ '' , the syllables have and _RARE_ , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . STO
* _RARE_ stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to _RARE_ would normally center on its first _RARE_ rather than its last . STO
* But the parallel is significant . STO
* When the answer to what's wrong now ? STO
* Is _RARE_ broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair . STO
* From the point of view of _RARE_ analysis the head word in the statement is the _RARE_ has broken , and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking ; ; but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional _RARE_ of the sentence . STO
* In I know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; ; in one thing I know it will usually be on the _RARE_ know . STO
* In _RARE_ people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; ; in the double sentence the smaller the town , the _RARE_ the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people . STO
* In what's a linguist ? STO
* dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist ; ; in who's a linguist ? STO
* it will generally be on the complement a linguist . STO
* _RARE_ stress is on her luggage both in that's her luggage , where her luggage is the complement , and in there's her luggage , where it is the subject . STO
* _RARE_ second _RARE_ , however , are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences . STO
* If the answer to what was that noise ? STO
* Is George put the cat out , dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement , the cat , not the second complement out . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ may or may not have dominant stress . STO
* If the answer to what was that noise ? STO
* Is George _RARE_ the news emotionally , dominant stress may or may not be on the _RARE_ emotionally . STO
* When _RARE_ _RARE_ are divided as in what are you looking for ? STO
* They are likely to lose dominant stress . STO
* _RARE_ is of extreme importance . STO
* What is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not . STO
* Thus in a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new , dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows here , but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow , dominant stress will probably be on snows . STO
* The personal _RARE_ and substitute one are normally _RARE_ because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context . STO
* In I'll go with George dominant stress is probably on George ; ; but if George has just been mentioned prominently ( and the trip to be made has been under discussion ) , what is said is probably I'll go with him , and dominant stress is probably on the _RARE_ with . STO
* When a gesture _RARE_ who's he ? STO
* the personal _RARE_ has dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously . STO
* If both George and a piece of information George does not have are prominent in the context , but the idea of telling George is new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell George ? STO
* But when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious , there is normally only light stress or no stress at all . STO
* Thus the _RARE_ it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from its use with snows : nothing can snow snow but `` it '' . STO
* In there aren't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious . STO
* If women replaced people , it would normally have dominant stress . STO
* In I have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has _RARE_ stress than do . STO
* If work is substituted for things ( with more exact contribution to meaning ) , it will have dominant stress . STO
* In I know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to _RARE_ pale thing . STO
* In I knew you when you were a child , and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty . STO
* _RARE_ stress on pretty would be almost _RARE_ here . STO
* In the written language then can be _RARE_ or _RARE_ to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written language simply depends on the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ reader will have to back up and _RARE_ . STO
* Often , dominant stress simply indicates a _RARE_ of attention or emotion . STO
* Thus in it's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress is likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress also . STO
* In she has it in for George dominant stress will ordinarily be on in , where the notion of _RARE_ _RARE_ seems to center . STO
* In we're painting at our garage strong stress on at indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting . STO
* Where there is comparison or contrast , dominant stresses normally operate to center attention . STO
* Thus in his friends are stranger than his _RARE_ strong stresses are normal for his and _RARE_ , but in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters . STO
* In he's _RARE_ himself more than he's _RARE_ you both himself and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast . STO
* In is she _RARE_ or Japanese ? STO
* The desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last components produces an exceptional _RARE_ of the normal patterns of stress of _RARE_ and Japanese . STO
* Sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship . STO
* Thus in Mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on Mary marks Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip , strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of Mary's concerned with an account of her trip ( about which she may later have made speeches , for example ) , and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which Mary wrote accounts . STO
* In hunger _RARE_ man too the situation is very similar . STO
* Strong stress on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus , strong stress on _RARE_ treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger , strong stress on man treats man as an additional creature who _RARE_ to the stimulation of hunger . STO
* Here again , in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using _RARE_ or _RARE_ , but much of the time there is simply _RARE_ on his understanding in the light of context . STO
* When a word represents a larger construction of which it is the only expressed part , it normally has more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction . STO
* Thus when yes , I have is the response to have you finished reading the paper ? STO
* The stress on have , which here represents have finished reading the paper , is quite strong . STO
* In _RARE_ the leader at camp , but Jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents is the leader and therefore has stress . STO
* _RARE_ the leader at camp , but Jack's here , with this is deprived of stress , makes here the complement in the clause . STO
* In of all the suggestions that were made , his was the _RARE_ the _RARE_ his represents his suggestion and is stressed . STO
* When go represents itself and a complement ( being equivalent , say , to go to _RARE_ ) in which boat did Jack go on ? STO
* It has strong stress ; ; when it represents only itself and on which is its complement ( so that go on is _RARE_ equivalent to board ) , on has stronger stress than go does . STO
* _RARE_ of a _RARE_ _RARE_ , however , does not result in an increase in stress on a _RARE_ _RARE_ for which the _RARE_ _RARE_ would be object . STO
* Thus to has light stress both in that was the conclusion that I came to and in that was the conclusion I came to . STO
* But when to represents to consciousness in that was the moment that I came to , and similarly in that was the moment I came to , there is much stronger stress on to . STO
* In I wanted to tell him , but I was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him . STO
* In to tell him , of course , to is normally _RARE_ . STO
* When I have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions that I am to leave this place , dominant stress is ordinarily on leave . STO
* When the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions which I am to leave , dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions . STO
* It is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction _RARE_ in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written . STO
* Other examples follow . STO
* `` I'll come by Tuesday . STO
* I can't be happy long without drinking water '' . STO
* In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an _RARE_ of time equivalent to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language ; ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a _RARE_ unit used as an _RARE_ , by will be _RARE_ or lightly stressed at most . STO
* In the second sentence if drinking water is a _RARE_ clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; ; but if drinking is a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ water and without drinking water is equivalent to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water . STO
* But the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for example , can _RARE_ _RARE_ such as these . STO
* And patterns of stress are not always _RARE_ by any means . STO
* In the _RARE_ have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is _RARE_ a second complement in the first sentence and a _RARE_ followed by its object in the second . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* -- _RARE_ are linguistic units _RARE_ in _RARE_ which are usually _RARE_ but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding andor following _RARE_ or combinations of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ are genuine units , but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties . STO
* Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear . STO
* _RARE_ on this point is strongest before l and _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* From the point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ is the _RARE_ that is employed also in _RARE_ , and al is the common _RARE_ . STO
* When _RARE_ is added , real clearly has two syllables . STO
* But there is every reason to regard deal as a _RARE_ , and because of the fact that l commonly has the quality of _RARE_ when it follows vowel sounds , deal seems to be a perfectly satisfactory _RARE_ with deal . STO
* It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* No single explanation is adequate to account for this . STO
* _RARE_ , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . STO
* The first is a _RARE_ sample of successful tonal analyses . STO
* Even beginning students in _RARE_ are made familiar with an _RARE_ variety of _RARE_ systems , both in their general _RARE_ and in many specific details . STO
* An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types . STO
* By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the _RARE_ distinction between register and contour languages . STO
* This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely _RARE_ work with tone . STO
* _RARE_ analysis will continue to be difficult and _RARE_ until a more representative selection of systems is _RARE_ to every _RARE_ field linguist . STO
* _RARE_ like these four , if widely read , will contribute _RARE_ to improvement of our analytic work . STO
* The second need is better field techniques . STO
* The great majority of _RARE_ linguists fall into one or more of a number of _RARE_ types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be _RARE_ , those who are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a _RARE_ view of the whole matter . STO
* The result has been neglect , _RARE_ efforts , or _RARE_ treatment . STO
* As these _RARE_ _RARE_ , so must the cure . STO
* _RARE_ such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple . STO
* They will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures . STO
* Good field techniques will not only _RARE_ linguists for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitudes . STO
* Actually , none of these papers says much directly about field techniques . STO
* But it is worth _RARE_ that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in _RARE_ . STO
* These things have been disseminated by other means , but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results . STO
* The third need is for better theory . STO
* We should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for _RARE_ and _RARE_ , but it has not been . STO
* This can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are _RARE_ general . STO
* If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems . STO
* One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems . STO
* Since tone systems _RARE_ comprise fewer units than either _RARE_ or vowel systems , we might expect that they would be the _RARE_ part of a phonologic analysis . STO
* _RARE_ practice does not often work out this way . STO
* _RARE_ systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often _RARE_ more difficult than much larger consonantal systems . STO
* _RARE_ has suggested one explanation . STO
* _RARE_ languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in _RARE_ use . STO
* This may both _RARE_ the attention of the _RARE_ and cause confusion for the more _RARE_ . STO
* The problem is to _RARE_ the linguistic features of pitch from the _RARE_ _RARE_ features . STO
* Of course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology : consonantal _RARE_ have both a linguistic and an individual component . STO
* But in general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude . STO
* With tone , individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are _RARE_ on them . STO
* _RARE_ differences from one speaker to another , or from one emotional state to another , may far exceed the small differences between tones . STO
* However , any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone , or in developing a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is _RARE_ recorded . STO
* A second explanation is suggested by the material described in _RARE_ paper . STO
* _RARE_ and intonation often become seriously _RARE_ . STO
* Neither can be adequately _RARE_ until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other . STO
* Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also _RARE_ or _RARE_ in this way ; ; for example , duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation . STO
* Some _RARE_ features , for example _RARE_ catch or _RARE_ , are sometimes to be assigned to _RARE_ _RARE_ and sometimes to _RARE_ systems . STO
* But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to _RARE_ as are tone and intonation in some languages . STO
* This explanation of tone difficulties , however , does not apply in all languages . STO
* In some ( the _RARE_ type mentioned above ) interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation _RARE_ . STO
* In many of the syllables , intonation can be safely ignored , and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation . STO
* Still , even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect . STO
* A third explanation is suggested by _RARE_ analysis of _RARE_ tone . STO
* There we see a basically simple phonemic system _RARE_ in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic system . STO
* While the _RARE_ can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to _RARE_ units , i.e. until the morphophonemics is worked out , or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success . STO
* In the `` typical tone language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics . STO
* The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic systems , however , are very different . STO
* The inventory of tones is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level . STO
* _RARE_ systems are not merely larger , they are _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ rules may be thought of as _RARE_ certain points in the system . STO
* The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used . STO
* _RARE_ connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of _RARE_ similarity , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system . STO
* _RARE_ morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone . STO
* The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater . STO
* Often , therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules as well , having the opposite effect . STO
* _RARE_ morphophonemics is much more _RARE_ to the beginning _RARE_ than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rules is no greater . STO
* The difficulty of analysis of any _RARE_ in the phonology is an inverse function of the size -- smaller systems are more troublesome -- for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity . STO
* This hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis , as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more puzzling than consonantal systems . STO
* The statement of the system is a different matter . STO
* _RARE_ systems can of course be stated much more _RARE_ . STO
* A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics . STO
* And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic system will be _RARE_ without close attention to the morphophonemics -- at least , the less _RARE_ will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to _RARE_ meaningful structures . STO
* The design of _RARE_ has received much less attention from linguists than the problem _RARE_ . STO
* There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic _RARE_ will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance . STO
* This seems naive . STO
* Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the _RARE_ and most obvious features of the phonology when _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be _RARE_ in technical _RARE_ of possible _RARE_ interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs . STO
* The result of this attitude has been the _RARE_ of many orthography conferences by such considerations as _RARE_ ' _RARE_ ' , which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain _RARE_ carried over from European languages . STO
* Many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most _RARE_ relationship to the language structures that they _RARE_ to represent . STO
* _RARE_ have not always been more _RARE_ than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on _RARE_ trivial points while _RARE_ things of much greater significance . STO
* As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion . STO
* A. E. _RARE_ , in _RARE_ And _RARE_ In _RARE_ , _RARE_ one set of related _RARE_ questions and its phonologic background in detail . STO
* His objective is merely to determine `` what _RARE_ of length and _RARE_ it may be desirable to make explicit in a _RARE_ orthography '' ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* To do so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail . STO
* In the process , he _RARE_ some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult . STO
* A few of his examples are of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory . STO
* His _RARE_ recommendations are no _RARE_ acceptance of _RARE_ on the one hand or of _RARE_ on the other . STO
* Rather he _RARE_ each phonologic fact in the light of its _RARE_ usefulness . STO
* He _RARE_ that some changes can be made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but _RARE_ to suggest precise _RARE_ devices to effect these changes . STO
* I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in _RARE_ circles . STO
* This , however , will not _RARE_ their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design . STO
* We need many more studies of this sort if the design of written languages is to be put on a sound basis . STO
* One other paper deals with a phonologic problem : _RARE_ Harmony In _RARE_ , by J. _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ the already widely known facts in terms of _RARE_ . STO
* As a _RARE_ it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of _RARE_ . STO
* But it would seem more intended as a tract _RARE_ the _RARE_ theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of _RARE_ phonology . STO
* The paper has a certain value as a _RARE_ easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it treats a fairly simple and _RARE_ phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement . STO
* It does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described . STO
* But it does not , as it claims , demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods . STO
* It seems to me that it rather easily can . STO
* Five of the papers deal with grammatical problems . STO
* On the whole they maintain much the same high standard , but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter . STO
* My comments must be _RARE_ than the papers deserve . STO
* W. H. _RARE_ _RARE_ on The _RARE_ _RARE_ In _RARE_ . STO
* This must be considered primarily an _RARE_ and supplement to his early A _RARE_ _RARE_ Of _RARE_ In _RARE_ . STO
* It exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms . STO
* The treatment seems _RARE_ _RARE_ and complex , largely because the method is _RARE_ and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent _RARE_ . STO
* There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which _RARE_ the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in _RARE_ from _RARE_ than the Yokuts languages from _RARE_ . STO
* This may be because the Athabascan _RARE_ began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . STO
* The differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows _RARE_ stems per meaning slot as against _RARE_ for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . STO
* ( On deduction of _RARE_ from _RARE_ , the stem  item rate becomes _RARE_ against _RARE_ in equivalent number of languages . STO
* ) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . STO
* The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . STO
* These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts _RARE_ were built up of terms selected mainly to insure _RARE_ of English meaning between _RARE_ _RARE_ and myself , within a _RARE_ and uniform _RARE_ area , but that _RARE_ vocabulary is based on _RARE_ second _RARE_ list which aims at eliminating all items which might be _RARE_ or geographically determined . STO
* Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically _RARE_ to the San _RARE_ Valley . STO
* The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 . STO
* Swadesh , and therefore _RARE_ , felt compelled to _RARE_ all terms _RARE_ species or even _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , yellow pine , _RARE_ ) ; ; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to _RARE_ or _RARE_ parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) . STO
* The groups are therefore really _RARE_ in content as well as in size . STO
* Other classes are included only by myself ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) or only by Swadesh and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) . STO
* What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body parts and products , which with a _RARE_ nearly even representation ( _RARE_ terms out of _RARE_ , 25 out of 100 ) come out with nearly even ratios ; ; _RARE_ and _RARE_ ; ; ( 2 ) _RARE_ ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios _RARE_ versus _RARE_ ; ; ( 3 ) _RARE_ ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios _RARE_ versus _RARE_ ; ; ( 4 ) verbs ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios _RARE_ versus _RARE_ . STO
* It will be seen that where the scope is similar , the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of _RARE_ as against _RARE_ or 4 : 5 ) except for verbs , where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower . STO
* This exception may be connected with _RARE_ use of a much higher percentage of verbs : _RARE_ of his total list as against _RARE_ in mine . STO
* Or the exception may be due to a particular _RARE_ peculiar to the Athabascan _RARE_ . STO
* More word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question . STO
* 5 . STO
* If word classes differ in their resistance or _RARE_ to stem replacement within meaning slot , it is _RARE_ that individual meanings also differ with fair _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several _RARE_ like _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) . STO
* For Yokuts , I _RARE_ these 71 items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems . STO
* The _RARE_ for these five categories are not too _RARE_ , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively . STO
* For Athabascan , with a greater range of stems , the first two of five corresponding columns were identical , 1 and 2 stems ; ; the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively Af ; ; Af ; ; and Af stems . STO
* While the particular limits of these _RARE_ may seem _RARE_ arbitrary , they do fairly express a corresponding _RARE_ of more variable material , and they _RARE_ also in five classes , along a similar scale , containing approximately equal numbers of cases , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in Athabascan . STO
* When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families _RARE_ in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : Af . STO
* This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : Af ; ; which , divided by Af gives a mean of _RARE_ grades apart . STO
* If the distribution of the 71 items were wholly _RARE_ in the two families , the distance would of course be 0 . STO
* If it were wholly random and _RARE_ , it would be _RARE_ , assuming the five classes were equal in _RARE_ , which approximately they are . STO
* The actual mean of _RARE_ being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and _RARE_ of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as _RARE_ long-term stem displacement . STO
* 6 . STO
* In 1960 , David D. Thomas published Basic _RARE_ In some _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 2 , No. 3 , _RARE_ 7 - 11 ) , which _RARE_ 8 _RARE_ languages with the _RARE_ language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate ( Af ) in place of original ( Af ) , and his revised 100 word basic _RARE_ list in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 21 : : _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) . STO
* _RARE_ findings are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and _RARE_ in their persistence '' ; ; but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly _RARE_ in their average persistence '' ( as between _RARE_ and _RARE_ ) . STO
* His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on _RARE_ and _RARE_ ) was partially positive . STO
* His second conclusion , on semantic word classes , agrees with mine . STO
* This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored . STO
* Thomas also presents a simple equation for _RARE_ an index of persistence , which weights not only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative frequency . STO
* Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning are : stem identical in 8 languages , _RARE_ ; ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , _RARE_ ; ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , _RARE_ ; ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , _RARE_ . STO
* His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material . STO
* But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with _RARE_ and _RARE_ relevance ; ; and _RARE_ presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area . STO
* As to relative frequencies of competing roots ( 7 - 1 _RARE_ 4 - 4 , etc. ) , Thomas with his ' _RARE_ ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have . STO
* The problem needs further exploration . STO
* I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that _RARE_ publication , in which , in _RARE_ ' _RARE_ _RARE_ ' , I set off by _RARE_ those forms in which N of stem B was Af of stem _RARE_ , the _RARE_ ones standing for Af ; ; or under ' Four _RARE_ ' , I set off by _RARE_ cases where the combined N of stems Af was Af . STO
* 7 . STO
* These findings , and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method of _RARE_ inquiry . STO
* If _RARE_ meanings show relatively low _RARE_ of stems , as I am _RARE_ will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? STO
* Had _RARE_ substituted for his 15 _RARE_ _RARE_ 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller . STO
* And _RARE_ of the outcome in centuries _RARE_ since _RARE_ , calculations obviously carry more _RARE_ and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with _RARE_ unstable ones . STO
* It is evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great _RARE_ and feeling for the _RARE_ behavior of _RARE_ items . STO
* Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ? STO
* It is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible . STO
* And why that insistence ? STO
* It is the hope of _RARE_ a list of items of universal occurrence . STO
* But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a _RARE_ . STO
* Not that such a list cannot be constructed ; ; but the nearer it comes to _RARE_ _RARE_ , the less significant will it be _RARE_ . STO
* Its terms will tend to be _RARE_ or vague , and they will fit actual languages more and more badly . STO
* The practical operational problem of _RARE_ is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison . STO
* The most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as _RARE_ as possible . STO
* In proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better rely on their being _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* An _RARE_ or a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , _RARE_ , _RARE_ identity , as do an eye or tooth or nail . STO
* They _RARE_ out easily , naturally , and _RARE_ from the _RARE_ of nature and existence ; ; and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities . STO
* With the universal list as his weapon , Swadesh has extended his _RARE_ of _RARE_ farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve _RARE_ back . STO
* And he has proclaimed greater or less _RARE_ between all Western hemisphere languages . STO
* Some of this may prove to be true , or even considerable of it , whether by _RARE_ _RARE_ or by diffusion and _RARE_ . STO
* But the farther out he moves , the _RARE_ will be his hold on conclusive evidence , and the larger the _RARE_ component in his _RARE_ . STO
* He has _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , but he has not _RARE_ them behind him , nor does he control them . STO
* He has announced results on _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and almost all other American families and _RARE_ , and has _RARE_ their degree of _RARE_ ; ; but he has not worked out by _RARE_ one _RARE_ complete classification of even a single family other than _RARE_ . STO
* That is his privilege . STO
* The remote , _RARE_ , possible has values of its own -- values of scope , stimulus , potential , and imagination . STO
* But there is also a firm aspect to _RARE_ : the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural _RARE_ groups of languages as well as their more remote and _RARE_ external _RARE_ ; ; of classification first , with _RARE_ age merely a _RARE_ ; ; of acquiring _RARE_ knowledge of what happened in Athabascan , in Yokuts , in _RARE_ in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more _RARE_ may have happened between them . STO
* This involves _RARE_ progress , and such will have to be the _RARE_ work of _RARE_ as a growing body of scientific inquiry . STO
* If of the _RARE_ of _RARE_ Swadesh has escaped our steady _RARE_ , and _RARE_ has _RARE_ his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should _RARE_ . STO
* 8 . STO
* There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by _RARE_ rules and procedure since his _RARE_ and aims have grown so vast . STO
* It seems time to consider a _RARE_ of operational procedures for _RARE_ studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis . STO
* I would propose , first , an _RARE_ of attempts at a universal _RARE_ list , as _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ inadequate in proportion as it is achieved . STO
* I would propose , next , as the prime requirement for _RARE_ of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible . STO
* There would be no _RARE_ sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable . STO
* An attempted middle course might lead to devices like a _RARE_ _RARE_ dictionary from which every _RARE_ word was selected . STO
* _RARE_ it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . STO
* It was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former _RARE_ , and with _RARE_ Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . STO
* 5 . STO
* Poland _RARE_ . STO
* When the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of _RARE_ all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . STO
* _RARE_ in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East _RARE_ to _RARE_ , the Red _RARE_ had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the _RARE_ , thirty miles from _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ region was being rapidly _RARE_ , while the Western _RARE_ had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the _RARE_ . STO
* The long delay in opening the Second _RARE_ was now working to Russia's advantage . STO
* The West was now glad to propose the _RARE_ _RARE_ Line , which was substantially Russia's 1941 _RARE_ , as the boundary between Russia and Poland . STO
* When this proposal was made , Stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the Conference . STO
* He stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject . STO
* The bitter memory of Russia's _RARE_ from the Paris Peace Conference and of the _RARE_ effort to _RARE_ out _RARE_ at its birth _RARE_ up within him . STO
* `` You would drive us into shame '' , he declared . STO
* The White _RARE_ and the _RARE_ would say that Stalin and _RARE_ were far less reliable _RARE_ of Russia than _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Yet after long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted the _RARE_ Line and even agreed _RARE_ that there should be _RARE_ from that line of five to eight _RARE_ in favor of Poland in some regions . STO
* He did not mind the Line itself , which Churchill declared in the House of _RARE_ , on February _RARE_ , 1945 , he had always believed to be `` just and right '' , but he did not want it called by a hated name . STO
* The West had long since forgotten the events of _RARE_ , but it was not so easy for the Red leaders , who felt that they had suffered great _RARE_ in that period . STO
* In the _RARE_ _RARE_ of February 4 , 1942 , the State Department had expected to be able to hold Russia in check by withholding agreement to her 1941 boundaries . STO
* Now Stalin made it clear that he meant to move _RARE_ western _RARE_ deep into Germany , back to the western _RARE_ River lines , taking not only East _RARE_ and all of _RARE_ but _RARE_ and the tip of _RARE_ , back to and including _RARE_ . STO
* From six to nine million additional Germans would be _RARE_ , though most would have fled , and Poland would receive far more from Germany than the poor _RARE_ , including the great _RARE_ _RARE_ , which she lost to Russia . STO
* Stalin declared that he preferred to continue the war a little longer , `` although it costs us blood '' , in order to give Poland compensation in the West at the expense of the Germans . STO
* By this time Churchill was not so _RARE_ toward moving Poland _RARE_ as he had been at _RARE_ , where he and _RARE_ had both heartily approved the idea . STO
* After `` a prolonged study of the _RARE_ line on a _RARE_ '' , at _RARE_ , Churchill `` liked the picture '' . STO
* He would tell the _RARE_ , he said , that they had been `` given a fine place to live in , more than three hundred miles each way '' . STO
* At Yalta he thought more about the six million Germans who would have to leave , trying to find work in Germany , and Roosevelt _RARE_ to the Western _RARE_ River being chosen in the south , instead of the Eastern _RARE_ , both of which flow into the _RARE_ . STO
* The issue was left in _RARE_ , presumably for the peace conference . STO
* However , there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong Poland , both _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and one _RARE_ by large _RARE_ of Germans or _RARE_ . STO
* The moving of millions of the German _RARE_ , from the very heart of _RARE_ , to make room for the Polish _RARE_ whom they had _RARE_ and openly planned to _RARE_ was a _RARE_ operation , but there was little doubt that it was _RARE_ justified . STO
* Government . STO
* Of more importance to the West than _RARE_ boundaries was the character of her government . STO
* At Yalta the West still believed that Eastern Europe could be kept in its orbit , in spite of the _RARE_ Soviet _RARE_ . STO
* Though little democracy had ever been _RARE_ in this region , and much of it was still ruled by _RARE_ means , it was taken for granted that at least the forms of Western democracy would be established in this area and Western capitalism preserved within it . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions , it was important to both Roosevelt and Churchill that the _RARE_ should have them . STO
* The issue was _RARE_ because the _RARE_ Polish Government in London , supported in the main by Britain , was still competing with the new Lublin Government formed behind the Red Army . STO
* More time was spent in trying to marry these _RARE_ than over any subject discussed at Yalta . STO
* The result was an agreement that the Lublin Government should be `` _RARE_ on a broader democratic basis with the _RARE_ of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from the _RARE_ abroad '' , and _RARE_ to hold `` free and _RARE_ elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal _RARE_ and secret _RARE_ '' . STO
* All `` democratic and _RARE_ parties '' were to have the right to campaign . STO
* Roosevelt acted as _RARE_ of the long debate on this issue . STO
* It was a matter of principle with Churchill , since Britain had declared war in behalf of Poland . STO
* To Stalin it was a matter of life and death . STO
* He made this completely clear . STO
* _RARE_ with `` great _RARE_ '' , he said : `` For the Russian people , the question of Poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security . STO
* Throughout history , Poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into Russia . STO
* _RARE_ in the last thirty years our enemies , the Germans , have passed through this corridor . STO
* It is in Russia's interest that Poland should be strong and powerful , in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force . STO
* It is necessary that Poland should be free , independent in power . STO
* Therefore , it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the Soviet state '' . STO
* In other words , the Soviet Union was determined to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful _RARE_ against Germany and so closely tied to Russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a _RARE_ _RARE_ against the _RARE_ or _RARE_ as an independent , _RARE_ power in between Russia and Germany . STO
* _RARE_ says that invariably thereafter the _RARE_ used the same security argument to justify their course in Poland . STO
* This reasoning was also as inevitable as anything could be . STO
* Any free elections that were to be held in Poland would have to produce a government in which _RARE_ had complete confidence , and all pressure from the West for free voting by _RARE_ elements in Poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements . STO
* 6 . STO
* _RARE_ Europe In even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of Eastern Europe , where the upper classes had generally _RARE_ with the Nazis , even to the extent of sending millions of their _RARE_ into Russia as a part of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But at Yalta the conflicting expectations of East and West were _RARE_ into an agreement by the Big Three to assist all _RARE_ countries in Europe `` to create democratic institutions of their own choice '' . STO
* In any case `` here in their judgment conditions require '' ( _RARE_ added ) they would `` form _RARE_ governmental authorities _RARE_ representative of all democratic elements in the population and _RARE_ to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments _RARE_ to the will of the people '' . STO
* Other similar _RARE_ in the _RARE_ on _RARE_ Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the Western model . STO
* Later it developed that the _RARE_ had a very different interpretation of democracy , which will be discussed later , and their judgment never told them that the Big Three should _RARE_ in establishing democratic conditions , as we understand them , within their _RARE_ of influence . STO
* Professor _RARE_ thinks that at Yalta , Stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him , that he thought the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ from East European elections would not be greatly _RARE_ by his _RARE_ , while neither Roosevelt nor Churchill _RARE_ faced `` the fact that , in Poland at least , _RARE_ free democratic elections would return governments _RARE_ to Russia '' , by any definition of international _RARE_ . STO
* Also _RARE_ _RARE_ and cooperation had `` obscured the differences between Russian and Western ideas of democracy '' , and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal _RARE_ than to _RARE_ the military _RARE_ over Germany and Japan . STO
* The application of these _RARE_ could not please both sides , for they really attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable . STO
* While obliged to _RARE_ governments in East Europe allied with the Soviet Union instead of opposed to it , we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in East Europe . STO
* This illusion was described in a _RARE_ editorial in The New York Herald Tribune , on March 5 , 1947 , in connection with the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ peace _RARE_ to the Senate . STO
* In doing so Marshall and _RARE_ were `` asking for the _RARE_ of a grim lesson in the facts of international life '' . STO
* We had _RARE_ exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world . STO
* `` We were troubled about the fate of the _RARE_ States . STO
* Yalta left us with comforting _RARE_ of a Western _RARE_ political economy _RARE_ supreme up to the _RARE_ line and the _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' ( _RARE_ added ) . STO
* This is a penetrating description of our post-war illusion , which applied to other areas than East Europe . STO
* The same editorial continued that `` We expected to _RARE_ Japan and _RARE_ and to see a new China pattern itself easily on our institutions . STO
* We expected , in short , that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple , from such a position , to deal with the _RARE_ aberrations of the Soviet Union '' . STO
* Yet actually `` the image _RARE_ in no way to the _RARE_ of the post-war world . STO
* Neither our military , our economic nor our _RARE_ power reached far enough '' to determine the fate of East Europe . STO
* Then the editorial added _RARE_ : `` how far they may reach in Asia is yet _RARE_ , but they fall far short of our dreams of the war conferences '' . STO
* Here is the best short explanation of the _RARE_ of the Cold War that has been written . STO
* _RARE_ to _RARE_ the lesson so clearly contained in the _RARE_ _RARE_ , President _RARE_ _RARE_ the Cold War on March 12 , 1947 , in the _RARE_ Doctrine , exactly one week after the Herald Tribune editorial was written , and a year after the Cold War had been announced by Churchill at _RARE_ , Missouri , in _RARE_ presence . STO
* Then China promptly went Communist , and Mr. _RARE_ had to fight the _RARE_ _RARE_ war for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ before we learned how far our _RARE_ did `` reach in Asia '' . STO
* _RARE_ of war , strain , and hatred ; ; of heavy arms expenditures and constant danger of another world war had to _RARE_ before the United States could bring itself to accept the two chief results of World War 2 , -- Communist control of East Europe and China -- a new balance of power . STO
* While the Cold War raged it was easy to blame it all on Yalta . STO
* Yet , in _RARE_ a series of careful _RARE_ on the Yalta Conference , _RARE_ _RARE_ could find no basis for Yalta becoming `` a symbol for _RARE_ and a _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of Roosevelt and international cooperation '' . STO
* When the Yalta _RARE_ were finally published with great _RARE_ they had revealed no _RARE_ by anyone . STO
* An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . STO
* First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . STO
* Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural _RARE_ . STO
* All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent _RARE_ of a popular judgment led to some _RARE_ . STO
* The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , _RARE_ and voting . STO
* _RARE_ technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above _RARE_ . STO
* However , the _RARE_ _RARE_ results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing _RARE_ under even the most favorable circumstances . STO
* A third aspect , and probably the one open to most controversy , is the results of the election . STO
* The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party _RARE_ , but all _RARE_ interested parties , including the government itself , were _RARE_ engaged in determining the party _RARE_ of all successful candidates the month following the elections . STO
* The fourth and _RARE_ point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . STO
* _RARE_ have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence . STO
* They were stressed in the speeches of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ when the first Council of _RARE_ was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council . STO
* King _RARE_ 5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local _RARE_ and made the first firm promise of elections on May Day , 1957 . STO
* There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the _RARE_ of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the _RARE_ of the Interior took the most _RARE_ view and that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic . STO
* Since the complicated process of establishing new _RARE_ and _RARE_ the _RARE_ plan left by the French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious . STO
* From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in _RARE_ politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government . STO
* Until the _RARE_ of _RARE_ was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to _RARE_ or to organize for political purposes . STO
* The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ de _RARE_ ) , the most important minor party at the time , _RARE_ to the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the civil service and influence in Radio _RARE_ . STO
* There were _RARE_ that the Ministry of the Interior favored an arbitrary , `` _RARE_ '' process , which were indirectly _RARE_ when the King personally _RARE_ in the planned meetings . STO
* The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement _RARE_ the citizens that `` the possibility of _RARE_ _RARE_ concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the _RARE_ itself '' would be supported by the King himself . STO
* The _RARE_ crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French _RARE_ were called in and notices of further investigation appeared from time to time . STO
* In January , 1958 , the _RARE_ of the Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the _RARE_ of election dates appeared once again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . STO
* Although the government was probably prepared for elections by _RARE_ , the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* In late 1957 the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal _RARE_ of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council of Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party . STO
* The parties were on the whole _RARE_ for elections , while the people were still _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and suffering the _RARE_ of poor _RARE_ in 1957 . STO
* Despite the internal and international crises that _RARE_ _RARE_ the elections remained a central issue . STO
* They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was _RARE_ determined to keep in office until elections could be held . STO
* But the eagerly sought `` _RARE_ '' of the Balafrej Council of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal _RARE_ over foreign policy , labor politics and economic development . STO
* By December , 1958 , when ' _RARE_ _RARE_ became President of the Council , elections had even greater importance . STO
* They were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural _RARE_ as the focus of a new , constructive national effort . STO
* To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej _RARE_ the _RARE_ government was formed . STO
* A _RARE_ personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry of the Interior to plan and to conduct the elections . STO
* By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete . STO
* There remained only the delicate task of _RARE_ the laws through the _RARE_ of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions . STO
* From the rather _RARE_ history of electoral planning in _RARE_ an important point _RARE_ concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results . STO
* In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of _RARE_ fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . STO
* In the absence of a reservoir of political _RARE_ each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new _RARE_ , but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent . STO
* _RARE_ the respected and effective institutions that _RARE_ helps provide , minority parties , such as the _RARE_ in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal _RARE_ in 1958 , _RARE_ for elections when out of power , but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power . STO
* Those in power tend to _RARE_ and even to _RARE_ the electoral process . STO
* The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of _RARE_ rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in _RARE_ . STO
* At the central level the _RARE_ _RARE_ voting system was selected over some form of the _RARE_ de _RARE_ system , even though the latter had been recommended by _RARE_ and favored by all political parties . STO
* The choice of the single member district was _RARE_ to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections . STO
* Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly _RARE_ their candidates . STO
* With multiple member districts the still _RARE_ local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly . STO
* Both parties and the Ministry of the Interior were _RARE_ at work after the elections trying to _RARE_ the political _RARE_ of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a _RARE_ but known degree of national political significance . STO
* Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to _RARE_ party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation . STO
* The general setting of the _RARE_ election may also encourage the _RARE_ of local party organization . STO
* The concentration of effective power in _RARE_ leads not only to party _RARE_ , but to _RARE_ from local activity that might have had many _RARE_ benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections . STO
* _RARE_ evidence can be found in the results of the _RARE_ of Commerce elections , which took place three weeks before national elections . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ et _RARE_ ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( _RARE_ National _RARE_ Forces _RARE_ ) in nearly all urban centers . STO
* As the more conservative group with strong backing from _RARE_ businessmen , the _RARE_ was generally favored against the more progressive , _RARE_ U.N.F.P. . STO
* The newer party _RARE_ heavily , while the older , more _RARE_ party expected the _RARE_ _RARE_ and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years . STO
* The local Istiqlal and _RARE_ offices did not campaign and lost heavily . STO
* The value of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table 1 . STO
* The _RARE_ of Commerce elections were , of course , an important event in the preparation for rural _RARE_ elections . STO
* The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on _RARE_ support , was most effective . STO
* The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily _RARE_ to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics . STO
* The overall effect was probably to _RARE_ more party activity in the _RARE_ elections than might have otherwise taken place . STO
* A second major point of this _RARE_ is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections . STO
* Although a somewhat technical subject , it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated . STO
* Furthermore , the problems and solutions _RARE_ in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of the elections was naturally an _RARE_ and _RARE_ procedure . STO
* As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed _RARE_ that a government dominated by either party could fairly _RARE_ elections . STO
* The _RARE_ and later the _RARE_ _RARE_ protected the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ government . STO
* The bulk of the preparation had , of course , proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior , whose officials are _RARE_ from party activity and probably generally _RARE_ in party politics . STO
* _RARE_ from some areas of _RARE_ trouble , like _RARE_ _RARE_ , where _RARE_ officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials _RARE_ in the electoral process . STO
* _RARE_ , however , the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer _RARE_ of office was very likely an unfair advantage . STO
* The King decided to remove _RARE_ a week before elections and to _RARE_ a _RARE_ Council of Government under his personal direction . STO
* Although the _RARE_ had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance , his action was an _RARE_ admission that party _RARE_ were a factor . STO
* The new Council was itself _RARE_ of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P. members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders . STO
* Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal _RARE_ with the U.N.F.P. . STO
* _RARE_ preparations began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual _RARE_ and planning for the rural _RARE_ was completed in 1958 . STO
* There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of _RARE_ and the registration of candidates . STO
* _RARE_ registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 . STO
* The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ in each _RARE_ made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials . STO
* A goal was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused on its fulfillment . STO
* The qualifications to vote were kept very simple . STO
* Both men and women of _RARE_ years of age could register and vote upon _RARE_ proof of residence and identification . STO
* There were liberal provisions for _RARE_ where documents or records were lacking . STO
* The police were _RARE_ along with certain categories of _RARE_ citizens , _RARE_ and those punished for _RARE_ activities . STO
* The registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for _RARE_ _RARE_ were made without the benefit of a reliable census . STO
* _RARE_ older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure _RARE_ and _RARE_ in an occupation with a future . STO
* Some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . STO
* _RARE_ programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in _RARE_ with the passage of the _RARE_ Act , which provided a continuing annual _RARE_ of _RARE_ million to support , on a matching basis , _RARE_ programs of vocational education in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , industrial skills and home economics . STO
* Since _RARE_ some _RARE_ supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . STO
* The _RARE_ Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to _RARE_ million in addition to the _RARE_ million under the Smith Act . STO
* The Health Amendment Act of 1956 added _RARE_ million for practical nurse training . STO
* The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the _RARE_ Act . STO
* _RARE_ authorizations of _RARE_ million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled _RARE_ . STO
* The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools . STO
* The initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts . STO
* Even the states remain primarily in an _RARE_ role , providing leadership and teacher training . STO
* Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at least half . STO
* The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . STO
* Throughout the history of the program , state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or _RARE_ the Federal expenditures , while local districts all together have spent more than either Federal or state governments . STO
* Today , Federal funds account for only _RARE_ of the _RARE_ expenditures for vocational education . STO
* The greatest impact of the _RARE_ principle has been in initially encouraging the _RARE_ states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . STO
* National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades . STO
* During World War 2 , about _RARE_ million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) _RARE_ Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War _RARE_ Training . STO
* The total cost of the _RARE_ program was _RARE_ million . STO
* For the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and National Defense Act of 1958 , the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years was only about _RARE_ million . STO
* No comparable measures are available of _RARE_ and expenditures for private vocational education training . STO
* There are a great number and variety of private commercial schools , trade schools and technical schools . STO
* In addition , many large corporations operate their own formal training programs . STO
* A recent study indicated that 85 per cent of the _RARE_ largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and _RARE_ . STO
* Most skilled industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions . STO
* The National _RARE_ Council of Columbia University has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five _RARE_ have not been formally trained . STO
* There is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education . STO
* _RARE_ prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those without , and most _RARE_ of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers , but it provides the essential _RARE_ for developing skills . STO
* In most states , trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools , usually located in the larger cities . STO
* In _RARE_ fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses . STO
* In Illinois about 13 per cent of the schools have programs , and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent . STO
* An important recent trend is the development of area vocational schools . STO
* For a number of years Kentucky , _RARE_ and several other states have been building _RARE_ vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties . STO
* These schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts . STO
* _RARE_ may be provided from nearby school districts . STO
* _RARE_ are provided mainly for post high school day programs ; ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted . STO
* The Title 8 , program of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools . STO
* By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states . STO
* They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas . STO
* An extension of this program into the other _RARE_ areas should be undertaken . STO
* _RARE_ to new industry Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry . STO
* The major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of _RARE_ training for a large number of _RARE_ machine operators . STO
* A few key skilled workers experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere . STO
* A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees . STO
* The existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled . STO
* Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being . STO
* Thus , besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an _RARE_ to industrial development efforts . STO
* Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of _RARE_ new industry . STO
* The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad _RARE_ flexible basis to _RARE_ any local _RARE_ training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . STO
* Local focus of programs The major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands . STO
* This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country . STO
* Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers . STO
* All the _RARE_ for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of _RARE_ the growth of local jobs , and of _RARE_ with local _RARE_ on the types of courses and their content . STO
* Furthermore , there is a _RARE_ _RARE_ on the part of those making local skill surveys . STO
* Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical . STO
* While the U. S. Department of Labor has a program of _RARE_ industry and _RARE_ employment _RARE_ and _RARE_ current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used _RARE_ in local curriculum planning . STO
* The U. S. Office of Education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys . STO
* This procedure is extremely _RARE_ in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment . STO
* _RARE_ studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job _RARE_ and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills . STO
* No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand _RARE_ in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained . STO
* Moreover , the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and _RARE_ . STO
* There simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable . STO
* Much of the available information comes not from the Federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states . STO
* _RARE_ State and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to _RARE_ a wider outlook on future job opportunities . STO
* There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs . STO
* A related question is whether _RARE_ workers can be _RARE_ to take the training provided . STO
* There is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to _RARE_ in their programs , even though they must pay _RARE_ , receive no _RARE_ payments , and are not _RARE_ a job . STO
* However , there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training . STO
* Again , one major difficulty is the local focus . STO
* A training program in a depressed area may have few _RARE_ unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community . STO
* If there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many more workers can be expected to respond . STO
* Another problem is who will pay for the training . STO
* Local school districts are hard pressed _RARE_ and _RARE_ about vocational training . STO
* _RARE_ usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it . STO
* Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and _RARE_ it . STO
* State governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities . STO
* Only the Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and _RARE_ view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . STO
* If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit _RARE_ in other states . STO
* However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . STO
* Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other _RARE_ . STO
* A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G. I. bills and also by some recent _RARE_ in attitudes toward _RARE_ college education : that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . STO
* This probably would require some support for _RARE_ as well as for _RARE_ , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a _RARE_ _RARE_ Corps . STO
* A maximum of $600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home . STO
* A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . STO
* Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training . STO
* Such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located . STO
* This would _RARE_ possibilities for _RARE_ cooperative , _RARE_ and extension training . STO
* _RARE_ financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual . STO
* His _RARE_ and _RARE_ could be given more weight in selecting the proper training . STO
* But briefly , the _RARE_ _RARE_ must be examined for its _RARE_ . STO
* Then the fact that the lower channel line was _RARE_ had further forecasting significance . STO
* And then the application of the count rules to the width ( _RARE_ ) of the _RARE_ gives us an _RARE_ estimate of the probable depth of the decline . STO
* The very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of _RARE_ activity and the extent of the _RARE_ ( run up or run down ) movement . STO
* This expectation is what really `` sold '' point and figure . STO
* But there is no positive and consistently _RARE_ relationship in the _RARE_ sense . STO
* _RARE_ will show that only the _RARE_ _RARE_ apply , and in fine , these merely _RARE_ upon a relationship between the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of events . STO
* After all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long . STO
* The advantages and disadvantages of these two types of _RARE_ , bar _RARE_ and point and figure _RARE_ , remain the subject of fairly _RARE_ litigation among their respective professional _RARE_ , with both methods enjoying in common , one _RARE_ merit . STO
* They are both _RARE_ methods . STO
* Even if we strip their respective claims to the _RARE_ minimum , the `` odds '' still favor them both , for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse . STO
* Of course , many more things are _RARE_ besides prices . STO
* The foregoing have been methods of _RARE_ prices , but now let us look at some of the other indices that are _RARE_ _RARE_ , and which are looked to for their forecasting _RARE_ . STO
* The quest for methods The search for forecasting _RARE_ is _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ have been worked up between the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price . STO
* The theory behind this is , of course , _RARE_ in character . STO
* As the number of reported freight car loadings increased , this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity , and consequently increased stock earnings , _RARE_ _RARE_ dividends , and _RARE_ therefore increased stock market prices . STO
* We now know that things rarely ever work out in such _RARE_ fashion , and that car loadings , while perhaps interesting enough , are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn . STO
* But the quest for such an index goes on _RARE_ , with all manner of _RARE_ and _RARE_ participating , ranging from the _RARE_ _RARE_ type virtually to the _RARE_ _RARE_ operator , all seeking _RARE_ , _RARE_ , daily -- and often _RARE_ -- for the enchanting index that will _RARE_ the eternal secret : Which way will the market move -- up or down ?

* It _RARE_ to mind the quest of _RARE_ times for the fountain of youth , a quest heavily invested in , during the days of wooden ships . STO
* Just as heavily invested are the _RARE_ of _RARE_ of modern men who carry on the quest for the enchanting index . STO
* The quest offers careers . STO
* Much of this goes on in offices high up in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* There sit men who make moving averages of weekly volume , monthly averages of _RARE_ ratios , ratios of the number of advances to the number of _RARE_ , ratios of an individual _RARE_ performance to overall market performance , ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume , odd-lot indices , and what not . STO
* They are concerned with all things _RARE_ in , securities , bonds , _RARE_ , coffee , _RARE_ , cotton , tin , _RARE_ , etc. . STO
* And along _RARE_ West Jackson Boulevard , La _RARE_ Street , and around the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ there sit men who chart _RARE_ reports , who divide the number of reported _RARE_ by the number of reported _RARE_ , and the number of _RARE_ by the amount of corn . STO
* They plot the open interest curves , _RARE_ curves , and they even divide Democratic _RARE_ by Republican _RARE_ . STO
* All these things and countless more enter into their calculations , and yet , the enchanting index remains _RARE_ . STO
* Not , at any rate , in the _RARE_ sense of the word . STO
* The markets are far too subtle , and the last word in these _RARE_ will doubtless never be written , for the enchanting index is about as _RARE_ as the fountain of youth . STO
* But whereas _RARE_ men no longer pursue the fountain , they never abandoned their pursuit of the enchanting index . STO
* We mentioned odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago . STO
* In the stock market , the normal trading package is a hundred shares , just as _RARE_ _RARE_ is the standard grain contract package . STO
* A stock _RARE_ for less than a hundred shares is executed via a special odd-lot _RARE_ on the floor of the exchange . STO
* This results in a separate record being made , _RARE_ these _RARE_ from the overall volume of trading . STO
* According to the theory underlying odd-lot indices , the _RARE_ who _RARE_ odd lots is most likely a small _RARE_ , one who can't afford to trade round lots . STO
* Or , to use the _RARE_ _RARE_ of one odd-lot index _RARE_ , they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated _RARE_ of traders . STO
* _RARE_ most easily prey to an adverse market movement , for this rank of traders can least afford to lose , virtually anything the odd-lot traders do , _RARE_ , is taken to _RARE_ the `` wrong '' thing to do . STO
* Figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers . STO
* _RARE_ index observers then make _RARE_ of the data according to their particular statistical _RARE_ . STO
* They might , for example , plot it exactly as is , or they might make ten day moving averages of it , or longer moving averages , or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales . STO
* The particular _RARE_ is a matter of individual taste . STO
* The data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart , usually of a popular stock average . STO
* _RARE_ the end of an intermediate or major rise , while the top is forming on the price chart , it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply . STO
* This _RARE_ the _RARE_ that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top . STO
* Similarly , at the opposite end of the market cycle , towards the end of an intermediate or major decline , usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart , it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again _RARE_ the _RARE_ that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood . STO
* Thus , in the aggregate , the odd-lot _RARE_ is one who _RARE_ at the tops and _RARE_ at the bottoms , _RARE_ occasional individual exceptions . STO
* While it had long been known in general , that `` the public is always wrong '' , the use of odd-lot indices now puts the _RARE_ on a statistical basis . STO
* One might well wonder why the `` public is always wrong '' and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg . STO
* Which came first ? STO
* Is it really that the `` public '' _RARE_ at the tops , and not that the market tops out when the `` public '' _RARE_ ? STO
* And the _RARE_ at bottoms . STO
* Does the `` public '' usually sell at bottoms , or does the market usually bottom out when the `` public '' _RARE_ ? STO
* We have been using the word `` public '' in _RARE_ marks , that is , in its _RARE_ _RARE_ with reference to the odd-lot index theory . STO
* Obviously someone has to sell in order for someone to buy , and vice _RARE_ . STO
* And while all concerned are members of the literal public , somewhat less than all concerned , although still a majority , form the _RARE_ marked `` public '' . STO
* And the public minus the `` public '' leaves the so-called `` sophisticated '' element -- the element on the other end of the `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ . STO
* This element is often called `` strong hands '' . STO
* Strong hands differ from `` weak hands '' in that their operations are the primary _RARE_ . STO
* They _RARE_ _RARE_ , so to speak , even if this _RARE_ is _RARE_ among them , and their _RARE_ action only _RARE_ organized . STO
* Strong hands act ; ; weak hands react . STO
* Strong hands move first ; ; weak hands ask , What is going on ? STO
* When strong hands buy , they are able to buy more , and they do it even in the face of _RARE_ news reports . STO
* They are able to sit more patiently with what they have bought . STO
* Needless to say , strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands , for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands _RARE_ on the way up , at higher prices , during the _RARE_ phase of the campaign . STO
* Certain badly _RARE_ market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow unfair , dirty , or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive forces . STO
* But after all , can anyone imagine a market _RARE_ the reverse of these things were true ? STO
* Try to imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose , and the majority would make consistent profits . STO
* How much and how many profits could a majority take out of the losses of a few ? STO
* Moreover , the _RARE_ concerning the `` sophisticated '' _RARE_ and its _RARE_ _RARE_ is put to test during every campaign , and _RARE_ only upon results ; ; not before . STO
* It quite often happens that _RARE_ go _RARE_ , resulting in a most _RARE_ _RARE_ of strong hands into _RARE_ hands , just as a member of a former _RARE_ `` public '' may emerge _RARE_ `` right '' the next time . STO
* _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ too . STO
* The study of odd-lot indices is somehow _RARE_ to the spectacle of a man trying to _RARE_ his own shadow , what with all observers trying to get on the side of the `` few '' at the same time . STO
* The usefulness of this study and of _RARE_ analysis as well , _RARE_ in direct proportion to the _RARE_ of its use . STO
* It has to , by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word `` few '' . STO
* _RARE_ opposition must _RARE_ as to the future course of prices , if there is to _RARE_ a market at all . STO
* And the few must win what the many lose , for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all , and is , in fact , _RARE_ . STO
* There need be no _RARE_ about _RARE_ this . STO
* _RARE_ still _RARE_ that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market _RARE_ the majority consistently _RARE_ what the minority _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. John _RARE_ , whose work has been discussed in this chapter , was quoted in a New _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ as saying : `` Of course , you have to remember it's a good thing for us _RARE_ that there aren't more of us . STO
* If you got too many people _RARE_ by this method , their operations would begin to affect stock prices , and thus throw the _RARE_ off . STO
* The method would become _RARE_ '' . STO
* Mr. Alexander H. _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ In Point And Figure _RARE_ tells the readers : `` We assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the securities and commodities markets '' . STO
* What with traders trading for so many different objectives , and what with there being so many unique and _RARE_ market theories and trading techniques in use , and more coming into use all the time , it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough `` fans '' to _RARE_ itself . STO
* Nevertheless , all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible _RARE_ of expression , if they lead to a market _RARE_ at all . STO
* In the final analysis , then , the _RARE_ becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance , _RARE_ any amount of _RARE_ and calculation , however elaborate . STO
* Thus while his theory or technique may not be _RARE_ , it is commonplace for _RARE_ and _RARE_ positions to become temporarily _RARE_ . STO
* Though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse , the possible conclusions remain but two . STO
* Chapter 6 , more methods the _RARE_ The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already in use , so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that is to follow , and to _RARE_ the forecast that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead . STO
* In assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . STO
* By and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . STO
* Moreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a _RARE_ influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . STO
* _RARE_ has been a _RARE_ year for _RARE_ of general business activity . STO
* During much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a _RARE_ _RARE_ , but there have been persistent signs of _RARE_ in the economy . STO
* The tendency for general business activity to _RARE_ somewhat is becoming more evident . STO
* Although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the _RARE_ process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer . STO
* It is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust . STO
* The rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be _RARE_ out and facing some decline . STO
* In earlier business _RARE_ , when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp _RARE_ in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to obtain . STO
* At this time , however , there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to _RARE_ a sharp rise in residential construction . STO
* These signs are the inventories of _RARE_ houses in some areas of the country and the moderate rise in _RARE_ rates for apartments ( _RARE_ in September ) . STO
* On the other hand , in a more favorable vein , general business activity should receive some stimulus from rising Federal spending , and the reduction in business inventories has probably run a good part of its course . STO
* The 2% increase in retail sales in October to a _RARE_ high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the National Industrial Conference Board , which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans . STO
* The pattern of general business activity which probably lies ahead of us is a further moderate _RARE_ through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity gets under way . STO
* The recovery will probably be _RARE_ by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit , as well as by an expansion of Government spending , well sustained consumer spending , and some _RARE_ of business inventories . STO
* _RARE_ downward pressure What does the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rates in 1961 ? STO
* It suggests that during the next several months , through the spring of 1961 , the demand for long-term capital funds may be _RARE_ lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower , especially the rates on Federal , state , and local bonds , as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds . STO
* However , as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present , as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by _RARE_ , the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high , so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great . STO
* It seems likely , moreover , that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage _RARE_ institutions , interest rates on residential _RARE_ may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year , although the increased ease in residential mortgage _RARE_ may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate , e.g. , easier _RARE_ and _RARE_ terms . STO
* If the trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here , we are likely to see additional steps by the Federal Reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit . STO
* Certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility , as well as an easier reserve position for the _RARE_ system . STO
* However , the monetary authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the _RARE_ of gold , as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive _RARE_ in the economy , which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle . STO
* _RARE_ market policy One of the most _RARE_ questions is whether the recent _RARE_ of the Federal Reserve authorities from _RARE_ their open market operations to Treasury bills will spread into _RARE_ Government securities in the next few months . STO
* To the extent that the new Administration has its wishes , the Federal Reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of Government securities and _RARE_ seek to force down long-term interest rates . STO
* The principle of `` bills only '' , or `` bills preferably '' , seems so strongly accepted by the Federal Reserve that it is difficult to _RARE_ conditions which would persuade the authorities to _RARE_ _RARE_ from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term Government securities . STO
* However , to the extent that the monetary authorities , in their effort to ease credit in the next several months , conduct their open market operations in _RARE_ Government bonds , they will certainly act to _RARE_ any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces . STO
* By the end of the spring of 1961 , assuming that a general business recovery gets under way , interest rates should begin to edge upward again , depending upon the _RARE_ of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to _RARE_ credit availability . STO
* My guess would be that interest rates will decline _RARE_ into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the _RARE_ . STO
* It is pertinent to ask the question : _RARE_ the long _RARE_ of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course , and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and Federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest rates ? STO
* My answer is in the negative because I believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies , and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels . STO
* Five basic forces This view is based upon several basic economic forces which I believe will be operating in the Sixties , as follows : ( 1 ) Recent events in the General _RARE_ of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us , and probably _RARE_ , for the _RARE_ future . STO
* This makes it certain that Federal expenditures for military _RARE_ and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years . STO
* We are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new African nations against the _RARE_ competition of the Communist _RARE_ . STO
* Our efforts to overcome the lead of the _RARE_ in space are bound to mean accelerated Federal spending . STO
* Moreover , it is likely that Federal policies aimed at _RARE_ a faster rate of economic growth of the country , to keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs , will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas such as education , housing , medical aid , and the like . STO
* There are serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising Federal expenditures , of which I take a dim view , but it seems very likely to occur . STO
* ( 2 ) During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant _RARE_ up in the rate of household _RARE_ , which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building . STO
* According to the latest projections of the Bureau of the _RARE_ , the annual rate of household _RARE_ will increase for the next 20 years . STO
* Under the most favorable assumptions for increase , the Bureau of the _RARE_ projects that the annual rate of household _RARE_ will rise from about _RARE_ in the last two years of the Fifties to an annual rate of about _RARE_ in the first five years of the Sixties , and to a slightly higher annual rate of _RARE_ in the second half of the decade . STO
* During the _RARE_ the projections show a more pronounced rise to an annual rate of _RARE_ in the second half of that decade . STO
* Accordingly , the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing _RARE_ by the higher rate of household formation should _RARE_ the general economic prospects of the Sixties . STO
* However , the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated . STO
* The average annual rate of _RARE_ in the second half of the Sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ period from April 1947 to March 1950 . STO
* ( 3 ) With the expansion of family formation in the Sixties , a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated . STO
* This is an area in which there is still a large backlog of demand . STO
* State and local expenditures ( in real terms ) increased _RARE_ from _RARE_ in 1949 to _RARE_ in 1959 , and it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade , which would carry them to the neighborhood of _RARE_ by _RARE_ . STO
* Here would be a powerful force for raising business activity . STO
* ( 4 ) It seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play , the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the Fifties . STO
* _RARE_ by keen competition in our industrial system , and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research , plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade . STO
* ( 5 ) In a more _RARE_ vein about the economic outlook , I suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing which was _RARE_ during the _RARE_ and World War 2 , is finally in the process of running dry . STO
* There is some clear-cut evidence of this . STO
* For example , the huge postwar demand on the part of _RARE_ for housing under the _RARE_ home loan _RARE_ program seems to have largely exhausted itself . STO
* Indeed , the failure of _RARE_ as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing , and the increasing reports of pockets of _RARE_ homes and rising _RARE_ rates in apartment buildings , may also signal in part that the _RARE_ days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an end . STO
* In a way , we may be _RARE_ the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on _RARE_ cars free of the _RARE_ which were accepted in the Fifties . STO
* The huge backlog of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the War was fed by liquid assets _RARE_ by the public during the War , and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields . STO
* The _RARE_ public has used up a good part of these liquid assets , or they have been drained by the rising price level , and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier . STO
* This is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the Sixties . STO
* I am _RARE_ that it will , but consumer spending in the Sixties will not be _RARE_ by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized most of the Fifties . STO
* _RARE_ should become more competitive as _RARE_ become more selective . STO
* _RARE_ capital requirements Accordingly , during the Sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the Fifties and , in the process , to require enormous amounts of capital funds . STO
* _RARE_ policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . STO
* The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the _RARE_ behavior of a few very important industries . STO
* While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2 . STO
* Indeed , the apparent _RARE_ of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented . STO
* The model of this paper _RARE_ an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its _RARE_ policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny . STO
* Where the industry's product price has been kept below the `` _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . STO
* The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . STO
* In order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public-limit _RARE_ '' on `` key '' wage _RARE_ , we deliberately simplify the model by _RARE_ from other forces , such as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . STO
* For _RARE_ purposes , this is best treated as a model which _RARE_ out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages . STO
* Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by _RARE_ out its assumptions . STO
* Part 2 , _RARE_ the operation of the model and _RARE_ some significant conclusions . STO
* Part 3 , _RARE_ the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions . STO
* Part 4 , is a brief summary . STO
* The _RARE_ Appendix presents the _RARE_ argument , but is best read after Part 1 , in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit . STO
* 1 , the assumptions of the model A . STO
* The industry The industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross national product . STO
* _RARE_ competition is lacking . STO
* For the purposes of setting the product price , the industry _RARE_ as a single _RARE_ . STO
* In wage _RARE_ , the industry _RARE_ as a unit with a single union . STO
* B . STO
* The demand for the industry's product We are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry's product . STO
* The manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given . STO
* In any given time period , the aggregate demand for the industry's product is determined by two things : the price charged by the industry , and the level of Aj . STO
* For the purposes of this discussion , the problem of relative prices is _RARE_ in these two variables , since GNP includes other prices . STO
* ( We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change proportionately . STO
* ) The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of Aj . STO
* C . STO
* Industry product price policy The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest . STO
* Because of its importance , and because the lack of price competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases . STO
* The threat of effective _RARE_ action , _RARE_ by `` _RARE_ the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of _RARE_ relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases . STO
* For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the _RARE_ _RARE_ price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the _RARE_ price ( but not below average cost ) . STO
* For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is _RARE_ `` justified '' by rising costs ( due to rising wages , etc. ) . STO
* Thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate . STO
* In this model , we abstract from all _RARE_ sources of cost changes , so that the `` public-limit price '' only rises as the wage rate rises . STO
* In such circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate . STO
* Since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises , the _RARE_ price also rises when the public-limit price is _RARE_ , and is likely to remain well above the latter . STO
* The _RARE_ price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general _RARE_ permits profit _RARE_ to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public-limit price to approach the _RARE_ price . STO
* The _RARE_ price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic _RARE_ do not enter foreign costs directly . STO
* Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its _RARE_ in `` _RARE_ '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , _RARE_ _RARE_ relief after it has `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ to the union pressure . STO
* Whether or not it is in the industry's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase . STO
* The extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase . STO
* We are _RARE_ from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry . STO
* The industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in order to `` _RARE_ '' the government and the customers of the industry . STO
* As a strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement . STO
* They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would _RARE_ . STO
* Public indignation and resistance to _RARE_ increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of _RARE_ per _RARE_ than when the increases are on the order of _RARE_ per month . STO
* The simple passage of an additional eleven _RARE_ time makes the second _RARE_ _RARE_ more _RARE_ . STO
* Thus , the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase . STO
* _RARE_ , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per _RARE_ , without an accompanying wage increase . STO
* Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase . STO
* This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however -- only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against _RARE_ increases . STO
* Finally , since the public requires some _RARE_ on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call for less than proportionately larger price increases ( e.g. , if a wage increase of _RARE_ allows a price increase of _RARE_ , a wage increase of _RARE_ allows a price increase of something less than _RARE_ ) . STO
* D . STO
* Industry costs We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced ( the average cost curve is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry ) . STO
* The level of this average cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and so forth . STO
* As we have noted , however , we are _RARE_ from changes in all _RARE_ of this level except for changes in the wage rate . STO
* The level of average cost ( equal to marginal cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate . STO
* E . STO
* Union policies and collective bargaining issues The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate . STO
* The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy -- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment . STO
* The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset _RARE_ increases , but we abstract from these forces here . STO
* For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or _RARE_ adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs . STO
* _RARE_ is something of an _RARE_ concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry , much less to the union or to the public . STO
* _RARE_ on the amount of productivity increase _RARE_ the problem of _RARE_ how an increase in profit _RARE_ related to a productivity increase should be shared . STO
* The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not _RARE_ the assumption that the union is willing to settle for _RARE_ and _RARE_ increases as distinct from a _RARE_ increase in the basic wage rate . STO
* We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that _RARE_ increases may offset _RARE_ increases , and it does not entirely _RARE_ the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate . STO
* For internal political reasons , the union asks for ( and _RARE_ ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously _RARE_ a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate _RARE_ is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry . STO
* _RARE_ in the basic wage rate are _RARE_ , and they constitute an argument for raising prices . STO
* However , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude . STO
* In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be _RARE_ out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise . STO
* Thus , for _RARE_ changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active _RARE_ , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be _RARE_ in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages _RARE_ . STO
* From this _RARE_ it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model . STO
* It is this conclusion that we challenge ; ; we do so by _RARE_ the _RARE_ on which it is based . STO
* 2 , the operation of the model It is convenient to assume that the _RARE_ contract is of one year's duration . STO
* In the century from _RARE_ to _RARE_ the law of nations became international law . STO
* Several factors contributed to this change . STO
* The Congress of _RARE_ is a convenient starting point because it both _RARE_ and _RARE_ what was to follow . STO
* Here in _RARE_ the great nations assembled to _RARE_ not merely for Europe , but for the world . STO
* Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . STO
* International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations _RARE_ , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . STO
* _RARE_ this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and _RARE_ in their political _RARE_ with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . STO
* In both respects , international law was _RARE_ . STO
* It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . STO
* On the one hand , the major European nations had to maintain _RARE_ each other an emphasis upon _RARE_ , independence , formal _RARE_ -- thus _RARE_ for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of _RARE_ '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the _RARE_ _RARE_ experience . STO
* But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world . STO
* Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . STO
* _RARE_ interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America ( though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine , itself from the _RARE_ related to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European `` balance '' itself . STO
* A nation such as _RARE_ could be _RARE_ by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its _RARE_ ; ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the _RARE_ of the Latin American countries ; ; out of the question was the _RARE_ of Asia and Africa . STO
* This _RARE_ of the law was made explicit by a number of _RARE_ century scholars . STO
* More emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` _RARE_ nations '' ; ; Kent and _RARE_ , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made use of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent . STO
* _RARE_ stated that the public law was essentially `` limited to the _RARE_ and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin '' . STO
* Of course it had always been of European origin in fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory . STO
* Now , with virtually every writer , not only was the European origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced _RARE_ of Europe were to be imposed on others . STO
* The European customs on which international law was based were to become , by force and _RARE_ , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . STO
* Hall , for example , was quite explicit on this point when he said states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of _RARE_ countries . STO
* They must do something with the _RARE_ of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its _RARE_ beyond all possibility of _RARE_ '' . STO
* During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin American writers , though _RARE_ , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . STO
* A number of other _RARE_ developments contributed to the _RARE_ of the law of nations into international law ; ; that is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . STO
* The difference is important , for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among _RARE_ , this was by no means its exclusive _RARE_ . STO
* The law of nature _RARE_ _RARE_ in their relationship to their own citizens , to _RARE_ , and to each other in a _RARE_ unified system . STO
* The theory of international law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this _RARE_ . STO
* It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules _RARE_ the exercise of state power for reasons essentially _RARE_ with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . STO
* No longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do ; ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . STO
* To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of _RARE_ philosophy . STO
* First , and most obvious , was the growing _RARE_ and the tendency to regard the state , and the _RARE_ identification with the state , as _RARE_ other ties of social solidarity . STO
* National identification was not new , but it was _RARE_ in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new _RARE_ occurred . STO
* It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put forward by the Germans , especially by _RARE_ , although political _RARE_ will recognize its _RARE_ in the rejected _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* National identification was reflected _RARE_ in law theories which incorporated this _RARE_ _RARE_ and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection . STO
* In the international community this reduced law to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a _RARE_ of _RARE_ , or _RARE_ . STO
* According to the new theories , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical _RARE_ . STO
* He no longer sought to find the law ; ; he made it ; ; he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be . STO
* There was no law , domestic or international , except that _RARE_ by , acknowledged by , or _RARE_ to by states . STO
* _RARE_ behind _RARE_ _RARE_ were more practical reasons for a changing _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ to , but _RARE_ from , _RARE_ was the growth of democracy in one form or another . STO
* _RARE_ participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions . STO
* The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of _RARE_ , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be _RARE_ and enforced as law through _RARE_ institutions . STO
* Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms . STO
* _RARE_ was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were _RARE_ . STO
* The old way of doing things , which _RARE_ on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no longer adequate to the task . STO
* First was the period of _RARE_ of existing law : the Code _RARE_ in France and the peculiar _RARE_ that , in fact , resulted from _RARE_ _RARE_ and ordering of the Common Law in England . STO
* _RARE_ was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation , some changing and adjusting the older law , much dealing with entirely new situations . STO
* The legislative mills have been grinding ever since , and when its _RARE_ processes were no longer adequate to the task , a limited legislative authority was _RARE_ in one form or another , to the executive . STO
* Whereas the _RARE_ century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and _RARE_ have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law . STO
* Indeed , with developed _RARE_ , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific . STO
* In municipal systems we tend to view what is called _RARE_ as _RARE_ a movement to _RARE_ policy by increasing the power of _RARE_ -- the elected representatives -- at the expense of the more conservative _RARE_ . STO
* When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit -- when norms were _RARE_ and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in _RARE_ hands -- two purposes were served : Government was made _RARE_ to an _RARE_ popular will , and law became a rational system for _RARE_ that will , for serving conscious goals , for _RARE_ the `` public policy '' . STO
* It is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , _RARE_ the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; ; but even _RARE_ was a conscious policy . STO
* Law was seen as an _RARE_ of the `` sovereign will '' . STO
* However , the sovereign was not _RARE_ absolute _RARE_ but rather the _RARE_ sovereign of _RARE_ . STO
* It was , too , an _RARE_ philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by no means an _RARE_ or _RARE_ one . STO
* Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny . STO
* The theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It was merely a _RARE_ and ordering of new institutions of popular government . STO
* It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who _RARE_ public authority . STO
* _RARE_ was this true as _RARE_ capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . STO
* To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising _RARE_ , and this objective required that governmental authority -- administrative officials and judges -- be limited as precisely and _RARE_ as possible ; ; that old customs which _RARE_ trade be _RARE_ ; ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might _RARE_ the automatic adjustments of the free market ; ; that obligations of status that were _RARE_ with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . STO
* _RARE_ -- conceived as the free bargain of formal _RARE_ -- replaced the implied obligations of a more static and _RARE_ society . STO
* Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the _RARE_ of the free society . STO
* Government itself was based upon contract ; ; business organization -- the corporation -- was analyzed in contractual terms ; ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was _RARE_ and _RARE_ on contractual terms ; ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement . STO
* It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract . STO
* In fact , some -- _RARE_ is the principle example -- went so far as to say that all international law could be _RARE_ to the single legal _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The displacement ( at least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical _RARE_ of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ centuries by _RARE_ _RARE_ both international law theory and doctrine . STO
* In the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , _RARE_ the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system . STO
* One result was to _RARE_ much that had been regarded as the law of nations . STO
* _RARE_ law , the law merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law of Nations and made dependent on the several national laws . STO
* _RARE_ international law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international law proper , or , as it is often called , public international law . STO
* States were free to enact , within broad , though ( perhaps ) _RARE_ limits , their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law merchant , and to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high _RARE_ . STO
* The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be _RARE_ by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations . STO
* Mr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . STO
* In this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the _RARE_ of Article 1 . STO
* If this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . STO
* Federal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law . STO
* Then in _RARE_ , apparently in response to the _RARE_ influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- _RARE_ with state _RARE_ -- to decide cases involving _RARE_ questions . STO
* One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights _RARE_ by the Civil War _RARE_ against state interference . STO
* _RARE_ difficulty arose with the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* An _RARE_ , presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves , became a `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ upon state economic policy . STO
* A _RARE_ of federal lower court _RARE_ seriously _RARE_ the processes of local government . STO
* Congress reacted with a series of measures _RARE_ in various ways what it had granted in _RARE_ . STO
* In 1910 it required the _RARE_ of a special _RARE_ court for the _RARE_ of certain _RARE_ and allowed direct _RARE_ to the Supreme Court . STO
* Such legislation was _RARE_ and extended from time to time thereafter . STO
* In 1913 an _RARE_ provision was made for the stay of federal _RARE_ proceedings upon institution of state court test cases . STO
* The essential _RARE_ of these measures resulted in _RARE_ in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to _RARE_ state public utility rate orders . STO
* Three years later similar restraints were imposed upon _RARE_ against collection of state taxes . STO
* This saved for state _RARE_ , in the first instance , the two major areas where federal _RARE_ had been most _RARE_ , but other areas remained vulnerable . STO
* Meanwhile , the Supreme Court , like Congress , showed _RARE_ concerning this aspect of government by _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ upon the traditional discretion of the _RARE_ , Mr. Justice _RARE_ introduced a series of _RARE_ judicial restraints that _RARE_ in Mr. Justice _RARE_ famous doctrine of _RARE_ . STO
* Whereas the earlier cases turned rather _RARE_ upon the availability of adequate state _RARE_ , the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue . STO
* The classic case is _RARE_ Commission v. _RARE_ . STO
* The commission had issued an administrative order which was challenged as _RARE_ against Negroes . STO
* Its enforcement was _RARE_ by a federal trial court . STO
* On review the Supreme Court , via Mr. Justice Frankfurter , found southern racial problems `` a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to _RARE_ is open '' . STO
* An alternative was found in the _RARE_ of state law as to whether the _RARE_ order had in fact been authorized . STO
* _RARE_ , as usual , to interpret state legislation -- such interpretation can only be a `` forecast rather than a determination '' -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter led a _RARE_ Court to _RARE_ the _RARE_ . STO
* But it is crucial that here , unlike _RARE_ , the trial court was ordered to _RARE_ the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the _RARE_ question . STO
* `` The resources of _RARE_ are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , i.e. , _RARE_ , is one thing ; ; refusal to _RARE_ is another . STO
* To the extent that the _RARE_ principle of _RARE_ stands _RARE_ by subsequent legislation , federal equitable relief against state action must be available -- or so it seems to Mr. Justice Frankfurter . STO
* In Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern _RARE_ Co. , the commission had refused to permit _RARE_ of certain `` _RARE_ '' train facilities . STO
* The railroad , claiming _RARE_ of property without due process of law , sought _RARE_ relief . STO
* The Court held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be _RARE_ ; ; this in the name of equitable discretion . STO
* _RARE_ Frankfurter and Jackson _RARE_ in the Court's result , for they found no merit in the _RARE_ claim . STO
* But they _RARE_ vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction _RARE_ in a valid act of Congress : `` By one fell _RARE_ the Court now finds that Congress _RARE_ in _RARE_ legislation in the acts of 1910 , 1913 , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* By these measures , Congress , so the Court ( in effect ) now _RARE_ , gave not only _RARE_ but inadequate relief , since it now appears that the federal courts have inherent power to _RARE_ the Act of _RARE_ against all proceedings challenging local regulation '' . STO
* A most revealing recent case is _RARE_ _RARE_ Union v. Lincoln Mills . STO
* The _RARE_ Act gave the federal courts jurisdiction over `` suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry _RARE_ commerce '' . STO
* On its face this merely provides a federal _RARE_ ; ; it does not establish any law ( rights ) for the federal judges to enforce . STO
* How can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when Congress has created none ? STO
* The Court held that Congress had intended the federal _RARE_ to `` fashion '' an appropriate law of _RARE_ contracts . STO
* In short , _RARE_ power to grant _RARE_ authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that Congress need not create , or specify , the right to be enforced . STO
* The Lincoln Mills decision _RARE_ a whole new body of federal `` common law '' which , as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in _RARE_ , leads to one of the following `` _RARE_ '' : `` ( ( 1 ) conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective bargaining agreements ; ; ( 2 ) displacement of state law by federal law in state courts in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements ; ; or ( 3 ) _RARE_ of state court jurisdiction over these matters '' . STO
* The _RARE_ elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that _RARE_ purpose was merely to make unions _RARE_ . STO
* With a few exceptions , the _RARE_ seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction involved -- to say nothing of the _RARE_ of _RARE_ power to judges . STO
* To avoid these _RARE_ difficulties , Mr. Justice Frankfurter was prepared to read the _RARE_ provision as concerned with diversity , rather than federal question , jurisdiction . STO
* This would satisfy what presumably was _RARE_ major purpose -- the _RARE_ of unions . STO
* It would also leave intact the _RARE_ traditional authority in the realm of contract law . STO
* ( As we have seen , the _RARE_ and York decisions require federal courts in diversity cases to follow state _RARE_ rules . STO
* ) Here again Mr. Justice Frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of _RARE_ judicial legislation . STO
* If Congress wants to _RARE_ the states from areas which they have _RARE_ occupied , let it do so _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* And let it do its own _RARE_ and not leave that to federal judges . STO
* Does Lincoln Mills suggest that if Congress granted jurisdiction over _RARE_ divorce cases , the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the _RARE_ of marriages ? STO
* There is a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases . STO
* Congress has not clearly defined the _RARE_ between state and federal court competence . STO
* It has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a _RARE_ basis . STO
* A careful student has suggested that `` In any new _RARE_ ( of the _RARE_ Code ) the _RARE_ would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their _RARE_ in federal law might be used , leaving to the state _RARE_ the primary obligation of _RARE_ state law '' . STO
* Obviously , the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in Mr. Justice _RARE_ opinions -- to the extent that Congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion . STO
* The same rule of _RARE_ and division of labor _RARE_ him in the _RARE_ _RARE_ cases , in the administrative law area , and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review . STO
* Mr. Justice Black no doubt _RARE_ in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to achieve a generous and `` just '' result . STO
* He will not be `` _RARE_ by _RARE_ '' . STO
* Federal review of state decisions With few exceptions , Congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to enforce rights arising under federal law . STO
* To put it differently , state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right . STO
* To insure uniformity in the meaning of national law , however , state interpretations are subject to Supreme Court review . STO
* It may be noted , _RARE_ , that to _RARE_ `` desegregation '' an _RARE_ and former southern governor has urged Congress to _RARE_ this _RARE_ authority . STO
* The result , of course , would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states . STO
* It would also probably mean different things within the same state -- depending upon what court ( state or federal ) rendered decision . STO
* We consider here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial _RARE_ relationship . STO
* The first is that enforcement of national law in state litigation _RARE_ in reverse the old diversity _RARE_ of the relation of procedure to substance . STO
* _RARE_ to certain _RARE_ restraints in favor of fair trials , each level of government is free to _RARE_ its own judicial procedures . STO
* _RARE_ who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure . STO
* A similar _RARE_ applies to those who press state claims in federal _RARE_ , e.g. , in diversity cases . STO
* In an _RARE_ controversy the state court followed established state procedure by _RARE_ a vague _RARE_ `` most strongly against '' the _RARE_ . STO
* In other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the _RARE_ by state law . STO
* The result was that the _RARE_ case was dismissed . STO
* Mr. Justice Black led a _RARE_ majority : `` _RARE_ local rules of pleading cannot be used to _RARE_ unnecessary _RARE_ upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law '' . STO
* Here , as in the _RARE_ case , another element of state procedure was _RARE_ to federal _RARE_ law . STO
* _RARE_ Frankfurter and Jackson _RARE_ : `` One State may _RARE_ _RARE_ more than another , one State may be more _RARE_ than another to procedural _RARE_ . STO
* If a _RARE_ _RARE_ to enforce a Federal right in a State court , he cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are _RARE_ who press like claims arising under State law with regard to the form in which the claim must be stated -- the _RARE_ , for instance , with which a cause of action must be described . STO
* Federal law , though _RARE_ in a State court , _RARE_ the Federal claim -- _RARE_ what gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it . STO
* But the form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the State _RARE_ in the enforcement of like obligations created by it , so long as a requirement does not add to , or _RARE_ , the right as defined by Federal law , nor burden the realization of this right in the _RARE_ of litigation '' . STO
* Another problem in the area of _RARE_ relationships is this : what constitutes reversible error in a state decision ? STO
* _RARE_ v. Chicago involved a conviction for _RARE_ conduct under a local _RARE_ . STO
* The conduct in question was a speech . STO
* The accused did not object to the trial _RARE_ charge to the jury that _RARE_ `` may constitute a _RARE_ of the peace if it _RARE_ the public to anger , _RARE_ dispute , brings about a condition of _RARE_ . STO
* '' For present purposes it may be assumed that this charge so _RARE_ limited speech as to _RARE_ the federal _RARE_ . STO
* Though the accused raised many other objections , he did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings . STO
* That is , he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right . STO
* How else can one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to _RARE_ bond discount and _RARE_ ( section _RARE_ ) , but not the right to _RARE_ bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section _RARE_ ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section _RARE_ ) , but not allowing rapid _RARE_ of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a _RARE_ carryover to a personal holding company ( section _RARE_ ) , but not carryover of excess tax _RARE_ for foreign taxes ? STO
* These items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section _RARE_ . STO
* There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax _RARE_ or in terms of _RARE_ possibilities . STO
* With respect to items such as these the provisions of section _RARE_ , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or _RARE_ to the _RARE_ corporation . STO
* To this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning _RARE_ with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . STO
* It is not _RARE_ that section _RARE_ should _RARE_ the survival of all of the _RARE_ tax attributes . STO
* Such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly _RARE_ the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . STO
* _RARE_ claims Section 203 of the United States Code _RARE_ an assignment of a claim against the Government unless made after it has been allowed , the amount due has been _RARE_ , and a warrant for its payment has been issued . STO
* If it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions , this section would _RARE_ a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation , even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section _RARE_ . STO
* A clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation . STO
* The leading case , _RARE_ Air Line _RARE_ v. United States , held that the _RARE_ could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor , and it has been consistently followed . STO
* The Court said the purpose of the section was _RARE_ to spare the Government the _RARE_ and trouble of dealing with several parties , one of them a stranger to the claim , and to prevent traffic in claims , particularly _RARE_ claims , against the Government . STO
* Neither reason , said the Court , applied to the case at hand ; ; _RARE_ , Congress could not be presumed to have intended to _RARE_ _RARE_ approved by the states . STO
* Other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of _RARE_ , corporate _RARE_ , transfers by _RARE_ , or transfers by _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ are often classified as transfers by `` operation of law '' . STO
* A tax-free reorganization not _RARE_ with the merger or consolidation _RARE_ of the states involved is difficult to fit into an `` operation of law '' mold . STO
* Although it is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of assets for cash , to which section 203 quite clearly applies , the courts and Treasury have held that acquiring corporations in several types of _RARE_ _RARE_ may sue for refund of taxes paid by _RARE_ . STO
* A recent case in point is _RARE_ _RARE_ v. United States , in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership , whose partners were former stockholders , and then to another corporation formed by the partners . STO
* _RARE_ the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim , the Court _RARE_ the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ cases for the proposition that `` transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments _RARE_ by the statute '' . STO
* In an earlier case , _RARE_ & Co. v. United States , an American corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation in exchange for its own stock and then _RARE_ the British corporation . STO
* The _RARE_ statute was held not to prevent the American corporation from _RARE_ for a refund of taxes paid by the British corporation . STO
* The _RARE_ presumably would have qualified under section _RARE_ as a contractual reorganization , followed by a section _RARE_ liquidation , but not under section _RARE_ as a statutory merger of consolidation . STO
* The Court , nevertheless , relied on the _RARE_ case and also mentioned that the _RARE_ of the two corporations were the same . STO
* In substance , said the Court , there was no transfer of equitable title . STO
* The Treasury _RARE_ at substantially the same conclusion , but _RARE_ the problem of section 203 of the United States Code . STO
* Revenue _RARE_ _RARE_ provides that if the corporation against which a tax was _RARE_ has since been _RARE_ by merger with a successor corporation , a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax , followed by the name of the successor corporation . STO
* _RARE_ evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be filed . STO
* If the succession is a matter of public record , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of State or other public officials having _RARE_ of the documents will _RARE_ ; ; if the succession is not of record , all documents relating to such succession , properly certified , are required . STO
* The former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation , the latter to a contractual acquisition . STO
* The _RARE_ would not , however , apply to an acquisition of assets for cash . STO
* A recent _RARE_ , although rather _RARE_ , cites and follows Rev. _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization . STO
* Hence , a successor corporation in a C reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes paid by the _RARE_ corporation despite section 203 . STO
* In a B reorganization , followed by a section _RARE_ liquidation , those cases which hold that section 203 is _RARE_ to transfers in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes paid by the transferor . STO
* In fact , a cash purchase of a _RARE_ stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the _RARE_ doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step . STO
* These results appear sound . STO
* As stated in _RARE_ and numerous other cases , the two primary reasons for the _RARE_ of section 203 of the United States Code were to prevent the Government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of _RARE_ claims on a _RARE_ basis . STO
* The cases have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed . STO
* The first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section _RARE_ , which is the only type presently under discussion . STO
* Section _RARE_ applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent , a statutory merger or consolidation , an acquisition of substantially all a _RARE_ assets solely in exchange for voting stock , or a change of identity , form , or place of organization . STO
* In virtually every case the transferor corporation is _RARE_ , and its former stockholders either own _RARE_ , or have a continuing stock interest in , the assets which gave rise to the tax . STO
* In these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly remote . STO
* Furthermore , in a C reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger , to which the statute is clearly _RARE_ . STO
* Nor is it at all likely that a `` desperate '' claim against the Government will be assigned on a _RARE_ basis in the _RARE_ of a tax-free reorganization . STO
* If the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim , it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes . STO
* If such an unlikely _RARE_ were to take place , it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase , followed by the _RARE_ of the claim by the _RARE_ subsidiary , followed by liquidation . STO
* In the rare case where a _RARE_ only substantial _RARE_ , or its most important one , is a claim for refund , perhaps its transfer should not be permitted , whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock . STO
* It appears , then , that although the matter is not dealt with in section _RARE_ , a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section _RARE_ is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation . STO
* Section 203 of the United States Code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the Government transferred in tax-free _RARE_ . STO
* The successor corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims . STO
* Other tax attributes of the transferor There are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved . STO
* For example , property `` used in the trade or business '' of a transferor corporation , as defined in section _RARE_ , presumably would not _RARE_ its special status following a _RARE_ reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation . STO
* The parent of a group filing _RARE_ returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section _RARE_ , but as a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which had not , for example , elected to file _RARE_ returns with its own _RARE_ . STO
* Similar considerations presumably made it difficult to _RARE_ a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of _RARE_ ( section _RARE_ ) or depreciation ( section _RARE_ ) . STO
* Other sections of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code provide for survival of certain of a _RARE_ tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization . STO
* Section _RARE_ requires carryover of the transferor _RARE_ basis for property transferred , and section _RARE_ provides for _RARE_ on the _RARE_ holding period for such property to that of the _RARE_ . STO
* Section _RARE_ permits a person acquiring _RARE_ facilities to _RARE_ to continue _RARE_ over a _RARE_ period . STO
* However , a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section _RARE_ for a person acquiring emergency facilities . STO
* _RARE_ similar to a loss carryover . STO
* There may be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating _RARE_ and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items . STO
* For example , suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted , providing for carryover of excess profits _RARE_ . STO
* This carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover . STO
* It is an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of _RARE_ income ; ; it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which _RARE_ to have a high excess profits tax . STO
* Under the _RARE_ Code this item was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the _RARE_ _RARE_ case , but only over the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ Hand , who wrote the majority opinion in the _RARE_ case , a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a _RARE_ reorganization . STO
* Since this type of item was not in the statute when section _RARE_ was enacted in 1954 , one cannot say with certainty what effect the _RARE_ of that section should have . STO
* With respect to this type of item , one might properly apply the language of the Committee Report , quoted above , which _RARE_ against using section _RARE_ as a basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein . STO
* Actually , there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover . STO
* Probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax _RARE_ . STO
* A . STO
* _RARE_ for selecting mail questionnaire method There were two methods that could have been used for _RARE_ the study within the resources available : ( 1 ) interviews in depth with a few selected companies , and ( 2 ) the more limited _RARE_ of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire . STO
* While the method of _RARE_ a small number of companies was _RARE_ because of the opportunity it might have furnished to _RARE_ fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies . STO
* As a result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in _RARE_ some of the fundamental and _RARE_ problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government . STO
* It was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest _RARE_ inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature . STO
* It is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations . STO
* There is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents . STO
* _RARE_ `` yes '' or `` no '' answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various respondents may have . STO
* A respondent may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question . STO
* There is also the problem of the _RARE_ frame of reference . STO
* Is the respondent making a recommendation for his own benefit , for the benefit of his industry , for the benefit of a specific government department or service , for the benefit of the defense program , for the benefit of small business , or for the benefit of the _RARE_ ? STO
* There is also the question of whether the respondent based his answers on _RARE_ information and carefully considered judgment , or whether his answers were casual _RARE_ . STO
* Finally , there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held -- whether it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly over the _RARE_ . STO
* The research team was very _RARE_ of these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire . STO
* Under the circumstances , however , the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point . STO
* In the preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered , and the structure and _RARE_ used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations . STO
* B . STO
* _RARE_ of the questionnaire The questionnaire was designed to _RARE_ three types of information : ( 1 ) the facts regarding certain characteristics of the respondents , including their experience with , and interest in , securing defense business ; ; ( 2 ) the actual selling and buying practices of the respondents ; ; and ( 3 ) the attitudes and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and the methods of _RARE_ defense contracts . STO
* It was hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did . STO
* The major sections of the questionnaire ( see Appendix B ) are devoted to the following : 1 . STO
* _RARE_ for _RARE_ respondents ( Part A of the questionnaire ) 2 . STO
* _RARE_ of defense sales activities ( Part B of the questionnaire ) 3 . STO
* Respondents' practices in participating in advertised bidding for defense business ( Part C of the questionnaire ) 4 . STO
* Respondents' practices in participating in _RARE_ bidding for defense purposes ( Part D of the questionnaire ) 5 . STO
* Respondents' opinions regarding advertised bidding ( Part E of the questionnaire ) 6 . STO
* Respondents' opinions regarding _RARE_ bidding ( Part F of the questionnaire ) 7 . STO
* Respondents' _RARE_ regarding the methods of _RARE_ defense contracts ( Part G of the questionnaire ) The questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was _RARE_ . STO
* The questionnaire also stated that , in any event , all replies would be treated _RARE_ . STO
* It is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves . STO
* C . STO
* Preparation and _RARE_ of the questionnaire The research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months . STO
* In June , 1960 , an early draft of the questionnaire , along with a cover letter , was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of Washington . STO
* Several days after the companies had received the questionnaire , members of the research team _RARE_ the _RARE_ of eleven of these companies in person or by phone to discuss any _RARE_ or difficulties the _RARE_ might have experienced in _RARE_ the questionnaire . STO
* This test resulted in further _RARE_ of the questionnaire . STO
* The research team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of Washington might not be typical of those throughout the country , or that the results might be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made . STO
* Accordingly , another test of the _RARE_ was made . STO
* The revised draft was mailed in July , 1960 , to 100 firms throughout the United States . STO
* Fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from _RARE_ names submitted by member companies of the _RARE_ Industries Association ( AIA list ) and fifty were selected in a similar manner from a list of _RARE_ names compiled by the research team from the Thomas Register ( _RARE_ list ) . STO
* The method of _RARE_ the AIA and _RARE_ lists will be described later . STO
* Ten days after the questionnaires were mailed , follow-up _RARE_ _RARE_ were sent _RARE_ those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do so at once . STO
* _RARE_ returns in all were received . STO
* The responses were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the respondent . STO
* The cover letter , questionnaire , and follow-up _RARE_ were then revised into final form ( see _RARE_ A , B , and C ) . STO
* D . STO
* _RARE_ of mailing lists The objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs . STO
* The firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind . STO
* Three lists of companies were made and used in the study . STO
* The first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of Washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work . STO
* The primary consideration in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire with company officers . STO
* The second list was derived from a group of approximately _RARE_ names supplied to the research team by the _RARE_ Industries Association . STO
* These names were secured from member companies by the Association from the _RARE_ sources listed in Appendix Aj . STO
* Each source selected from its approved _RARE_ list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses that _RARE_ in the production of weapons and weapon support systems . STO
* Where possible , the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address . STO
* The _RARE_ lists supplied by the AIA member companies were _RARE_ and _RARE_ names were eliminated . STO
* There was further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive . STO
* The remaining names were then checked against the Thomas Register list ( see below ) and _RARE_ names were removed from the AIA lists . STO
* By these steps the final AIA list was reduced from _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* The third list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the Thomas Register . STO
* It was compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the _RARE_ Industries Association were _RARE_ different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs . STO
* Such a difference might have resulted from : 1 . STO
* The fact that the _RARE_ Industries Association members whose lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs . STO
* 2 . STO
* The fact that companies on the AIA lists were already participating in the defense program because of the manner of their selection . STO
* Accordingly , as `` _RARE_ '' , they might have different opinions and practices than an `` _RARE_ '' composed of those companies not so participating but interested in defense business . STO
* 3 . STO
* The fact that AIA lists might not have been selected on a random basis . STO
* The control sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of manufacturers in the Thomas Register . STO
* If the bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified , the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted . STO
* Fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion . STO
* E . STO
* _RARE_ the questionnaire Each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm . STO
* The questionnaires were mailed in _RARE_ , Washington , and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Washington . STO
* _RARE_ was used for the addresses outside the Pacific Northwest . STO
* Each letter contained a _RARE_ return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the Pacific Northwest , and by _RARE_ for those outside the Pacific Northwest . STO
* Approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed , a follow-up _RARE_ _RARE_ was sent to each of the original names . STO
* The first test mailing ( to 14 companies ) was made in June , 1960 . STO
* The second test mailing ( to 100 companies ) was made in July , 1960 . STO
* The final mailing of the questionnaire was made late in August , 1960 , to _RARE_ firms consisting of _RARE_ from the AIA list and _RARE_ from the _RARE_ list . STO
* F . STO
* _RARE_ received Over _RARE_ returns were received within two weeks after the final mailing was made . STO
* They continued to arrive until the end of December , 1960 , by which time a total of _RARE_ returns were received representing _RARE_ per cent of the _RARE_ questionnaires sent out . STO
* _RARE_ returns could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed . STO
* The remaining _RARE_ returns that were processed came from the categories in Table 2 . STO
* G . STO
* _RARE_ the returns Each questionnaire was _RARE_ for obvious _RARE_ and for comments , and was identified by a _RARE_ number , by the source list from which the company name was selected , and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the _RARE_ on the return envelope . STO
* All responses , except comments , were _RARE_ _RARE_ to permit use of _RARE_ equipment . STO
* The codes were _RARE_ into IBM _RARE_ cards and _RARE_ . STO
* Each return required three cards and involved key _RARE_ _RARE_ digital columns . STO
* In order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company each of the three cards _RARE_ the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate _RARE_ number of the respondent . STO
* The cards were then processed using standard IBM _RARE_ card equipment , including an IBM _RARE_ computer . STO
* The first step in processing was to analyze the returns from _RARE_ 1 , 2 , and 3 to determine whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses , in accordance with the _RARE_ contained in _RARE_ Section _RARE_ . STO
* ( see Chapter 2 . STO
* ) The results are shown in Table 3 . STO
* The returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms . STO
* The second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the AIA list with those from companies on the _RARE_ list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of the study . STO
* The methods and results of this comparative analysis are described in Appendix Aj . STO
* It was concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in , or _RARE_ to sell to , defense programs . STO
* In the first place , the two groups of firms , when combined , had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the AIA list alone . STO
* The vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world . STO
* During the summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic _RARE_ struggle . STO
* The _RARE_ in this economic struggle are the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Committee ( AWOC ) of the _RARE_ and the agricultural _RARE_ of the State . STO
* By virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of _RARE_ in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces . STO
* It is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have _RARE_ to maintain . STO
* We have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose . STO
* _RARE_ , one side was pleased and the other _RARE_ , regardless of how we ruled . STO
* Often the _RARE_ parties interpreted our decision as _RARE_ _RARE_ toward the other . STO
* We have _RARE_ ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an _RARE_ proceeding . STO
* It is _RARE_ , nevertheless , to read in a labor weekly , `` _RARE_ knuckles down to _RARE_ '' , and then to be confronted with a _RARE_ publication which states , `` _RARE_ recognizes obviously phony and _RARE_ strikes as _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* For a number of years , there have been _RARE_ attempts in California to organize farm workers . STO
* These attempts met with little _RARE_ for a variety of reasons . STO
* They were _RARE_ financed , without experienced leadership , and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole . STO
* This past year the pattern has been different : The _RARE_ program had the full support of the _RARE_ , which supplied staff and money to the AWOC , as well as moral support . STO
* _RARE_ was experienced and _RARE_ , and financial resources were significant . STO
* _RARE_ of where personal _RARE_ may lie as between the parties , failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life . STO
* As a result of these changed conditions , the impact of the _RARE_ effort on agricultural _RARE_ relations has been much greater than in the past . STO
* The AWOC has been able to _RARE_ the traditional weapons of labor -- the strike and the picket line -- with considerable success , particularly in the area of wages . STO
* By the very nature of the situation , it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management . STO
* To date , at least , the strategy of the AWOC has been selective ; ; that is to say , to concentrate on a particular _RARE_ or activity in a particular area at a strategic time , rather than any _RARE_ engagement with management throughout an area or the State . STO
* _RARE_ , we became involved in these _RARE_ because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program . STO
* _RARE_ , because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance , we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Code , although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility . STO
* But the current issues arose out of the Wagner-Peyser Act concerning referrals to an establishment where a labor dispute exists , and out of Public Law _RARE_ and the _RARE_ Labor Agreement if Mexican _RARE_ were employed at the ranch . STO
* Most of us remember and think of the Wagner-Peyser Act in its historical sense , as a major _RARE_ in the development of public placement services . STO
* _RARE_ do we think of it as a living , continuing , operating control over the system . STO
* However , when labor _RARE_ arise , its provisions come clearly into play . STO
* California has accepted the provisions of that Act ( as have all other States ) by _RARE_ into our Code ( Section _RARE_ ) a provision that The State of California _RARE_ the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act , and will observe and _RARE_ with the requirements of that act . STO
* With respect to labor _RARE_ , the Wagner-Peyser Act states only , In carrying out the provisions of this Act , the Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or _RARE_ to applicants before they are referred to employment . STO
* Other provisions of the Act _RARE_ the Secretary to _RARE_ regulations necessary to carry out its provisions , and he has done so . STO
* The pertinent regulation for our purposes is Section _RARE_ ( , ) , as follows : _RARE_ in labor dispute situations . STO
* No person shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which ( 1 ) is vacant because the former _RARE_ is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute , or ( 2 ) the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute . STO
* With respect to positions not covered by _RARE_ ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of this paragraph , any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists , provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral . STO
* In _RARE_ this regulation , let us take the last sentence first . STO
* It permits referrals under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute , provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute . STO
* _RARE_ , for example , a situation where a farm has a packing shed and fields . STO
* The packing shed workers go on strike . STO
* There is no dispute involving _RARE_ . STO
* We concluded that we may refer workers to the _RARE_ ( but not the packing shed work ) provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute . STO
* So far , no troublesome cases have _RARE_ under this provision . STO
* It is the first part of the Regulation that is currently at issue . STO
* Note that it _RARE_ referrals under either condition ( 1 ) or condition ( 2 ) . STO
* _RARE_ representatives have _RARE_ that the Secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a _RARE_ , on the grounds that the Wagner-Peyser Act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists . STO
* _RARE_ court The matter got into the courts this way : One of the early strikes called by the AWOC was at the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ County . STO
* We found that a labor dispute existed , and that the workers had left their jobs , which were then vacant because of the dispute . STO
* Accordingly , under clause ( 1 ) of the Secretary's Regulation , we suspended referrals to the employer . STO
* ( _RARE_ , no Mexican _RARE_ were involved . STO
* ) The employer , seeking to continue his _RARE_ , challenged our right to cease referrals to him , and sought relief in the Superior Court of _RARE_ County . STO
* The court issued a temporary restraining order , _RARE_ us to resume referrals . STO
* We , of course , _RARE_ the court order . STO
* However , the Attorney General of California , at the request of the Secretary of Labor , sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the Federal District Court , on grounds that it was predominantly a Federal issue since the validity of the Secretary's Regulation was being challenged . STO
* However , the Federal Court held that since the State had accepted the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act into its own Code , and presumably therefore also the regulations , it was now a State matter . STO
* It accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction , _RARE_ the California Superior Court made the restraining order permanent . STO
* Under that order , we have continued referring workers to the ranch . STO
* A similar case arose at the _RARE_ ranch in _RARE_ County , and the Superior Court of that county issued similar restraining orders . STO
* The _RARE_ have _RARE_ argued that I should have accepted the Superior Court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the Secretary's Regulation . STO
* I cannot accept that view , either as a lawyer or as an administrator . STO
* _RARE_ considerations First , let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved . STO
* It is an accepted _RARE_ principle in California that a Superior Court decision does not constitute a binding legal _RARE_ . STO
* It is conclusive , unless _RARE_ , only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard . STO
* It is not binding upon another Superior Court , which could rule to the contrary . STO
* Only when a decision is rendered by the District Court of _RARE_ ( or , of course , the Supreme Court ) is a binding _RARE_ established . STO
* In that event , we can correctly say that we have received an _RARE_ interpretation of the matter , and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be _RARE_ in other Superior _RARE_ . STO
* But over and beyond the _RARE_ need for a binding _RARE_ decision , I am convinced that the decisions of the Superior _RARE_ which in effect _RARE_ the Secretary's Regulation are not a correct interpretation of the Secretary's power under the Federal law . STO
* I believe I am in good company in this view . STO
* The Attorney General of California _RARE_ in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the District Court of _RARE_ . STO
* The Attorney General of the United States , in considering the power of the Secretary to issue similar regulations under the Wagner-Peyser Act relating to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of farm workers , has rendered an opinion _RARE_ his authority . STO
* Further , and as an evidence of legislative intent only , the Senate of the United States recently _RARE_ by a substantial majority the `` _RARE_ Amendment '' to the _RARE_ Labor _RARE_ Act , which would have specifically limited the _RARE_ authority of the Secretary in these matters . STO
* Next , let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our _RARE_ . STO
* There is far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ of the issue are enormous . STO
* A decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to _RARE_ situations , and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as _RARE_ . STO
* The public interest is so dominant in such an issue that I cannot be so _RARE_ as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two Superior _RARE_ in the State . STO
* It is an issue which may well reach the Supreme Court of the United States before judicial _RARE_ is achieved . STO
* As an administrator , I cannot place the _RARE_ Service in California in _RARE_ of being out of compliance with the Federal laws by my failure to pursue the _RARE_ of appeal open to me . STO
* To have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in Superior Court , in my opinion , would have placed us clearly out of compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor , were he so inclined , to notify the Governor of such _RARE_ , set a date for hearing , and issue his finding . STO
* The impact of _RARE_ under the Wagner-Peyser Act is clear : the _RARE_ of some _RARE_ million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or , as a _RARE_ , the taking over by the Federal Government of its operation . STO
* Thus far , the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is vacant due to a strike -- condition ( 1 ) in the Regulation of the Secretary . STO
* None has yet _RARE_ under condition ( 2 ) , relating to referral to jobs `` the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute '' . STO
* Here the problem is essentially one of _RARE_ the word `` filling '' . STO
* Should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job _RARE_ , union membership , union jurisdiction , and the like ? STO
* Or should it have a broader _RARE_ of including wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the mechanics of `` filling '' the job . STO
* Because of the uncertainty of this definition , I _RARE_ the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor . STO
* He has advised me that the _RARE_ interpretation is the proper one ; ; that is , that if wages , for example , is the only issue in a labor dispute , and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute , we may continue to make referrals . STO
* 9 . STO
* Martin and _RARE_ present evidence that _RARE_ and young children can and do _RARE_ many problems at a relatively simple _RARE_ level simply by _RARE_ objects and counting them . STO
* After they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of _RARE_ objects ; ; they do _RARE_ what they once had to do _RARE_ . STO
* The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age . STO
* One experiment showed the greatest _RARE_ difference occurring between the _RARE_ and _RARE_ years . STO
* 10 . STO
* Many studies indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science ; ; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden . STO
* _RARE_ characteristics How a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks _RARE_ him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics . STO
* A considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and _RARE_ child is not likely to do well in school subjects . STO
* _RARE_ maturity is the result of many factors , the principal ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child's life . STO
* However , the teacher who _RARE_ the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly _RARE_ in helping pupils gain confidence , security , and satisfaction . STO
* _RARE_ this responsibility of the teacher , suggestions for helping children gain better control of the emotions are presented in Chapter 11 . STO
* The following _RARE_ about the emotional characteristics of elementary-school children may be helpful . STO
* 1 . STO
* _RARE_ , the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short time , as _RARE_ to those of an adult . STO
* 2 . STO
* As the child grows older , his emotional reactions lead to `` _RARE_ '' , or emotional states drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly , rather than in short , abrupt outbursts . STO
* 3 . STO
* _RARE_ of the growth and decline of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects , noises , falling , and unexpected movement decline during the _RARE_ years , but that fears of the dark , of being alone , and of imaginary creatures or _RARE_ increase . STO
* 4 . STO
* _RARE_ a child for being afraid or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem ; ; more effective solutions include explanations , the example of another child , or conditioning by _RARE_ the feared object , place , or person with something pleasant . STO
* 5 . STO
* Children need help in learning to control their emotions . STO
* The young child learns from parents and teachers that _RARE_ _RARE_ , screaming , kicking , and hitting will not get him what he wants ; ; the older child learns that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his _RARE_ , and , therefore , makes a real effort to control his emotions . STO
* 6 . STO
* Children differ widely in their emotional responses . STO
* Among _RARE_ the patterns of emotional responses are similar ; ; as the influence of learning and environment are felt , emotional behavior becomes _RARE_ . STO
* Social characteristics Although no national norms exist for the social development of children , the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally _RARE_ by children at various age levels . STO
* The following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school children ; ; the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinating study of _RARE_ individuals , struggling to meet their developmental needs , and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the _RARE_ number of groups in which they hold membership . STO
* 1 . STO
* During early childhood , children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children ; ; after they have been in school a few years , their interest in _RARE_ of their own age increases , and their interest in adults decreases ; ; the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his parents on _RARE_ and family _RARE_ now _RARE_ it a bore . STO
* In late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase ; ; the group sets the styles in clothing , the kind of play engaged in , and the _RARE_ of right and wrong behavior . STO
* 2 . STO
* In early childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older , who can do the things he likes to do ; ; such factors as sex , intelligence , and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time . STO
* 3 . STO
* In later childhood , an interest in team games replaces individual play ; ; _RARE_ to the group , a feeling of _RARE_ over those who are not members , and _RARE_ to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant _RARE_ . STO
* 4 . STO
* During early childhood boys _RARE_ and _RARE_ , on the average , more than girls ; ; those who feel _RARE_ or _RARE_ engage in these activities more than do _RARE_ children . STO
* 5 . STO
* During late childhood boys like to _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and talk smart to girls ; ; girls , who are more mature than boys , _RARE_ upon the _RARE_ _RARE_ of boys of their own age . STO
* 6 . STO
* By the time pupils reach the sixth grade , their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed ; ; they exhibit a keen interest in social , political , and economic problems , but they frequently have vague and _RARE_ notions about the terms they use rather _RARE_ in their routine school work . STO
* 7 . STO
* Between the ages of two and four years , _RARE_ or resistance to adult authority is noticeable ; ; after the fourth year it begins to decline . STO
* However , as we have seen , in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the _RARE_ group for those of parents and teachers . STO
* 8 . STO
* The elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups . STO
* The child in the primary grades can play _RARE_ with one companion , but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger ; ; he wants to be with people , but he hasn't yet learned to _RARE_ . STO
* In the middle grades , however , he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader , helping to make plans and carry on group activities , and setting up rules governing the enterprise . STO
* Why the teacher should study the individual pupil Much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children , yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program . STO
* Some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit ; ; others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom . STO
* These children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand . STO
* Many school systems now _RARE_ school _RARE_ and child guidance specialists . STO
* These specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention , by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom , and by providing clinical services for severely _RARE_ children . STO
* It is the classroom teacher , however , who has daily contacts with pupils , and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice . STO
* Indeed , a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the elementary-school teacher , rather than merely an additional _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ in many elementary schools have assumed that _RARE_ the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores _RARE_ the problem of meeting the needs of individuals . STO
* What they should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success , and that they still must be treated as individuals . STO
* Although the teacher must be concerned with maintaining standards , he must also be concerned about understanding differences in ability , background , and experience . STO
* _RARE_ that inhibit learning and lead to maladjustment _RARE_ conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are _RARE_ emotionally , and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects . STO
* One study , which involved _RARE_ pupils in grades one to six , found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously _RARE_ and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity . STO
* It is apparent , therefore , that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children . STO
* When a child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning , _RARE_ , unhappiness , and other forms of maladjustment frequently follow . STO
* These _RARE_ in turn inhibit learning , and a vicious cycle is completed . STO
* It is easy for the teacher to _RARE_ that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy , or that the child who _RARE_ interest in school , who _RARE_ the teacher , or who is _RARE_ is a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The causes of _RARE_ and maladjustment may be found in physical factors , such as _RARE_ speech or hearing , _RARE_ vision , _RARE_ motor coordination , a frail _RARE_ , chronic disease , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* They may be caused by poor health habits , such as _RARE_ eating and sleeping habits . STO
* They may be related to mental _RARE_ or lack of _RARE_ for certain types of school work . STO
* The curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others . STO
* _RARE_ methods , learning materials , and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to _RARE_ for some children . STO
* _RARE_ family relations , broken homes , and _RARE_ community influences may also be contributing factors . STO
* This is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children . STO
* Moreover , these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner . STO
* A vision _RARE_ that may produce nervous tension and reading _RARE_ for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading . STO
* An _RARE_ home that may _RARE_ one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school . STO
* At any rate , the teacher who recognizes common causes of _RARE_ and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil _RARE_ , failure , and maladjustment . STO
* Sources of information about children _RARE_ teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he _RARE_ as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being _RARE_ by various factors in his environment . STO
* The classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as _RARE_ in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical _RARE_ ; ; he cannot be expected to _RARE_ all the tests and gather all the information needed about each child in his classroom . STO
* He can be expected , however , to examine and interpret the information already available ; ; to _RARE_ and extend his own techniques for studying individual children ; ; and to utilize opportunities , arising in connection with regular classroom activities , for gaining a better understanding of his pupils . STO
* This section deals with some of the sources of information that can be _RARE_ by the classroom teacher ; ; Chapter 15 provides more detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil progress . STO
* _RARE_ records Most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils . STO
* These records , when systematically maintained , provide much information about the children , which the teacher can use in guidance , instruction , _RARE_ , and reporting to parents . STO
* Each teacher has in his classroom a metal file , equipped with a lock , which is used to store cumulative record _RARE_ . STO
* During summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the principal . STO
* Only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records . STO
* Each new teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date . STO
* Some school systems provide written instructions to _RARE_ and teachers _RARE_ when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be summarized and used . STO
* The Summary Report On Desegregation _RARE_ In Education In The _RARE_ Region , 1959 - 1960 '' clearly shows two pieces of information . STO
* The Summary Report , which was prepared for this Conference , indicates , first , that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing ; ; second , that both actual and pending desegregation is , with few exceptions , the product or result of court order . STO
* The Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow . STO
* The _RARE_ Region , as defined by the National Association of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia . STO
* The states and the _RARE_ _RARE_ all have some desegregation , in fact some _RARE_ back to 1954 ; ; but the region also _RARE_ some of the _RARE_ opposition . STO
* Desegregation has been opposed by massive resistance , _RARE_ , pupil assignment ( with no assignments of Negro children ) , and hate _RARE_ . STO
* Desegregation and court order Now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order . STO
* First Kentucky . STO
* _RARE_ school desegregation came to Owen and Union _RARE_ , which already had high school desegregation . STO
* The action was a result of a court order , the _RARE_ for which ( and for other court action mentioned in this paper ) is taken from the Summary Report for this Conference . STO
* In Maryland the _RARE_ County Board of Education had prepared a desegregation plan which the Court approved but which a plaintiff had challenged ; ; thus , county school board and Federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation . STO
* Additional school desegregation in Tennessee resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel . STO
* Similarly , further desegregation may come from suits pending in three Tennessee cities , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* In West Virginia the number of white and Negro children _RARE_ the same school has increased almost _RARE_ . STO
* There are no court decisions here . STO
* As in Maryland , a District court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in Delaware . STO
* As a result of the State Board of Education plan , Negro children entered _RARE_ white elementary schools in five districts . STO
* The Third _RARE_ Court of _RARE_ is _RARE_ an appeal from the plan . STO
* In Virginia court orders led to desegregation in _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Desegregation in _RARE_ County is pending because of court order , although date of admission is not yet determined . STO
* Negro parents have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Warren _RARE_ . STO
* Desegregation can also result from additional suits brought by Negro _RARE_ against school boards in Newport News , _RARE_ County , _RARE_ County , and _RARE_ . STO
* As a school district , the District of Columbia has had desegregated schools since 1954 , shortly after the Supreme Court decision . STO
* This _RARE_ makes it clear that school desegregation continues , including the Old _RARE_ State , in spite of its stern resistance . STO
* The record is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court order ; ; that on the immediate horizon , if further large-scale ( relatively speaking ) desegregation comes , it will result from court orders on suits filed in several _RARE_ states . STO
* _RARE_ that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a _RARE_ in _RARE_ leads to a conclusion that _RARE_ is slow . STO
* Before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this _RARE_ Conference , I wish to note a small item in the Summary Report as it refers to the District of Columbia . STO
* That reference in the Report is `` continuation of the trend toward an all-Negro school system '' , a remark apparently _RARE_ by the increase of Negro school population from _RARE_ per cent to _RARE_ per cent . STO
* I see no real prospects for an all-Negro school population . STO
* West of Rock _RARE_ _RARE_ is still _RARE_ white and is in fact increasingly white as a result of _RARE_ _RARE_ housing program . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ Bottom is _RARE_ Negroes . STO
* The large _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ area _RARE_ white people -- what with _RARE_ town houses and elevator apartments . STO
* The Capitol Hill rehabilitation , like _RARE_ Bottom , replaces Negroes with whites ( but also replaces some whites with other whites ) . STO
* The _RARE_ break with tradition , the past and present of `` White _RARE_ _RARE_ a Black _RARE_ '' , may come with the opening of nearby _RARE_ County suburbs to Negro residents and , presumably , the consequent conclusion of some whites that they cannot escape the Negro by fleeing to the suburbs . STO
* In fact , short of fleeing to _RARE_ , Virginia , or _RARE_ , Maryland , white people may have to live with Negroes . STO
* All of this must be taken into account before the image of an `` all-Negro '' D.C. public school system is _RARE_ up . STO
* _RARE_ to _RARE_ From the Summary Report before us at this Conference , a number of problems are apparent . STO
* They _RARE_ us and _RARE_ us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems . STO
* First , how can we step up the desegregation movement ? STO
* It is slow . STO
* I believe we all want more schools where white and Negro together can and do attend . STO
* I believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color . STO
* In general , members of _RARE_ would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence _RARE_ . STO
* How to achieve this objective is a problem , but we are not divided on what we want . STO
* Second , as we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves , how can we achieve this action through school board action ? STO
* It may be county school board or state school board action , as well as that of municipal school boards . STO
* _RARE_ , can we reduce the role of the district courts , so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court ? STO
* This is a problem , and I believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should _RARE_ and effect a plan of desegregation . STO
* Third , how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools ? STO
* Not simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but a continuing program that also _RARE_ integration , that _RARE_ the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or Negro , but as human beings . STO
* Again the problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education ; ; not whether it should be done . STO
* Fourth , in the segregated school system , during the period before desegregation , how can we assure equal opportunity ? STO
* In fact , in the desegregated school system which may have a good many schools with all-Negro population , how can we assure equal opportunity ? STO
* This is a problem , but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence . STO
* Fifth , in the segregated school system or in the all-Negro or _RARE_ schools , how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the group ? STO
* Can we help children adjust to `` images of other children '' when the latter are not actually present . STO
* Now , the issues If we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively united fashion , then there are twice as many issues which , I judge , sharply divide us , _RARE_ relations _RARE_ and lay people . STO
* Issue no. 1 . STO
* _RARE_ assignment . STO
* Since on the one hand school desegregation has come in Virginia _RARE_ with pupil assignment , shall we support the plan ? STO
* On the basis of pupil assignment criteria , _RARE_ Albert _RARE_ has assigned Negro children to _RARE_ white schools in _RARE_ and _RARE_ , Virginia . STO
* Shall we support pupil assignment ? STO
* On the other hand , looking at the larger picture , is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off , blocked , or reduced school desegregation to a `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Shall we therefore _RARE_ the plan ? STO
* This question is an issue because it likely divides us into two camps -- those for or against pupil assignment . STO
* Issue no. 2 . STO
* _RARE_ assignment in order to _RARE_ . STO
* In large cities like Baltimore , _RARE_ , and Washington , D.C. , should school desegregation be extended to all-Negro and _RARE_ schools by _RARE_ white and Negro teachers , respectively ? STO
* On the one hand do we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that a child not be denied admission to a school on account of his race ? STO
* Or should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an _RARE_ school , we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school -- namely , to a teacher of another race . STO
* We can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation . STO
* Issue no. 3 . STO
* The plaintiff in school desegregation cases . STO
* The earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation . STO
* In each instance the plaintiff was a private citizen . STO
* In thousands of school districts , indeed , in the entire State of _RARE_ , no plaintiff has come forth . STO
* And I have established that the action of municipal , county , or state school boards or boards of education is small , _RARE_ small in comparison with the number of districts . STO
* Is the requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement ? STO
* Should Congress _RARE_ the Attorney General to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance ? STO
* Even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the Attorney General to act was eliminated , should we nevertheless support such a clause ? STO
* This is an issue , for it divides people rather sharply . STO
* Issue no. 4 . STO
* _RARE_ of funds to schools that deny children on account of race . STO
* This is the Powell Amendment , which in 1957 divided even a `` liberal '' group like the American _RARE_ Committee ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* Should we support a clause in Federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny Federal funds to a school district that _RARE_ admission to a child on account of his race ? STO
* This is _RARE_ than earlier Powell _RARE_ which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts . STO
* There is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause , _RARE_ though it be , on the grounds that Federal aid is so necessary to the public schools . STO
* The Federal funds _RARE_ _RARE_ the support of many , the opposition of quite a few . STO
* Issue no. 5 . STO
* _RARE_ public education . STO
* Should a political _RARE_ , state or county or _RARE_ , be required to furnish public education ? STO
* For the school year , _RARE_ , the _RARE_ Edward County ( Virginia ) Board of _RARE_ voted not to provide funds for public education , and the school board therefore could provide no public education -- for white or Negro children . STO
* Is public education in this American democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education ? STO
* Or is this subject a matter of _RARE_ , a matter of states rights or county rights ? STO
* If people don't want to provide public education , should they be forced to do so ? STO
* Even if we marshal substantial agreement behind _RARE_ public education , we likely cannot expect that all the states will enact the legislation . STO
* Should the requirement , which must therefore be Federal in nature , be _RARE_ by the United States Congress ? STO
* Or must it become law by _RARE_ of the United States _RARE_ ? STO
* We actually have two issues in this question -- goal and method . STO
* Issue no. 6 . STO
* Federal responsibility for education of the citizens . STO
* If the above issue is settled by requiring public education for all citizens , Issue No. 6 may be _RARE_ . STO
* If , on the other hand , it is not settled , or while it is being _RARE_ and resolved , does the Federal government have a responsibility in situations like that in _RARE_ Edward County ? STO
* _RARE_ half the children still receive no education . STO
* _RARE_ or should the Federal government help ? STO
* Should the government directly provide education for the children who want public education ? STO
* The next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational _RARE_ . STO
* On the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . STO
* _RARE_ is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . STO
* A hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for _RARE_ youth . STO
* In situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . STO
* _RARE_ studied the records of _RARE_ school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found `` little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence '' , as judged by a panel of professional _RARE_ who studied the voting records on educational issues . STO
* The few cases of clear _RARE_ along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for _RARE_ rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . STO
* In general , it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society . STO
* There have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy . STO
* If there were more such cases , it would be easier to answer the question whether the _RARE_ favor their own social classes . STO
* There is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged . STO
* This is the issue of segregated schools in the South . STO
* In this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than social-class groups . STO
* Thus , the white middle and lower classes are _RARE_ against the Negro middle and lower classes . STO
* This conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white lower-class people . STO
* If this happens , there may be some class conflict in the South , with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position . STO
* The educational profession The members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy , their position being strongest in the universities . STO
* They are mostly _RARE_ and _RARE_ people , with a few in the upper class . STO
* Do they make _RARE_ decisions ? STO
* In a society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which _RARE_ and _RARE_ these social values , it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society . STO
* There is no problem here . STO
* The problem arises , if it does arise , when the _RARE_ has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence , but which bears some relation to the social structure . STO
* For instance , in giving school grades or in making recommendations for the award of a college scholarship , does he consciously or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class ? STO
* Again , in deciding on the content and method of his teaching , does he favor a curriculum which will make his students stronger _RARE_ in the race for higher economic status , or does he favor a curriculum which _RARE_ students in other ways ? STO
* The answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the _RARE_ own social-class position and also upon his social history , as well as upon his personality and what he _RARE_ his mission to be as an _RARE_ . STO
* In a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class _RARE_ , _RARE_ illustrates a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the _RARE_ personality as well as on his social-class background . STO
* One _RARE_ teacher may be a hard _RARE_ for lower-class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb , while another _RARE_ teacher may be a very _RARE_ person with lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and _RARE_ at home , and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment . STO
* One social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban lower-class and _RARE_ families . STO
* Their own experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers . STO
* While this influence is a complex matter , depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience , there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth . STO
* _RARE_ who have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them ; ; that is , they are likely to favor a kind of education that has _RARE_ value . STO
* This does not necessarily mean that such teachers will favor vocational education , as _RARE_ with liberal education , but they are likely to favor an approach to liberal education which has a _RARE_ _RARE_ value , as against a kind of `` pure '' liberal education that is not designed to help people get better jobs . STO
* There is no doubt that higher education since World War 2 , has moved away from `` pure '' liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and _RARE_ . STO
* There are several causes for this , one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training . STO
* But another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ with the college and university faculty members of the period from 1900 to _RARE_ , the new postwar faculty members consist of more children of _RARE_ and more children of urban _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Their experience is quite in contrast with that of children of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ parents , who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational _RARE_ in the curriculum . STO
* The `` public interest '' groups _RARE_ policies are formed by several groups who are officially or _RARE_ appointed to act in the public interest . STO
* _RARE_ are one such group , and state _RARE_ have major responsibility for educational legislation . STO
* They generally vote so as to serve their own _RARE_ , and if the _RARE_ should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class , they might be expected to vote and work for _RARE_ or for lower-class interests in education . STO
* However , there are relatively few such political _RARE_ , and , as has been pointed out , there is seldom a clear-cut distinction between the educational interests of one social class and those of another . STO
* Another public interest group is the commission of _RARE_ or _RARE_ which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations . STO
* _RARE_ these _RARE_ work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society , as they conceive it . STO
* Nevertheless , their conclusions and recommendations cannot please everybody , and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view . STO
* For instance , there have been two Presidential _RARE_ on higher education since World War 2 . STO
* President _RARE_ Commission on _RARE_ Education tended to take a liberal , _RARE_ position , while President _RARE_ Committee on Education Beyond the High School was slightly more conservative . STO
* Both _RARE_ consisted of _RARE_ and _RARE_ people , who attempted to act in the public interest . STO
* An example of a more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the Commission on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ Education sponsored by the Association of American _RARE_ and supported by the _RARE_ Foundation and the _RARE_ Corporation . STO
* This Commission recommended against the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities and against a broad program of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This might be said to be an _RARE_ or an _RARE_ bias , but the Commission published as one of its staff studies a book by Byron S. _RARE_ entitled Who Should Go To College ? STO
* Which recommended a federal government scholarship program . STO
* Furthermore , the Commission set up the Council for Financial _RARE_ to Education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education . STO
* Thus , the Commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education . STO
* Then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational _RARE_ , who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs , experiments , and _RARE_ . STO
* These people are practically always _RARE_ or _RARE_ persons , who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society . STO
* Finally there are the parent organizations and the _RARE_ organizations such as the National Association of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ Committee on Public _RARE_ . STO
* These have an _RARE_ leadership and a middle-class membership , with rare exceptions , where _RARE_ parents are active in local _RARE_ matters . STO
* Like the other _RARE_ groups , these are middle class in their educational attitudes , and they attempt to act in the general public interest , as they see it . STO
* In general , it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who _RARE_ to act in the interests of the society as a whole . STO
* They are predominantly _RARE_ and _RARE_ people , and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes . STO
* They may be unaware of the existence of lower-class values and consequently fail to take them into account . STO
* But there is very little _RARE_ and conscious _RARE_ of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education . STO
* They think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society . STO
* _RARE_ to influence social structure through education _RARE_ policy in the United States has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity . STO
* In so far as this goal is achieved , the society becomes more fluid , artificial barriers to social _RARE_ are reduced , and people at the lower end of the social _RARE_ share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society . STO
* On the other hand , there is a _RARE_ purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children . STO
* This leads to efforts at _RARE_ through private schools and to the maintenance of social _RARE_ in the schools . STO
* Both of these purposes exist side by side without much _RARE_ conflict under present conditions . STO
* _RARE_ economic and cultural opportunity The broad expansion of free education results both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promoting _RARE_ within the social structure . STO
* Fifty years ago the general raising of the _RARE_ age to sixteen was an example of this movement . STO
* During the past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities , state colleges , and community colleges . STO
* The _RARE_ of American faith in the comprehensive high school , as expressed in the _RARE_ study , is another indication of the _RARE_ of the ideal of _RARE_ opportunity through the _RARE_ of educational opportunity . STO
* The recent federal _RARE_ _RARE_ program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to _RARE_ youth . STO
* It is probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade , because the scholarship programs mainly aided the students with the best academic records ( who were usually middle-class ) , and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges . STO
* Meanwhile , the private colleges have increased their _RARE_ rates so much that they have raised an economic barrier which _RARE_ their scholarship funds . STO
* The gains in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions . STO
* Unfortunately , however , and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely _RARE_ as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . STO
* And this fact may explain some of the _RARE_ among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . STO
* One such _RARE_ , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the _RARE_ of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . STO
* Here , the choice is that between the _RARE_ of a dilemma . STO
* Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . STO
* The _RARE_ type Despite an _RARE_ due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above _RARE_ of fully distributed _RARE_ goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . STO
* For more explicit _RARE_ , one must distinguish different types of analyses . STO
* By all means the most important distinction is that between those _RARE_ _RARE_ which _RARE_ a distribution of _RARE_ _RARE_ cost _RARE_ on estimates of _RARE_ or marginal costs , and those other _RARE_ which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere _RARE_ distribution . STO
* The first , or _RARE_ , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the _RARE_ Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission . STO
* The _RARE_ Section _RARE_ between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter . STO
* The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` long-run _RARE_ costs '' -- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the _RARE_ `` long-run marginal costs '' . STO
* There remains a _RARE_ of total costs , or total `` revenue requirements '' which , since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density , is strictly _RARE_ on a _RARE_ basis . STO
* Nevertheless , because the _RARE_ Section has felt _RARE_ to make some kind of a distribution of total costs , it has apportioned this _RARE_ , which it sometimes calls `` burden '' , among the units of _RARE_ traffic on a basis ( partly _RARE_ , partly _RARE_ ) which is _RARE_ quite arbitrary from the _RARE_ of cost determination . STO
* In recent years , this burden ( which includes _RARE_ for revenue _RARE_ in the passenger business and in _RARE_ freight traffic ! STO
* ) has _RARE_ to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the _RARE_ freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet . STO
* Since this book is concerned only _RARE_ with railroad rates , it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated _RARE_ costs and apportioned _RARE_ costs . STO
* _RARE_ it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is _RARE_ . STO
* But in any event , full credit should be given to the _RARE_ Section for its express and _RARE_ recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in _RARE_ analyses : namely , that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ; and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly _RARE_ from the _RARE_ of specific cost determination . STO
* 2 . STO
* The _RARE_ type We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which , unlike the `` railroad type '' , draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment : the _RARE_ type . STO
* It might be called the `` public utility '' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases . STO
* Here no attempt is made , first to determine _RARE_ or marginal costs and then to _RARE_ on these costs `` reasonably distributed '' _RARE_ of total costs . STO
* Instead , all of the total costs are treated as variable costs , although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables . STO
* Moreover , whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission _RARE_ `` variable cost '' means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output , in the type of analysis now under review `` variable cost '' has been used more _RARE_ , so as to cover costs which , while a function of some one variable ( such as output of energy , or number of customers ) , are not necessarily a linear function . STO
* As already noted in an earlier paragraph , the more familiar cost analyses of utility _RARE_ or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service , such as residential , commercial , industrial power , street lighting , etc. . STO
* This `` grand division '' permits many costs to be assigned in their _RARE_ to some one class , such as street lighting , or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes . STO
* _RARE_ industrial power service , for example , would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the _RARE_ distribution lines . STO
* But the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all , or nearly all , classes of customers ; ; and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be _RARE_ among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates . STO
* The general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly _RARE_ problem of an _RARE_ cost analysis . STO
* But before turning to this example , we must distinguish two _RARE_ of analysis , both of which belong to the _RARE_ type rather than to the _RARE_ type . STO
* In the first _RARE_ , the _RARE_ ( following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect ) _RARE_ both total operating costs and total annual capital costs ( including an allowance for `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' ) among the different classes and units of service . STO
* Here , an apportionment , say , of _RARE_ of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential _RARE_ . STO
* But in the second _RARE_ , which I take to be the one more frequently applied , only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital '' or `` fair return '' are apportioned directly among the various classes of service . STO
* To be sure , the capital _RARE_ in ( or , _RARE_ , the estimated `` fair values '' of ) the plant and equipment are apportioned among the different classes , as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services . STO
* But any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs _RARE_ to this class is reported as a `` return '' realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service . STO
* Thus , during any given year ( A ) if the revenues from the residential service are _RARE_ , ( B ) if the operating expenses _RARE_ to this class of service come to _RARE_ , and ( C ) if the net investment in ( or value of ) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to _RARE_ , the cost _RARE_ will report that residential service , in the aggregate , has yielded a return of _RARE_ or _RARE_ per cent . STO
* Other services will show different rates of return , some probably much lower and some higher . STO
* There are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital '' from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service -- _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' . STO
* But the practice is likely to be _RARE_ , since it may seem to support a conclusion that , as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the _RARE_ operating expenses plus some return on capital investment , however low , the rates of charge for this service are _RARE_ . STO
* Needless to say , any such inference would be quite _RARE_ . STO
* For the reason just suggested , I shall assume the use of the first _RARE_ of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following _RARE_ example . STO
* That is to say , an allowance for `` cost of capital '' will be assumed to be included directly in the cost apportionment . STO
* _RARE_ analysis of the costs of an electric utility business In order to simplify the _RARE_ of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own _RARE_ plant . STO
* Let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service , all of which is supplied at the same voltage , phase , etc. to residential , commercial , and industrial customers . STO
* This latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most _RARE_ aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of _RARE_ of the same service measured along different dimensions . STO
* Since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service , we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple ; ; indeed , that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business , followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per _RARE_ of consumption . STO
* In fact , however , the problem is not so simple . STO
* For a statement of costs per _RARE_ would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of _RARE_ output ( or consumption ) of energy . STO
* A recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required . STO
* The _RARE_ division , and the one most frequently used ( with _RARE_ ) in gas and electric rate cases , is a _RARE_ division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs '' , `` energy '' or `` _RARE_ costs '' , and `` demand '' or `` capacity '' costs . STO
* If this _RARE_ division of costs were to have its _RARE_ in the actual rates of charge for service , as it actually does have in some rates , there would result a _RARE_ rate for any one class of service . STO
* For example , the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge , a _RARE_ charge for _RARE_ _RARE_ of energy at per _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ charge for a maximum demand of 2 _RARE_ during the month at the rate of $1 per _RARE_ -- a total bill of _RARE_ for that month . STO
* But our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service , and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs . STO
* Let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn , _RARE_ that this _RARE_ classification is used only for _RARE_ purposes ; ; costs actually vary in much more complex ways . STO
* 1 . STO
* The customer costs These are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless , or almost regardless , of power consumption . STO
* _RARE_ as a minimum are the costs of _RARE_ and _RARE_ along with whatever other expenses the company must _RARE_ in taking on another consumer . STO
* These minimum costs may come to $1 per month , more or less , for residential and small commercial customers , although they are substantially higher for large industrial users , who require more _RARE_ connections and _RARE_ devices . STO
* While costs on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates , in the form of a mere `` service charge '' , they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which _RARE_ the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment . STO
* But the really _RARE_ aspect of _RARE_ _RARE_ arises because of the cost _RARE_ frequent practice of including , not just those costs that can be definitely _RARE_ as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary ( _RARE_ ) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity . STO
* The _RARE_ of sociology have remained largely _RARE_ by the _RARE_ . STO
* Like primitive numbers in _RARE_ , the entire _RARE_ framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . STO
* But what is the operational worth of a sociology which _RARE_ _RARE_ the idea of physical models ? STO
* Is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred _RARE_ in social science ? STO
* It has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by _RARE_ mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which _RARE_ a _RARE_ price for technological _RARE_ . STO
* This push to _RARE_ the study of mass _RARE_ to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology _RARE_ close to the reduction of the word `` mass '' to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied . STO
* ( cf. _RARE_ , 1959 : : _RARE_ 11 . STO
* ) Here I think the role of the _RARE_ becomes apparent . STO
* The simple _RARE_ success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned . STO
* For if the small group notion involves the _RARE_ claim that the phenomena of _RARE_ investigations are of atomic or _RARE_ proportions , the _RARE_ needs to know the extent to which such _RARE_ are valid . STO
* The mere exploration of the unconscious ground of _RARE_ sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation . STO
* ( cf. _RARE_ , 1959 : : _RARE_ 12 . STO
* ) A parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between _RARE_ _RARE_ received and conceptions logically formed . STO
* _RARE_ can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially _RARE_ categories . STO
* This involves a _RARE_ of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement . STO
* _RARE_ functional sociology may have great practical use in the study of different _RARE_ , yet it is perfectly clear , as _RARE_ ( 1957 : : _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ ( 1959 : : _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) indicate , that the concept of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological models , in which the notions of _RARE_ , i.e. , metaphysical purpose , are central . STO
* ( cf. Chapter 9 . STO
* ) _RARE_ as a _RARE_ credo is , therefore , not a direct consequence of observations , but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference and judgment . STO
* The purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is not to _RARE_ but to _RARE_ the principles of social science . STO
* It is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise to sociology , since the former is a logical , rational discipline , where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical . STO
* Such a position _RARE_ the _RARE_ of philosophy in its _RARE_ form as something _RARE_ above and _RARE_ the empirical and mathematical sciences . STO
* But contrary to _RARE_ , philosophy is not a _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* The uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are _RARE_ to any approach that does not _RARE_ to pure _RARE_ . STO
* However , when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences , to _RARE_ the conditions of empirical research , it becomes formal metaphysics ; ; _RARE_ the contours of life to fit the needs of _RARE_ . STO
* The notion of philosophy as _RARE_ _RARE_ may fit well with _RARE_ _RARE_ of political _RARE_ , but it has been noted that the price of such an _RARE_ notion of philosophy is the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the social sciences . STO
* ( cf. _RARE_ , 1952 : : _RARE_ 2 , _RARE_ 5 ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* ) _RARE_ is no longer a direct _RARE_ with nature as it was in _RARE_ . STO
* It has _RARE_ any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of _RARE_ , as in _RARE_ system ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* Science is _RARE_ for _RARE_ to know nothing of Nothing , in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense of men . STO
* It is not _RARE_ which has isolated metaphysics from reality by _RARE_ between description and _RARE_ . STO
* It is simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century . STO
* Consider the traditional `` four fields '' of philosophy : logic , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* It is a commonplace that to the degree these special _RARE_ of past philosophic hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable _RARE_ criteria , they move away from philosophy as such . STO
* What is left to traditional systems of philosophy is , in effect , only the history of these fields prior to their becoming _RARE_ enough to _RARE_ by the _RARE_ of scientific method . STO
* In this situation , philosophy has survived by _RARE_ itself from metaphysics , by showing the ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions . STO
* The _RARE_ by philosophy of _RARE_ claims to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of its _RARE_ attitude to knowledge of more humble _RARE_ . STO
* In the new situation , philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that _RARE_ offers the physical sciences , a reservoir of logical relations that can be used in _RARE_ _RARE_ having _RARE_ and _RARE_ value . STO
* Beyond this , philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry , but within its potential _RARE_ of relevance . STO
* In this connection , it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science were _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ hypothesis , according to which the solar system was _RARE_ from a rotating mass of _RARE_ gas , nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by _RARE_ in his _RARE_ Du _RARE_ . STO
* This does not mean that philosophy _RARE_ the problems it _RARE_ , any more so than _RARE_ geometry settled the physical status of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But the _RARE_ presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a _RARE_ task . STO
* To those raised on _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , this may seem a modest role for philosophy . STO
* However , _RARE_ and _RARE_ are different qualities . STO
* _RARE_ conceived of as _RARE_ to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which _RARE_ as the sciences _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has _RARE_ since its primitive _RARE_ status offers a more _RARE_ sort of drama . STO
* By _RARE_ fundamental _RARE_ in the social sciences , and _RARE_ the logical problems _RARE_ at the _RARE_ of each new scientific discipline , philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can _RARE_ growth in human understanding . STO
* _RARE_ can prevent the working _RARE_ from becoming _RARE_ and _RARE_ by _RARE_ the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed . STO
* The _RARE_ of scientific theory , the examination of a theory from the _RARE_ of language , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge , no less so because of its removal from empirical research . STO
* The realm of science , whatever the degree of precision in formulations , covers the range of _RARE_ and explanation . STO
* ( cf. _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1948 : : _RARE_ - 75 . STO
* ) Whatever philosophy is conceived to be , its _RARE_ , _RARE_ attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is something other than science . STO
* For some forms of philosophy , this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical _RARE_ of the latter . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ announce that `` the secret is the center of a philosophy '' and thereafter a hundred followers _RARE_ _RARE_ a higher _RARE_ . STO
* This is simply a confession of intellectual _RARE_ _RARE_ up to look _RARE_ . STO
* For as _RARE_ indicated ( 1953 ) , it is not the secret which is important , but the removal of _RARE_ . STO
* In this , philosophy and science share a common goal . STO
* The _RARE_ of the secret nonetheless guarantees that the division of _RARE_ and synthetic _RARE_ shall not be overcome by even the most _RARE_ argument ; ; for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between _RARE_ and science . STO
* The _RARE_ of metaphysical systems does not imply the _RARE_ of philosophy , only the close of a philosophic age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical . STO
* The _RARE_ with which present metaphysical attitudes _RARE_ private _RARE_ offers the strongest evidence that the _RARE_ between scientific and _RARE_ ways of _RARE_ is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science , religion and _RARE_ . STO
* ( cf. _RARE_ : 1958 . STO
* ) _RARE_ systems , and this includes even the relation of _RARE_ to _RARE_ physics , are built upon , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ systems , by the very nature of their _RARE_ , are _RARE_ by _RARE_ systems . STO
* In addition to the _RARE_ of science and the _RARE_ of metaphysics , they differ in that science is essentially descriptive , while philosophy in its inherited forms , tends to be _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ notion that belief , unlike _RARE_ , is not subject to objective analysis , has placed _RARE_ metaphysics _RARE_ against the sociology of knowledge , since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less _RARE_ than social _RARE_ . STO
* When dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge , or better the role of philosophy in _RARE_ research on the social sources of ideas , one has to become necessarily selective . STO
* Certain features we have touched upon : philosophy as a logical , _RARE_ system from which a social science _RARE_ can be built up ; ; philosophic analysis of the assumptions and _RARE_ of the social sciences ; ; and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of supposedly _RARE_ _RARE_ investigations . STO
* The objection will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted , namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms _RARE_ in the social sciences . STO
* _RARE_ , it will be asked whether the `` real '' questions people ask are not the `` ultimate '' questions that social science finds itself _RARE_ in the face of . STO
* What then is the status of such questions as : is society the ground of human existence or a means to an individual goal ? STO
* Do societies develop according to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals ? STO
* Does society really exist as an _RARE_ over and above the _RARE_ of men ? STO
* I think it must be said that , contrary to metaphysical insistence , these are questions so framed as to _RARE_ either empirical exploration or rational solutions . STO
* As _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) indicated , questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions , but _RARE_ of faith made to appear as _RARE_ questions . STO
* Such _RARE_ assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Social theory has no more right to expect results from meaningless questions , than physics has the right to expect a _RARE_ solution to the _RARE_ controversy . STO
* It is not that such questions are not asked . STO
* It is rather that _RARE_ them into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for certainty . STO
* An operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty , since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either replaces or _RARE_ . STO
* To raise the added objection that men require certainty on psychological grounds , answers to ultimate questions having an _RARE_ rather than scientific basis , is in a real sense to _RARE_ the objection itself . STO
* For what concerns all scientific _RARE_ is precisely that which can be captured for the rational , i.e. , for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and _RARE_ . STO
* A philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of men , an impatience with partial , tentative solutions . STO
* Men have always lived in a tentative world , and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary . STO
* _RARE_ overcoming itself is the _RARE_ of the quest for new and more precise information about the world . STO
* Without such uncertainty we are left with a set of _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The functional interplay of philosophy and science should , as a minimum , guarantee a meaningful _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* A degree of _RARE_ is a _RARE_ condition for the growth of science . STO
* But neither was the statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or _RARE_ that could be seen or heard . STO
* What were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ? STO
* To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to _RARE_ the theory _RARE_ , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery . STO
* It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . STO
* If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` _RARE_ '' or `` _RARE_ '' , then these _RARE_ judgments would cease from _RARE_ and weary heads could be at rest . STO
* This is the course the _RARE_ took . STO
* They explained value judgments by explaining them away . STO
* Now I do not think their view will do . STO
* But before discussing it , I should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case . STO
* It has been said of John Stuart _RARE_ that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out . STO
* This theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it _RARE_ criticism of the same kind , and this I will do my best to supply . STO
* The theory claims to show by analysis that when we say , `` That is good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking . STO
* I shall argue that we do mean to do just that . STO
* Let us work through an example , and the simpler and _RARE_ the better . STO
* There is perhaps no value statement on which people would more _RARE_ agree than the statement that intense pain is bad . STO
* Let us take a set of circumstances in which I happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which I think every one of us might naturally make such a statement . STO
* We come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the _RARE_ traps in common use . STO
* There are signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a _RARE_ of hunger , pain , and fear , it has all but eaten off its own leg . STO
* The attempt failed : the animal is now dead . STO
* As we think of the long and _RARE_ pain it must have suffered , we are very likely to say : `` It was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so '' . STO
* The positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion . STO
* I hold , on the contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain itself , namely , that it was bad -- bad when and as it occurred . STO
* Consider what follows from the positivist view . STO
* On that view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came on the scene and made my remark . STO
* For what I express in my remark is something going on in me at the time , and that of course did not exist until I did come on the scene . STO
* The pain of the rabbit was not itself bad ; ; nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured ; ; badness , in the only sense in which it is involved at all , waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt . STO
* Now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows . STO
* Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered . STO
* Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did ? STO
* Clearly not . STO
* Indeed , we should say , on the contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the _RARE_ pain , that it would have been every _RARE_ as bad whether a chance _RARE_ happened later to discover the body and feel _RARE_ or not . STO
* If so , then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only . STO
* We are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it . STO
* The first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference . STO
* It _RARE_ our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on positivist grounds it should be . STO
* The second argument applies the method in the reverse way . STO
* It _RARE_ _RARE_ the past event , and shows that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist grounds it should not . STO
* Let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all , but that we _RARE_ believe it did , and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing . STO
* On the positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second . STO
* In the only sense in which badness is involved at all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its _RARE_ , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there . STO
* And our question is , is such an implication consistent with what we meant ? STO
* Clearly it is not . STO
* If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference in the world , that what we were _RARE_ to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our _RARE_ was in that case mistaken . STO
* The suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake , because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seems to me merely frivolous . STO
* If we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred ? STO
* On the theory before us , such relief would be _RARE_ , for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all , and hence in its _RARE_ there would be nothing to be relieved about . STO
* The positivist theory would here _RARE_ our meaning beyond recognition . STO
* So far as I can see , there is only one way out for the positivist . STO
* He holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or _RARE_ . STO
* And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case _RARE_ our own feeling of _RARE_ without belonging to the pain itself . STO
* The pain in itself was neutral ; ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no grounds at all , took up toward this neutral object an attitude of _RARE_ and that made it for the first time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad . STO
* This way of escape is _RARE_ possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so far as I know , been urged by _RARE_ , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it . STO
* I come now to a third argument , which again is very simple . STO
* When we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; ; the _RARE_ are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling . STO
* But suppose that a week later we _RARE_ to the incident in thought and make our statement again . STO
* And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded . STO
* The _RARE_ evidence is no longer before us ; ; and we are now so _RARE_ in body and mind that feeling is , as we say , quite dead . STO
* In these circumstances , since what was expressed by the remark when first made is , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now _RARE_ nothing . STO
* It is as empty as the word `` _RARE_ '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it . STO
* And this seems to me _RARE_ . STO
* When we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing , the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the _RARE_ point , but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before , we should certainly answer Yes . STO
* We should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it was the same point we were making . STO
* And if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same , while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero , it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express . STO
* I come now to a fourth consideration . STO
* We all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not ; ; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense . STO
* _RARE_ and Ross have lately _RARE_ that this fitness is one of the main facts of _RARE_ , and I suspect they are right . STO
* But that is not exactly my point . STO
* My point is this : whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the _RARE_ say we do . STO
* Let me illustrate . STO
* In his novel The House Of The Dead , _RARE_ tells of his experiences in a _RARE_ prison camp . STO
* Whatever the unhappy _RARE_ of such camps are like today , _RARE_ _RARE_ were about as grim a lot as can be imagined . STO
* `` I have heard stories '' , he _RARE_ , `` of the most terrible , the most _RARE_ actions , of the most monstrous _RARE_ , told with the most spontaneous , _RARE_ _RARE_ laughter '' . STO
* Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very _RARE_ . STO
* If we were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly _RARE_ . STO
* Now on the _RARE_ view , this answer is ruled out . STO
* For before someone takes up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their _RARE_ , they have no moral quality at all . STO
* There is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or _RARE_ could be fitting . STO
* They are in themselves neutral , and , so far as they get a moral quality , they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the _RARE_ . STO
* But if that is true , why is any attitude more fitting than any other ? STO
* Would applause , for example , be fitting if , apart from the applause , there were nothing good to _RARE_ ? STO
* Would _RARE_ be fitting if , independently of the _RARE_ , there were nothing bad to _RARE_ ? STO
* In such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or _RARE_ as any other , which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point . STO
* Indeed , we are forced to go much farther . STO
* If goodness and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ laughter are taking the only sensible line . STO
* If there is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral _RARE_ only from our feeling about them , why shouldn't they be greeted with a _RARE_ ? STO
* To _RARE_ them with _RARE_ would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; ; it would _RARE_ bring badness into the world ; ; and even on _RARE_ assumptions that does not seem very bright . STO
* On the other hand , to _RARE_ them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good ; ; it would bring goodness into the world . STO
* The injured German veteran was a former _RARE_ , _RARE_ years old , who had been wounded by _RARE_ in the back of the head . STO
* This resulted in damage to the _RARE_ _RARE_ and very probably to the left side of the _RARE_ also . STO
* In any event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` _RARE_ blind '' , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact . STO
* _RARE_ blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual _RARE_ , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to _RARE_ up a _RARE_ of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . STO
* This circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is _RARE_ that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , _RARE_ ) awareness whatsoever . STO
* The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( ( 1 ) _RARE_ qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch , as such . STO
* We do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself . STO
* ( 2 ) _RARE_ becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representations ; ; that is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual space '' . STO
* The underlying assumption , of course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully _RARE_ way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other senses being _RARE_ _RARE_ , if not totally inadequate , in this regard . STO
* This is an assumption with which few would be _RARE_ to quarrel . STO
* Therefore , if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a _RARE_ person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems _RARE_ that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the _RARE_ of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary . STO
* The force of the _RARE_ analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered . STO
* ( 1 ) What allows us to think that the patient had no _RARE_ representations when his eyes were closed ? STO
* ( 2 ) What evidence is there that he was _RARE_ blind ? STO
* ( 3 ) How can we be sure that his sense of touch was not _RARE_ disturbed by his head injury ? STO
* We shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation . STO
* Obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question is _RARE_ , if the argument is to get under way at all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's tactual sensitivity had been _RARE_ by the _RARE_ _RARE_ , any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion . STO
* The answer the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance . STO
* It is as follows : `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of _RARE_ ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as well as the _RARE_ _RARE_ ( muscular feelings , feelings in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ ) , were , as such , essentially intact , although they seemed , in comparison with normal reactions , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body . STO
* The supposed tactual sense of spatial location and _RARE_ in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as well as the direction and scope of a movement , _RARE_ executed ( with one of his members ) , proved to have been , on the contrary , very considerably affected '' . STO
* The authors insist , however , that these _RARE_ in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic _RARE_ in that sense faculty but rather to the _RARE_ which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight . STO
* First of all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* ( 1 ) When an object was placed in the patient's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and so on . STO
* And he could recognize , by touch alone , articles which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him ; ; that is , he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was . STO
* ( 2 ) The patient _RARE_ an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . STO
* Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line of work , that of a _RARE_ , an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly _RARE_ sense of form and contour . STO
* It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly _RARE_ _RARE_ of the patient ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question , the one concerning the _RARE_ blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual _RARE_ and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . STO
* And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his _RARE_ life and in his work , even more than the foregoing facts ( mentioned above under 1 ) , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was _RARE_ ; ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the _RARE_ of the tactual apparatus , from the _RARE_ up to the tactual centers in the brain , -- that is , from one end to the other -- was _RARE_ '' . STO
* If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient's difficulties in _RARE_ himself _RARE_ and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his _RARE_ visual condition . STO
* But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand . STO
* In what ways , then , did the patient's _RARE_ blindness _RARE_ itself ? STO
* He could not see objects as unified , _RARE_ , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision . STO
* The meaning of this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund of visual _RARE_ of objects as objects ; ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even _RARE_ things upon seeing them again . STO
* Instead , he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and so on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours . STO
* According to his own testimony , he never actually saw things as _RARE_ but only as generally _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' of color of a more or less indefinite size ; ; at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether . STO
* But by the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously _RARE_ manner , find the _RARE_ form ; ; could piece , as it were , the _RARE_ mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a _RARE_ or whatever it turned out to be . STO
* If , however , the figure to be _RARE_ were complicated , composed of several _RARE_ _RARE_ , and so on , even the tracing process failed him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts . STO
* This meant , _RARE_ , that the patient could not read at all without making _RARE_ movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` _RARE_ marks '' inserted between _RARE_ words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it . STO
* The patient himself denied that he had any visual _RARE_ at all ; ; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to _RARE_ him . STO
* After a conversation with another man , he was able to _RARE_ practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like . STO
* Nor could he call up _RARE_ of close friends or relatives . STO
* In short , both his own _RARE_ and his _RARE_ blindness , when he looked at objects , seem to present _RARE_ evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all . STO
* He was _RARE_ of the form of the object actually being viewed , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learned and held in visual memory , as persons of normal vision do . STO
* He could not recognize it ; ; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at all . STO
* Therefore , his only _RARE_ was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object ; ; and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure . STO
* Then he might finally recognize it , apparently by _RARE_ the visual _RARE_ , actually being seen , with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements . STO
* This would mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience , the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual _RARE_ . STO
* As one would _RARE_ , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual _RARE_ and the _RARE_ beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference . STO
* Men , trees , automobiles , houses , and so on -- objects continually confronted in everyday life -- had each its characteristic _RARE_ and became easily _RARE_ , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as to what each was . STO
* _RARE_ , for example , he _RARE_ from black dots on a white surface . STO
* He evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects , but their size and the dots gave them away . STO
* And the authors give numerous instances of calculated _RARE_ on the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of _RARE_ himself and how _RARE_ he became at it . STO
* Often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly , without the tracing motions , solely on the basis of _RARE_ differences among the _RARE_ things which appeared in his visual experience . STO
* Perhaps the very important question -- What is , then , exactly the role of _RARE_ _RARE_ in the patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things ? STO
* -- has now been raised in the _RARE_ mind and in the following form . STO
* If the patient can perceive figure _RARE_ when he cannot perceive it _RARE_ , then , it would seem , the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations , at least in regard to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on the part of _RARE_ touch is denied by the authors . STO
* How , then , do the _RARE_ _RARE_ function in all this ? STO
* The authors set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability , _RARE_ , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned away from the object concerned ) . STO
* Quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by _RARE_ the patient from making any movements at all and then , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to . STO
* When the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all , the following striking results occurred . STO
* Whenever artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or _RARE_ three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) ; ; a _RARE_ , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . STO
* To speak of this underlying view of the world is to _RARE_ upon matters of subjective judgment . STO
* At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric _RARE_ and the _RARE_ line . STO
* Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . STO
* And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in _RARE_ that the outlook of their _RARE_ and users was basically stable and secure . STO
* The _RARE_ of the past had died away , and the great _RARE_ which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to _RARE_ men's minds . STO
* Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe _RARE_ _RARE_ itself . STO
* In the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or _RARE_ one in its internal _RARE_ , but the best of the Geometric _RARE_ have _RARE_ been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world . STO
* The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the _RARE_ _RARE_ and most _RARE_ between past and future '' , and the _RARE_ skill spent by its artists upon their products is a _RARE_ to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated . STO
* The Aegean in 800 B.C. Geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough , detailed study which it _RARE_ , partly because the task is a _RARE_ one and partly because some of its local manifestations , as at _RARE_ , are only now coming to light . STO
* From even a _RARE_ inspection of its many aspects , however , the _RARE_ can _RARE_ several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C. . STO
* The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the _RARE_ century was now _RARE_ to a significant degree . STO
* Much which was in _RARE_ in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . STO
* In this process the _RARE_ _RARE_ had been _RARE_ or finally rejected ; ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 . STO
* Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times -- granted occasional _RARE_ of peoples and ideas from outside -- are correct ; ; but all too many observers have been _RARE_ by this fact into _RARE_ the degree of change which took place in the early first _RARE_ . STO
* The focus of _RARE_ in this world now lay in the _RARE_ districts of the Greek _RARE_ , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always _RARE_ its northern _RARE_ , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery . STO
* While _RARE_ vases usually turn up , especially outside _RARE_ proper , together with as many or more examples of local _RARE_ , these `` _RARE_ '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century . STO
* In their place came local variations within the common style -- tentative , as it were , in _RARE_ products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed . STO
* _RARE_ , though important , was not the only teacher of this age . STO
* One can take a _RARE_ of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge of its place of origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; ; _RARE_ and _RARE_ of _RARE_ now become _RARE_ . STO
* The potters of the Aegean _RARE_ thus stood apart from those of the _RARE_ , and in _RARE_ itself _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and other Geometric _RARE_ have each their own _RARE_ . STO
* These local variations were to become ever _RARE_ in the next century and a half . STO
* The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the _RARE_ of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages . STO
* By 800 B.C. the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture . STO
* On these _RARE_ rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be _RARE_ in the remarkably _RARE_ _RARE_ of the Iliad . STO
* _RARE_ within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; ; Greek history and culture were _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , by the interplay of these _RARE_ yet opposed factors . STO
* Further we cannot go , for the Dark ages deserve their name . STO
* Many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently _RARE_ to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social _RARE_ of this world support a _RARE_ structure . STO
* The epic poems , the consolidation of the Greek _RARE_ , the rise of firm political units , the _RARE_ which could permit painted and _RARE_ representations of men -- all these had to await the progress of following decades . STO
* What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . STO
* These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ outlook , independent of outside forces . STO
* To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate _RARE_ born of our lack of detailed information ; ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong _RARE_ which came to an end within the period . STO
* The _RARE_ can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future _RARE_ will _RARE_ our understanding . STO
* Throughout the Dark ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently . STO
* The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood on firm ground . STO
* Chapter 5 the early eighth century the landscape of Greek history _RARE_ widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century B.C. , the age of _RARE_ `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* The first _RARE_ _RARE_ of the new day cannot yet _RARE_ all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world ; ; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more _RARE_ some of the lines of change . STO
* For this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; ; the _RARE_ material of the age is more _RARE_ , more _RARE_ , and more _RARE_ of the hopes and fears of its _RARE_ , who begin to show scenes of human life and death . STO
* _RARE_ and simple _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ of sculpture and _RARE_ in _RARE_ ; ; objects in gold , ivory , and _RARE_ grow more numerous . STO
* Since writing was _RARE_ in the Aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful . STO
* Though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken _RARE_ shape by _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ Geometric pottery of _RARE_ and the Iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent _RARE_ of Greek civilization ; ; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending . STO
* Greek civilization was _RARE_ toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the _RARE_ outlook were suddenly to break forth . STO
* The revolution was well under way before _RARE_ B.C. , and _RARE_ signs go back virtually across the century . STO
* The era , however , is _RARE_ . STO
* While many _RARE_ point forward , the main achievements stand as a _RARE_ of the simple patterns of the Dark ages . STO
* The dominant pottery of the century was Geometric ; ; political organization _RARE_ about the _RARE_ ; ; trade was just beginning to _RARE_ ; ; the gods who protected the Greek _RARE_ were only now putting on their sharply _RARE_ dress . STO
* The modern student , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century . STO
* Not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis . STO
* Many potters clung to the past the more _RARE_ as they were confronted with _RARE_ new ideas ; ; the poet of the Iliad deliberately _RARE_ . STO
* Although it is not possible to _RARE_ old and new in this era , I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an _RARE_ of the first stage of Greek civilization . STO
* On this principle of division I must _RARE_ the _RARE_ of sculpture , _RARE_ , society , and politics ; ; for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself . STO
* The growing contacts between Aegean and _RARE_ are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of _RARE_ culture after _RARE_ . STO
* We shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the East as we consider _RARE_ Geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious _RARE_ of early _RARE_ ; ; the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ models . STO
* The _RARE_ of _RARE_ vases and of the Iliad lie in the Aegean past . STO
* _RARE_ pottery the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called _RARE_ Geometric . STO
* The severe yet _RARE_ vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a _RARE_ of the principles underlying Geometric pottery ; ; but artists now were ready to _RARE_ and elaborate their _RARE_ . STO
* The vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style . STO
* Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines . STO
* In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in _RARE_ a fundamental sense of order after _RARE_ . STO
* They had had to work on very simple _RARE_ and had not dared to give _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* The potters , in particular , had virtually _RARE_ _RARE_ drawing , elaborate _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ lines of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe . STO
* In their vases were _RARE_ the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization , at first _RARE_ in _RARE_ work , and then more _RARE_ in the initial stages of the Geometric style . STO
* By 800 social and cultural security had been achieved , at least on a simple plane ; ; it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments . STO
* _RARE_ Geometric potters continued to _RARE_ the old _RARE_ of _RARE_ and shapes and made use of the _RARE_ though limited range of _RARE_ which they had inherited . STO
* In these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a _RARE_ of earlier lines of progress . STO
* To the _RARE_ lore , however , new materials were added . STO
* _RARE_ left less and less of a _RARE_ in a plain dark color ; ; instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by _RARE_ patterns into which _RARE_ drawing began to creep . STO
* _RARE_ lines , _RARE_ patterns , _RARE_ of indefinitely _RARE_ nature , birds either _RARE_ or in _RARE_ rows , animals in solemn frieze bands ( see _RARE_ 11 - 12 ) -- all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze . STO
* The rows of animals and birds , in particular , suggest awareness of _RARE_ animal _RARE_ , _RARE_ perhaps via _RARE_ silver _RARE_ and textiles , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek . STO
* Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the _RARE_ , which were among the leading _RARE_ of pottery throughout the century . STO
* As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident . STO
* _RARE_ 12 illustrates four examples , which are _RARE_ or _RARE_ Geometric work of common spirit but of different schools . STO
* Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , _RARE_ him . STO
* _RARE_ the evidence _RARE_ to get a conviction , he later released him . STO
* Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and _RARE_ that he would kill the Indian . STO
* Three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a _RARE_ issued by the Catskill justice on _RARE_ prepared by the district attorney , Cook and _RARE_ rode to arrest _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ at _RARE_ , they found _RARE_ in his _RARE_ and demanded that he surrender . STO
* Instead , he _RARE_ and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . STO
* Both _RARE_ and Russell's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . STO
* General manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished . STO
* On February 17 , _RARE_ and Cook were sent to the _RARE_ _RARE_ community on the Vermejo to see about _RARE_ out _RARE_ the company had purchased . STO
* While talking with _RARE_ M. _RARE_ , Francisco _RARE_ and Juan _RARE_ appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away . STO
* It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with _RARE_ and began riding down the stream . STO
* They had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a _RARE_ across the stream just ahead of them . STO
* _RARE_ an ambush , the two _RARE_ decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into Catskill . STO
* After spending two nights ( Wednesday and Thursday ) in Catskill , the _RARE_ again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business . STO
* They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old _RARE_ Lee ranch . STO
* Half a mile below at the mouth of _RARE_ _RARE_ was an old ranch that the company had purchased from A. J. _RARE_ , occupied by a Mexican , his wife , and an old _RARE_ . STO
* There were three houses in _RARE_ _RARE_ just at the foot of a low bluff , the road winding along the top , entering above , and then passing down in front of the houses , _RARE_ to the Vermejo . STO
* To the west of this road was another low bluff , forty or fifty feet high , covered with scrub oak and other brush . STO
* As they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two _RARE_ , a _RARE_ of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers . STO
* Not a bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush , but one hit _RARE_ in the leg and another broke his arm , passing on through his body . STO
* With the first reports , Russell's horse _RARE_ to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook , followed by a _RARE_ of bullets , raced towards the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ immediately in front of him , just reaching it as his horse fell . STO
* _RARE_ his Winchester from its _RARE_ , Cook prepared to fight from behind the _RARE_ bank . STO
* _RARE_ were so thick , throwing sand in his face , that he found it difficult to return the fire . STO
* _RARE_ Russell's horse in front of the long log building , he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight , so he began working his way down the ditch to join him . STO
* At a very shallow place , two Mexicans rushed into the open for a shot . STO
* _RARE_ to one knee , Cook _RARE_ one , and the other struggled off with his _RARE_ , sending no further fire in his direction . STO
* Just before leaving the _RARE_ where he was partially concealed , he did hear shots down at the house . STO
* _RARE_ had reached the house as Cook _RARE_ , dismounted , but just as the old _RARE_ opened the door to receive him , he fell into the _RARE_ arms -- dead . STO
* A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed through his head , tearing a hole _RARE_ square on the _RARE_ side . STO
* _RARE_ him dead , Cook caught Russell's horse and rode to the cattle _RARE_ house to report the incident and request _RARE_ to trail the _RARE_ . STO
* Before daylight Sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of _RARE_ _RARE_ Frank _RARE_ of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco _RARE_ , where 100 to _RARE_ Mexicans had gathered . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ approached the _RARE_ _RARE_ house and demanded entrance . STO
* The men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid . STO
* The officer demanded the names of the injured men ; ; the Mexicans not only refused to give them , but told the _RARE_ if they wanted a fight they could have it . STO
* Since the strength of the Mexicans had been _RARE_ , too small a posse had been collected , and since the deputy had not been provided with search _RARE_ , _RARE_ and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw . STO
* The _RARE_ retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* During the following week , six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned ; ; some buildings , farm tools , two horses , _RARE_ , and hay owned by _RARE_ _RARE_ , a friendly _RARE_ for the company , and _RARE_ _RARE_ hay were stolen or destroyed ; ; and a store was broken into and robbed . STO
* District Attorney M. W. Mills warned that he would vigorously _RARE_ persons caught _RARE_ these crimes or carrying arms -- he just didn't catch anyone . STO
* _RARE_ threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New Mexico . STO
* His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by _RARE_ or he would be compelled to kill them in _RARE_ , _RARE_ the troubles . STO
* By early summer , he wrote from _RARE_ that he was suffering from the wound _RARE_ in the ambush and was in a bad way _RARE_ , so Pels sent him a draft for _RARE_ , warning that it was still not wise for him to return . STO
* Pels also sent a check for _RARE_ to Russell's widow and had a white marble monument _RARE_ on his grave . STO
* _RARE_ stealing and killing , again serious during the spring of _RARE_ , placed the land grant company officers in a _RARE_ position . STO
* They were reluctant to _RARE_ _RARE_ to protect the property , thus running the risk of creating _RARE_ such as that on the Vermejo , and yet the _RARE_ protested that they got no salary for _RARE_ cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot . STO
* And the law virtually ignored the situation . STO
* The judge became ill just as the _RARE_ District Court _RARE_ , no substitute was brought in , no criminal cases heard , only 5 out of _RARE_ cases _RARE_ were tried , and court _RARE_ _RARE_ die after sitting a few days instead of the usual three weeks . STO
* Pels complained : `` _RARE_ and witnesses were put to the expense and _RARE_ of going long distances to _RARE_ business ; ; public money spent ; ; justice delayed ; ; nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ reached the company that the man behind these _RARE_ was Manuel Gonzales , a man with many followers , including a number who were kept in line through fear of him . STO
* Although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named _RARE_ Jones , the warrant for his arrest had never been served . STO
* On May 19 , a deputy _RARE_ posse of eight men left _RARE_ City and rode _RARE_ miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* By _RARE_ A.M. they reached his house and found it vacant . STO
* When they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby , they smashed down the door , broke the window , and threw lighted clothes wet with _RARE_ into the room . STO
* Still there was no Gonzales and the family would say nothing . STO
* About 300 yards up the creek was a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square . STO
* While _RARE_ around these buildings , two of the posse recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside . STO
* He was promised that no harm would _RARE_ him if he would come out , but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door . STO
* The posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive . STO
* Again he refused . STO
* In deadly earnest , the _RARE_ methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted _RARE_ inside , only to have most _RARE_ out by the women as soon as they hit the floor . STO
* When it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer , taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside , square against the muzzle of a Winchester . STO
* _RARE_ near the heart , he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away , three bullets following him . STO
* As he pushed open the door he fell on his face , one of his comrades pulling him inside . STO
* Not _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the wound , the _RARE_ warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him . STO
* _RARE_ no answer , they set the fire . STO
* When the house was about half _RARE_ , his _RARE_ ran to the door and threw up his hands , _RARE_ repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of Manuel . STO
* _RARE_ it true that he was not inside , the _RARE_ returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket . STO
* Several _RARE_ fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently _RARE_ hand . STO
* _RARE_ six or eight times the body was draped with Russell's pistol , belt , and _RARE_ . STO
* There was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who , though _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack . STO
* Early the next morning , a Mexican telephoned Pels that _RARE_ _RARE_ , one of the posse members , was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father's home on the upper Vermejo . STO
* The sheriff and District Attorney Mills hastily swore out a number of _RARE_ against men who had been riding about armed , according to signed statements by _RARE_ and Dr. I. P. George , and ordered _RARE_ Barney Clark of _RARE_ to rescue the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ all night , Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock May 22 . STO
* Occasionally they heard _RARE_ signals and a number of _RARE_ were _RARE_ on the hills , _RARE_ at the _RARE_ approach . STO
* A Mexican justice of the peace had issue a _RARE_ against _RARE_ for taking part in the `` murder '' of Manuel Gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger . STO
* The men helped them gather their _RARE_ and _RARE_ them to _RARE_ along with three other families _RARE_ to leave . STO
* The ten or more dangerous parties _RARE_ out for _RARE_ were still at large , and Pels realized that if these men _RARE_ themselves in their _RARE_ houses , defending themselves through _RARE_ , it would be most difficult to _RARE_ them . STO
* Thus he wired J. P. _RARE_ and Sons of _RARE_ : `` Have you any _RARE_ hand _RARE_ for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or _RARE_ shot ? STO
* If not , how long to order and what is the price '' ? STO
* He _RARE_ decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming _RARE_ , particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard . STO
* His problem then became one of restraining the American _RARE_ who wanted to clean out the Vermejo by force immediately . STO
* The plant was located west of the _RARE_ and south of the location of the former electric light plant . STO
* The Manchester Depot _RARE_ Company issued _RARE_ shares of stock at _RARE_ each for construction of a _RARE_ in that _RARE_ , and _RARE_ were made for its maintenance . STO
* It has given considerable trouble at times and _RARE_ right into the _RARE_ . STO
* Fire District No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an _RARE_ investment . STO
* The _RARE_ on _RARE_ Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street . STO
* As new homes were built they were connected so that all _RARE_ south of School Street are served by it . STO
* B. J. _RARE_ is the present treasurer and manager . STO
* The 1946 town meeting voted to have the _RARE_ _RARE_ a committee to investigate and report on the _RARE_ of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center , Depot , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The committee submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and _RARE_ Wiley with a _RARE_ published in the 1946 town report . STO
* The _RARE_ of the _RARE_ lines was designed by Henry W. Taylor , who was the engineer for the Manchester Village disposal plant . STO
* No figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town . STO
* The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities . STO
* The final step was a vote for a _RARE_ bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by the 1959 town meeting , later confirmed by a _RARE_ vote at a special town meeting June 21 , 1960 . STO
* There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the _RARE_ of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams . STO
* Telephone and telegraph _RARE_ unusual interest in _RARE_ has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev. J. D. _RARE_ , _RARE_ of _RARE_ and Burton _RARE_ , was a personal friend and _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , Samuel F. B. _RARE_ . STO
* At any rate , Manchester did not _RARE_ far behind the first commercial system which was set up in _RARE_ between Baltimore and Washington . STO
* In _RARE_ _RARE_ B. _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , became the town's first _RARE_ in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the _RARE_ House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' . STO
* _RARE_ was _RARE_ for the `` American Telegraph Company '' and the `` _RARE_ and Canada _RARE_ Telegraph Company '' . STO
* _RARE_ of capital stock at _RARE_ each in the latter company were _RARE_ at the Bank of Manchester or at various other Vermont banks . STO
* A message of less than fifteen words to _RARE_ cost twenty-five cents . STO
* By _RARE_ L. C. Orvis , manager of the `` Western Union Telegraph Company '' , expressed _RARE_ to send emergency _RARE_ on _RARE_ from his Village drugstore . STO
* Orvis even needed to hire an assistant , Clark J. Wait . STO
* The Manchester Journal commented _RARE_ on the surprising amount of local _RARE_ business . STO
* In the fall of _RARE_ , the `` _RARE_ Telegraph Line '' was established between Manchester and Factory Point by the owners , Paul W. Orvis , Henry Gray , J. N. _RARE_ , and Clark J. Wait . STO
* The line soon lived up to its name , as local _RARE_ of moderate length could be sent for a _RARE_ and the company was quickly able to _RARE_ very liberal dividends on its capital stock . STO
* In _RARE_ the same Clark Wait , with H. H. _RARE_ of South Dorset , formed the `` American Telegraph Line '' , extending from Manchester Depot via Factory Point and South Dorset to Dorset . STO
* Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners '' . STO
* _RARE_ at the Depot at this time were _RARE_ C. _RARE_ and Mark _RARE_ of `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ in lumber and dry goods . STO
* Early equipment was very _RARE_ ; ; the smallest _RARE_ of wind _RARE_ _RARE_ , making communications impossible . STO
* But companies continued to spring up . STO
* By _RARE_ the `` _RARE_ Telegraph Company '' was in existence and _RARE_ _RARE_ was its president . STO
* _RARE_ in _RARE_ was the `` Valley Telegraph Line '' , officers of which were E. C. Orvis , president ; ; H. _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and secretary ; ; J. N. _RARE_ , treasurer ; ; F. H. Walker , _RARE_ ; ; H. S. Walker , assistant _RARE_ . STO
* Two companies now had headquarters with Clark J. Wait , who by then had his own drugstore at Factory Point -- the `` Northern Union Telegraph Company '' and the `` Western Union '' . STO
* _RARE_ were Arthur _RARE_ and _RARE_ Taylor . STO
* Still existing on a `` Northern Union '' telegraph form is a typical _RARE_ message from _RARE_ _RARE_ J. J. _RARE_ to Burton and _RARE_ store in Manchester -- `` Get and send by stage four pounds best _RARE_ or _RARE_ stake , for Mrs. _RARE_ send six sweet _RARE_ '' . STO
* About _RARE_ J. E. _RARE_ of _RARE_ and E. G. _RARE_ became _RARE_ of the `` Green _RARE_ Telegraph Company '' , _RARE_ all offices on the Western Union line and extending over the mountain from _RARE_ to _RARE_ , _RARE_ , South _RARE_ , _RARE_ Lake , _RARE_ , North _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ River , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* From _RARE_ until 1910 John H. Whipple was manager of Western Union at the Center in the drugstore he purchased from Clark Wait . STO
* The Village office of Western Union with George _RARE_ as manager and _RARE_ continued in _RARE_ drugstore until _RARE_ . STO
* During the summers , _RARE_ often needed the assistance of a company operator . STO
* These were the years when people _RARE_ to Manchester not only to play golf , which had come into _RARE_ , but also to witness the _RARE_ _RARE_ Club _RARE_ . STO
* New _RARE_ were kept informed of scores by reporters who _RARE_ fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers . STO
* This _RARE_ local telegraph business and Manchester _RARE_ in all the free advertising . STO
* In _RARE_ when the town was chosen for the U. S. _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , a representative hurried here from the Boston _RARE_ office . STO
* In his wake came the District _RARE_ _RARE_ and the cream of the _RARE_ profession , ten of _RARE_ best , chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf . STO
* During that _RARE_ alone , some _RARE_ words _RARE_ their way out of Manchester . STO
* The old _RARE_ system was replaced _RARE_ by the _RARE_ modern automatic method in _RARE_ , when _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) was manager of the Western Union office . STO
* During summers , business was so _RARE_ that Mrs. _RARE_ had two _RARE_ and a _RARE_ . STO
* She was succeeded by _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Since that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad station at the Depot and shops at the Center back to the town clerk's office and drugstore at the Village . STO
* After being located for some years in the Village at the _RARE_ _RARE_ under the supervision of Mrs. Harry _RARE_ , it is presently located in the Hill and _RARE_ _RARE_ , Manchester Center . STO
* The first known telephone line in Manchester was established in July _RARE_ between _RARE_ and _RARE_ store at Manchester Depot and the Kent and _RARE_ _RARE_ Company in South Dorset . STO
* This was extended the following year to include the railroad station _RARE_ office and _RARE_ Hotel at Factory Point . STO
* In November _RARE_ a line _RARE_ several dwelling houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester Depot . STO
* Telephone wires from Louis _RARE_ house in East Manchester to the _RARE_ lumber job near _RARE_ _RARE_ were up about 1895 . STO
* _RARE_ L. Taylor of Manchester Depot recorded the setting of phone _RARE_ in East Dorset and _RARE_ in his _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* These must have been for local calls strictly , as in May 1900 the `` only long distance telephone '' in town was transferred from C. B. _RARE_ to _RARE_ shoe store . STO
* A small single _RARE_ was installed in the Village over _RARE_ _RARE_ store ( later E. H. _RARE_ ) . STO
* George _RARE_ was manager and _RARE_ ; ; Elizabeth _RARE_ was the first operator ; ; and a night operator was also employed . STO
* _RARE_ fortunate enough to have one of those early _RARE_ advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the Manchester Journal . STO
* In _RARE_ the New England Telephone Company began _RARE_ a building to house its operations on the corner of U. S. _RARE_ 7 and what is now _RARE_ Avenue at Manchester Center . STO
* Service running through _RARE_ and to _RARE_ County towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the `` _RARE_ Telephone Company '' in _RARE_ , but major supervision of telephone lines in Manchester was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company , which eventually gained all control . STO
* More _RARE_ and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business . STO
* In 1931 Mrs. F. H. _RARE_ , agent and chief operator , who was to _RARE_ in 1946 with thirty _RARE_ service , led agency offices in sales for the year with _RARE_ . STO
* William _RARE_ , who retired in _RARE_ , was a veteran of _RARE_ _RARE_ local service . STO
* Another veteran telephone operator was _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , who had been in the office forty years at the time of her death in 1960 . STO
* In _RARE_ Dorset received its own exchange , which made business easier for the Manchester office , but it was not until February 1953 that area service was extended to include Manchester and Dorset . STO
* This eliminated _RARE_ calls between the two towns . STO
* Within a month , calls were up _RARE_ per cent . STO
* _RARE_ power electricity plays such an important part in community life today that it is difficult to _RARE_ a time when current was not available for daily use . STO
* Yet one has to go back only some sixty years . STO
* The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ on the West _RARE_ in Factory Point . STO
* No records are available as to the date or extent of _RARE_ , but it may have been in _RARE_ . STO
* On June 14 , 1900 the Manchester Journal reported that an electrical engineer was _RARE_ an electric light plant for Edward S. _RARE_ at `` _RARE_ Hill '' . STO
* This was working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service . STO
* In November 1900 surveying was done under John Marsden on the east mountains to _RARE_ if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power plant . STO
* Nothing came of it , perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage . STO
* The next step was construction by the Manchester Light and Power Company of a plant on the west bank of the _RARE_ south of Union Street bridge . STO
* This was nearly completed May 23 , _RARE_ with a promise of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go on until September 28 . STO
* It was at the end of the sidewalk in front of the _RARE_ _RARE_ cottage . STO
* The first directors of the Manchester Light and Power Company were John Marsden , M. L. _RARE_ , William F. Orvis , George Smith , and John _RARE_ . STO
* The officers were John Marsden , president ; ; John C. _RARE_ , _RARE_ ; ; George Smith , treasurer ; ; and William F. Orvis , secretary . STO
* Marsden was manager of the company for ten years and manager of its successor company , the _RARE_ Light and Power Company , for one year . STO
* At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under way , the _RARE_ Light and _RARE_ Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ to use its surplus power for generating electricity . STO
* Manchester then had two competing power companies until _RARE_ , when the Manchester Light and Power Company purchased the transmission system of the _RARE_ Company . STO
* This was fortunate , as the _RARE_ plant burned in _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ Light and Power Company was succeeded by the Vermont _RARE_ Corporation , which in turn was absorbed by the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation . STO
* The latter now _RARE_ the area with electricity distributed from a modern _RARE_ at Manchester Depot which was put into operation February 19 , _RARE_ and was improved in January 1942 by the _RARE_ of larger _RARE_ . STO
* For a time following the _RARE_ of the local plant , electric current for Manchester was brought in from the south with an emergency _RARE_ with the Vermont _RARE_ Company system to the north . STO
* Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned _RARE_ of a learned world '' , `` a _RARE_ with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous _RARE_ of intellectual high spirits , a _RARE_ of debate , _RARE_ , comedy and invention '' . STO
* With respect to this view , two points are worth making . STO
* First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` _RARE_ '' , `` gay '' . STO
* It _RARE_ the other fact that it is described as `` _RARE_ minus _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , `` no less _RARE_ than gay '' . STO
* It also _RARE_ the fact that in a rational _RARE_ , and quite clearly in More's _RARE_ , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn . STO
* More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . STO
* That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , _RARE_ _RARE_ by all too many _RARE_ who _RARE_ believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that _RARE_ _RARE_ which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . STO
* _RARE_ , to find a learned _RARE_ and a _RARE_ joke in More's account of the stupid _RARE_ of early _RARE_ century wars , of the _RARE_ of the poor and _RARE_ , of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the rich and powerful requires a _RARE_ toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral _RARE_ and most surprising in More himself . STO
* Indeed , it is even surprising in the _RARE_ of Christ Church and _RARE_ Professor of _RARE_ _RARE_ , who _RARE_ this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of _RARE_ and Renaissance English at _RARE_ , who inherited it and is now its most _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But to return to the main line of our inquiry , it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . STO
* Utopia is still widely read because in a sense More stood on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* And if he did stand on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as _RARE_ _RARE_ might be able to force on Western _RARE_ . STO
* It was not even in writing Latin _RARE_ , sometimes _RARE_ ones , or in _RARE_ _RARE_ from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative _RARE_ , or in _RARE_ the conservative _RARE_ who opposed _RARE_ _RARE_ study of the New _RARE_ . STO
* Similar literary exercises were the common _RARE_ of a Christian _RARE_ of the first two decades of the _RARE_ century . STO
* Had More's _RARE_ been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time , whose works _RARE_ survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works . STO
* More stands on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ for one reason alone -- because he wrote Utopia . STO
* And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there _RARE_ quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so . STO
* Only one other contemporary of More's _RARE_ so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work -- _RARE_ _RARE_ and The _RARE_ . STO
* Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has _RARE_ this response ? STO
* Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same _RARE_ scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern . STO
* The medieval was the most important to _RARE_ because he sought to place Thomas More , the author of Utopia , in some intelligible relation with St. Thomas More , the martyr . STO
* To others whose concern it is to _RARE_ the significance of Christian _RARE_ , the Renaissance elements are of primary concern . STO
* But here we have a distinctly modern _RARE_ ; ; we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has ; ; we want to know what is _RARE_ new about Utopia . STO
* What is new about it ? STO
* To that question the answer is simple ; ; it can be made in two words , Utopian communism . STO
* But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an _RARE_ of objections and _RARE_ . STO
* Surely there is nothing new about communism . STO
* We find it in _RARE_ Republic , and in Utopia More _RARE_ his _RARE_ to that book . STO
* We find it in that `` common way of life _RARE_ to Christ and still in use among the _RARE_ societies of _RARE_ '' , that is , the better _RARE_ which made it easier to convert the _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* We find it in the later _RARE_ conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all possessions . STO
* This conception was taken up by the early Church _RARE_ and by _RARE_ lawyers and _RARE_ in the _RARE_ Ages ; ; and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it . STO
* But although the idea of communism is very old even in More's day and did not spring _RARE_ from his imagination in _RARE_ , it is not communism as such that we are concerned with . STO
* We are concerned not with the _RARE_ communism nor with other species of the _RARE_ : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , early Christian , monastic , _RARE_ or _RARE_ communism ; ; we are concerned with Utopian communism -- that is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary _RARE_ of Utopia , as More conceived it . STO
* Perhaps one way to _RARE_ our sense of the _RARE_ of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of _RARE_ theory . STO
* We will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by _RARE_ what it is not . STO
* In _RARE_ Republic communism is -- to speak _RARE_ -- a communism of _RARE_ . STO
* Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevails , the governing warrior elite . STO
* Moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ into the construction of an imaginary _RARE_ with its _RARE_ communism of goods , _RARE_ , and children , was his quest for a _RARE_ for the proper ordering of the individual human _RARE_ ; ; and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns . STO
* In More's Utopia communism is not a means of _RARE_ out a warrior elite from the _RARE_ mass . STO
* Utopian communism applies to all _RARE_ . STO
* And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central . STO
* The concern of Utopia is with the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the best ordering of a civil society ; ; and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism provides the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to that best ordering . STO
* To derive Utopian communism from the _RARE_ Christian community of the _RARE_ age or from its medieval _RARE_ , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of _RARE_ , _RARE_ in the same way as to derive it from _RARE_ Republic : in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual _RARE_ , in the _RARE_ and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself . STO
* And the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a _RARE_ which would test their religious _RARE_ for monastic _RARE_ , their spiritual _RARE_ . STO
* Finally , the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the _RARE_ was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time , although it was not accepted by all the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Ages . STO
* In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the _RARE_ of Man . STO
* It did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had _RARE_ . STO
* The actual function of _RARE_ communism was adequately set forth by St. _RARE_ almost a _RARE_ before More wrote Utopia . STO
* `` The soil is common to all men . STO
* When we give the _RARE_ of life to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs . STO
* We should think of it more as an act of justice than _RARE_ '' . STO
* Because community not _RARE_ of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely _RARE_ right to what is his . STO
* Indeed , of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience _RARE_ to regard himself as a _RARE_ . STO
* He is a trustee for the common good , however feeble the _RARE_ which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his _RARE_ of that share of the common fund , _RARE_ or _RARE_ , _RARE_ to his keeping . STO
* In contrast to this _RARE_ view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the _RARE_ of municipal law is to _RARE_ on the _RARE_ sea of human _RARE_ in a _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ brace conscience with legal sanctions . STO
* In a properly ordered society the massive force of public law _RARE_ the function which in natural law theory _RARE_ is left altogether to a small voice so often still . STO
* In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism _RARE_ from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role . STO
* Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced . STO
* We do not deny originality to the _RARE_ because _RARE_ found the _RARE_ of the house of _RARE_ among the folk lore of the _RARE_ . STO
* In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original -- a new thing . STO
* It is not merely a new thing ; ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; ; most of the rest is medieval or _RARE_ or part of an old tradition of social criticism . STO
* But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin _RARE_ _RARE_ a new perception of the nature of the _RARE_ encounter with man . STO
* New , indeed , is _RARE_ perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what _RARE_ was getting at . STO
* Although Utopian communism is both new in _RARE_ and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern _RARE_ , as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice . STO
* Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the _RARE_ ; ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including _RARE_ , meals taken publicly in common _RARE_ ; ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; ; even houses changed once a decade ; ; six hours of manual labor a day for all but a _RARE_ of _RARE_ and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from _RARE_ ; ; no private property , no money ; ; no sort of _RARE_ at all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term . STO
* Whatever the _RARE_ of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that _RARE_ those details . STO
* What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the _RARE_ tradition with the _RARE_ continuous history , the one which reached _RARE_ by the way of _RARE_ through the Church _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* During the _RARE_ trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and _RARE_ _RARE_ as a martyr to the principles of the _RARE_ of Independence . STO
* During the Brown trial , however , the _RARE_ most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his _RARE_ , with the assistance of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , had plotted not only the _RARE_ of the slaves but also the _RARE_ of state and federal governments . STO
* The Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the _RARE_ of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican _RARE_ , who proclaim as one of their _RARE_ principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' . STO
* The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of _RARE_ the facts and attempting to _RARE_ history . STO
* While the Daily Post continued to accuse _RARE_ and the Daily Journal continued to accuse _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ complained that the Virginia authorities showed _RARE_ and _RARE_ haste to _RARE_ Brown and his men . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' . STO
* The Providence Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be _RARE_ feelings . STO
* The Providence Daily Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . STO
* On October 31 , 1859 , John Brown was found guilty of _RARE_ against the state of Virginia , _RARE_ slave _RARE_ , and murder . STO
* For these crimes he was _RARE_ to be _RARE_ in public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . STO
* Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . STO
* Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John Brown's trial with extreme interest . STO
* On Wednesday morning , November 2 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown _RARE_ deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fair trial . STO
* The _RARE_ main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted . STO
* The readers of the Providence Daily Post , however , learned that it was generally _RARE_ that `` Old Brown '' had a fair trial . STO
* _RARE_ the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have _RARE_ her laws , organized _RARE_ , and _RARE_ her citizens '' . STO
* In the eastern section of the state the _RARE_ reaction to Brown's trial and sentence were basically identical . STO
* J. _RARE_ Smith , editor of the Warren Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in order that all those _RARE_ _RARE_ , who , _RARE_ by a blind _RARE_ , dare to _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and murder , may _RARE_ it and shape their future course accordingly '' . STO
* The editor of the Newport _RARE_ could discover no evidence of _RARE_ circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the _RARE_ of capital punishment . STO
* In direct contrast to the other Rhode Island editors , Samuel S. _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ condemned the trial as being completely unfair . STO
* _RARE_ the sentence , _RARE_ wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall _RARE_ _RARE_ and that John Brown's sentence shall be _RARE_ to _RARE_ , it would be well -- well for the country and for Virginia '' . STO
* Despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John Brown , Rhode Islanders turned their attention to the state elections . STO
* The state had elected Republican candidates in the past two years . STO
* There was no doubt as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the state . STO
* If it failed on occasion to _RARE_ its candidates for general state offices by _RARE_ , the failure was due to a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ party , which called itself the American Republican party . STO
* The American _RARE_ and the _RARE_ both _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ for governor . STO
* _RARE_ R. _RARE_ was the Democratic candidate . STO
* The results of the election of 1859 found Republican candidates not only _RARE_ the offices of governor and _RARE_ but also obtaining the two _RARE_ offices from the eastern and western sections of the state . STO
* During the month of November hardly a day passed when there was not some mention of John Brown in the Rhode Island newspapers . STO
* On November 7 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal _RARE_ a letter sent to John Brown from `` E. B. '' , a _RARE_ lady in Newport . STO
* In reference to Brown's _RARE_ she wrote , `` though we are _RARE_ and _RARE_ believe it better to reform by moral and not by _RARE_ weapons , we know _RARE_ was _RARE_ by the most generous and _RARE_ motives '' . STO
* `` E. B. '' compared John Brown to _RARE_ in that they were both acting to deliver millions from _RARE_ . STO
* In contrast to `` E. B. '' , most Rhode Islanders hardly thought of John Brown as being another _RARE_ . STO
* Most attempts to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an _RARE_ audience in Rhode Island . STO
* On Wednesday evening , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , Rev. Mark _RARE_ of New _RARE_ , gave a `` Mission of _RARE_ '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the _RARE_ Ferry _RARE_ . STO
* The Warren Telegraph stated that many of Rev. _RARE_ remarks were _RARE_ and _RARE_ strongly of _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* In its account of the _RARE_ lecture , the Providence Daily Post said that the remarks of Rev. _RARE_ made the people _RARE_ . STO
* No sympathy or _RARE_ for Brown could be found in the Providence Daily Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more _RARE_ of sympathy . STO
* The Providence Daily Journal , however , stated that Brown's courage , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one '' . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or _RARE_ `` but he should no more be hung than Henry A. _RARE_ or James _RARE_ '' . STO
* The Newport _RARE_ _RARE_ more concern over the possibility of the _RARE_ making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him . STO
* In her letter to John Brown , `` E. B. '' , the _RARE_ from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington . STO
* During the latter days of November to the day of Brown's execution , it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not _RARE_ in `` E. _RARE_ '' suggestion . STO
* On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown's `` _RARE_ '' and honest _RARE_ must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only _RARE_ other _RARE_ to _RARE_ his actions . STO
* A week later the Daily Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting _RARE_ John Brown on the day of his execution . STO
* The editor of the Daily Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for Providence '' . STO
* The Providence Daily _RARE_ editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting _RARE_ Brown was to be held in Providence . STO
* He further called upon the people of Providence to _RARE_ the meeting and avoid _RARE_ . STO
* On December 2 , 1859 , John Brown was _RARE_ at Charles _RARE_ , Virginia . STO
* _RARE_ precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within the _RARE_ surrounding the _RARE_ . STO
* In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were _RARE_ . STO
* Such was not the case in Rhode Island . STO
* The only public demonstration in honor of John Brown was held at _RARE_ Hall in Providence , on the day of his execution . STO
* Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the _RARE_ Hall meeting `` brought together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the _RARE_ of such a gathering '' . STO
* _RARE_ on the platform were _RARE_ C. _RARE_ , _RARE_ of Providence and a _RARE_ Republican stove manufacturer ; ; Thomas Davis , an _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; the Reverend _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ minister ; ; the Reverend George T. Day , a _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ W. _RARE_ , and William H. H. _RARE_ . STO
* The latter two were appointed _RARE_ . STO
* The first speaker was _RARE_ C. _RARE_ who had been _RARE_ chosen president of the meeting . STO
* He spoke of his desire to promote the _RARE_ of slavery by _RARE_ means and he compared John Brown of _RARE_ Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode Island's colonial period . STO
* _RARE_ concluded that as Rhode Island's John Brown became a _RARE_ hero , if not a saint , so would it be with John Brown of _RARE_ Ferry . STO
* The next speaker was George T. Day . STO
* Although _RARE_ Brown's guilt on legal grounds , Day said that , `` Brown is no common criminal ; ; his _RARE_ was not below , but above the law '' . STO
* Following Day was _RARE_ who spoke of his _RARE_ of Brown's attempt at _RARE_ _RARE_ , his _RARE_ of Brown's character , and his opposition to slavery . STO
* _RARE_ remarks were _RARE_ by a portion of the audience several times and once there was _RARE_ . STO
* The fourth and last speaker was Thomas Davis . STO
* By this time large numbers of the audience had left the hall . STO
* Davis _RARE_ his remarks by an _RARE_ to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city . STO
* He said that the _RARE_ or _RARE_ of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments . STO
* In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his _RARE_ for Brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they `` are _RARE_ to the charge that they are supporting _RARE_ and _RARE_ men whom the laws have condemned '' . STO
* He recalled that in Rhode Island a party opposed to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of a man ( Thomas W. _RARE_ ) proclaimed the _RARE_ action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty . STO
* At the close of _RARE_ speech the following _RARE_ and _RARE_ were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed _RARE_ : Whereas , John Brown has _RARE_ _RARE_ his life in _RARE_ to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day _RARE_ to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no _RARE_ : Therefore , _RARE_ that , while we most _RARE_ _RARE_ the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his _RARE_ to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor . STO
* _RARE_ that his _RARE_ and _RARE_ in _RARE_ , _RARE_ by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call for a _RARE_ judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to _RARE_ the _RARE_ from which he had suffered , and _RARE_ his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and _RARE_ justice . STO
* _RARE_ that the _RARE_ sentiment is becoming ripe for _RARE_ action . STO
* _RARE_ , that we find in this _RARE_ _RARE_ at _RARE_ Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as _RARE_ as possible . STO
* On the morning following the _RARE_ Hall meeting the editor of the Providence Daily Journal wrote that although the meeting was _RARE_ and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely . STO
* Rather than being _RARE_ , the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . STO
* Through _RARE_ and 1912 , as the Cubist _RARE_ tendency to _RARE_ to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at _RARE_ length fell all the more to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* To _RARE_ , and sometimes to replace , the simulated _RARE_ , Braque and Picasso began to _RARE_ sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the _RARE_ texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . STO
* In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact _RARE_ of wood _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be _RARE_ -- and set to _RARE_ again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the _RARE_ except near the surface . STO
* The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of _RARE_ , even while _RARE_ , surface and depth . STO
* The process of _RARE_ seemed _RARE_ , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from _RARE_ with the illusion . STO
* It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and _RARE_ step of _RARE_ actual pieces of _RARE_ wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to _RARE_ its texture in paint . STO
* Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of _RARE_ , when he glued a piece of _RARE_ _RARE_ to a painting on canvas . STO
* It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than _RARE_ , which would confirm the date he _RARE_ it . STO
* But it is also true that Braque was the consistent _RARE_ in the use of simulated _RARE_ as well as of _RARE_ ; ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the _RARE_ of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . STO
* When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each . STO
* ( It makes no real difference that _RARE_ collage is on paper and _RARE_ out in charcoal , while _RARE_ is on canvas and _RARE_ out in oil . STO
* ) By its greater _RARE_ presence and its greater _RARE_ , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated _RARE_ had ever done . STO
* But here again , the _RARE_ device both _RARE_ and falls short of its aim . STO
* For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in _RARE_ , which gives way in turn , and with equal _RARE_ , to an illusion that seems to contain both -- or neither . STO
* Because of the size of the areas it covers , the pasted paper _RARE_ _RARE_ flatness _RARE_ , as more than an indication or sign . STO
* _RARE_ flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device _RARE_ : the illusion of depth is rendered even more _RARE_ than before . STO
* Instead of _RARE_ the literal flatness by _RARE_ and _RARE_ it , the pasted paper or cloth _RARE_ and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this _RARE_ flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture . STO
* The actual surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns out -- suddenly and _RARE_ -- that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in front of , upon , the surface . STO
* In their very first _RARE_ , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real , _RARE_ space -- or to be about to do so -- while the rest of the subject remains _RARE_ in , or flat upon , the surface . STO
* And the surface is driven back , in its very _RARE_ , only by this contrast . STO
* In the upper center of _RARE_ first collage , _RARE_ _RARE_ ( in _RARE_ _RARE_ collection ) , a bunch of _RARE_ is rendered with such _RARE_ vivid _RARE_ effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane . STO
* The _RARE_ illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel _RARE_ , but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it . STO
* Yet the violent _RARE_ of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only _RARE_ _RARE_ of block _RARE_ that _RARE_ window _RARE_ , manage somehow to push the _RARE_ cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` jump '' . STO
* At the same time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of _RARE_ _RARE_ upon them , and by their placing in relation to the block _RARE_ ; ; and these _RARE_ seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing , and by contrast with the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane ; ; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the _RARE_ and ambiguous one that each has with the surface . STO
* And the same thing , more or less , can be said of the contents of _RARE_ first collage . STO
* In later _RARE_ of both _RARE_ , a variety of _RARE_ materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in conjunction with every other _RARE_ and _RARE_ device they can think of . STO
* The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material -- or simply of a _RARE_ form -- will be shaded to _RARE_ that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth . STO
* _RARE_ defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested _RARE_ which is greater than that established _RARE_ . STO
* All this _RARE_ the _RARE_ between surface and depth so as to _RARE_ _RARE_ space in front of the surface as well as behind it . STO
* _RARE_ may now _RARE_ everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself -- at least an optical if not , properly speaking , a _RARE_ illusion . STO
* _RARE_ , Cubist flatness is now almost completely _RARE_ to the literal , _RARE_ kind , but at the same time it _RARE_ upon and largely _RARE_ the _RARE_ kind -- and it does so , moreover , without _RARE_ the latter of its _RARE_ ; ; rather , it _RARE_ and _RARE_ that _RARE_ , _RARE_ it . STO
* Out of this _RARE_ _RARE_ , the Cubist subject _RARE_ . STO
* For it had turned out , by a further _RARE_ of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and _RARE_ had now become widely _RARE_ from the means of representation or _RARE_ . STO
* In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize _RARE_ simply in order to preserve it ; ; they had also had to _RARE_ it -- to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became _RARE_ from specific three-dimensional _RARE_ and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such : as a _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ property detached from everything not itself . STO
* In order to be saved , _RARE_ had had to be isolated ; ; and as the aspect of the subject was _RARE_ into those _RARE_ of more or less _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ by which _RARE_ was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely _RARE_ . STO
* Cubism , in its _RARE_ phase ( which the French , with justice , call `` _RARE_ '' ) was on the _RARE_ of abstract art . STO
* It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation . STO
* If they _RARE_ for illusion , it could only be illusion per _RARE_ -- an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and _RARE_ as to _RARE_ the representation of individual objects . STO
* If , on the other hand , they _RARE_ for representation , it had to be representation per _RARE_ -- representation as image pure and simple , without _RARE_ ( at least , without more than _RARE_ ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed . STO
* It was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear : the _RARE_ could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for the first time , mutually exclusive _RARE_ . STO
* In the end , Picasso and Braque _RARE_ for the _RARE_ , and it would seem they did so deliberately . STO
* ( This provides whatever real _RARE_ there is for the talk about `` reality '' . STO
* ) But the inner , formal logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with _RARE_ their decision . STO
* When the smaller _RARE_ of Analytical Cubism were placed upon or _RARE_ with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to _RARE_ -- become `` _RARE_ '' -- into larger _RARE_ shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the _RARE_ of the picture plane . STO
* _RARE_ in their previous _RARE_ _RARE_ , they would have cut away too abruptly into depth ; ; and the broad , _RARE_ shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane . STO
* Large planes _RARE_ with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to the extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as _RARE_ ; ; and independent _RARE_ are apt to coincide with the _RARE_ contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) . STO
* It was because of this _RARE_ as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the _RARE_ unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects , or at least parts of them , _RARE_ in _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and continued to remain more _RARE_ there -- but only as _RARE_ _RARE_ -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . STO
* Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; ; nor did _RARE_ Cubism fully begin there . STO
* Only when the collage had been _RARE_ translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , _RARE_ _RARE_ whose _RARE_ and placement created _RARE_ to , if not the illusion of , _RARE_ three-dimensional _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in _RARE_ ; ; this was the point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist _RARE_ away from Braque , never again to _RARE_ it . STO
* But even before that , Picasso had _RARE_ and entered , for a moment , a certain _RARE_ path in which no one had preceded him . STO
* It was as though , in that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too _RARE_ and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back -- or forward -- to literal _RARE_ . STO
* This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in general ) literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane . STO
* Some time in 1912 , Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a _RARE_ ; ; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut _RARE_ , thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and _RARE_ space to which there clung only the _RARE_ of a picture plane . STO
* The affixed elements of collage were _RARE_ , as it were , and cut off from the literal _RARE_ surface to form a _RARE_ . STO
* Los Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the _RARE_ . STO
* ) And without high density in the core , _RARE_ systems cannot be maintained _RARE_ , let alone built from scratch at today's prices . STO
* However , the building of _RARE_ and garages cannot continue forever . STO
* The new _RARE_ among the four Los Angeles _RARE_ , including the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , _RARE_ of a square mile , an area about the size of _RARE_ Center in New York . STO
* It is hard to believe that this mass of _RARE_ concrete constitutes what the law calls `` the highest and best use '' of _RARE_ located urban land . STO
* As it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an _RARE_ is _RARE_ ; ; it _RARE_ forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . STO
* _RARE_ improved land values without taking away land ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the _RARE_ that can be taxed . STO
* _RARE_ Los Angeles is already _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , street , parking lot and garage -- one of those _RARE_ `` if '' statistics has already come to pass . STO
* The _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ concentrates and _RARE_ the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , _RARE_ boundary . STO
* City _RARE_ do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might . STO
* Less ambitious _RARE_ plans may be more successful -- especially when the _RARE_ and _RARE_ are raised , allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the _RARE_ . STO
* Meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance . STO
* In ever greater numbers , factories are locating in the suburbs or in `` industrial _RARE_ '' removed from the city's political jurisdiction . STO
* The appeal of the _RARE_ is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor . STO
* To light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much _RARE_ , but efficiency engineers usually believe in them , and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers . STO
* This movement of industry away from the central cities is not so _RARE_ new as some _RARE_ seem to believe . STO
* It is merely the latest example of the _RARE_ growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities . STO
* The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities -- the rubber factories in _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ plants , U.S. _RARE_ _RARE_ works -- often began on these _RARE_ at a time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( _RARE_ ) and power ( river ) . STO
* The `` _RARE_ '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam _RARE_ , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet _RARE_ . STO
* The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site . STO
* Until internal _RARE_ became cheap , he had to be near a railroad _RARE_ and a _RARE_ line or an existing large community of lower-class homes . STO
* The railroad _RARE_ is still important -- it is usually , though not always , true that _RARE_ _RARE_ by rail is _RARE_ than _RARE_ . STO
* But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad . STO
* And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and _RARE_ bus lines , is actually more convenient than the _RARE_ factory . STO
* _RARE_ Run , General _RARE_ enormous installations at _RARE_ and _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , _RARE_ in _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ in Los Angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere -- none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit . STO
* They are all suburban plants , _RARE_ on the roads to keep them supplied with workers . STO
* And wherever the new _RARE_ go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry . STO
* The drive along _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston , may be a vision of the future . STO
* The future could be worse . STO
* The plants along _RARE_ _RARE_ are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England rocks and trees . STO
* They can even be rather grand , like Edward _RARE_ monument to the astonishing success of _RARE_ . STO
* But they deny the values of the city -- the crowded , competitive , _RARE_ city , the `` melting pot '' which gave off so many of the most _RARE_ American qualities . STO
* They are segregated businesses , _RARE_ again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work force from segregated communities . STO
* It is interesting to note how many of the plants on _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ draw most of their income either from the government in _RARE_ _RARE_ arrangements , or from the _RARE_ of patents which grant at least a partial _RARE_ . STO
* While the factories were always the center of the labor market , they were often on the city's _RARE_ . STO
* In spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities . STO
* Even the loss of hotel business to the _RARE_ motel has been relatively _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ is becoming harder to find every year . STO
* What _RARE_ most is the damage the automobile has done to _RARE_ retailing , especially in those cities where public transit is feeble . STO
* Some retailing , of course , always spreads with the population -- _RARE_ stores , _RARE_ , local _RARE_ and dress shops , _RARE_ stores and the like . STO
* But whenever a major purchase was _RARE_ forty years ago -- a new bedroom set or a winter coat , an _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ for _RARE_ -- the family set off for the downtown department store , where the selection would be greatest . STO
* Department stores _RARE_ in the `` one hundred per cent location '' , where all the transit lines _RARE_ . STO
* These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' _RARE_ more and more dry goods . STO
* If the _RARE_ and _RARE_ downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put in the bank . STO
* In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially _RARE_ . STO
* No suburban _RARE_ branch -- not even _RARE_ vast _RARE_ outside _RARE_ -- does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of _RARE_ to be found in the home store . STO
* Telephone orders _RARE_ the picture : the _RARE_ naturally calls a local rather than a _RARE_ number if both are listed in an _RARE_ , especially if the local call _RARE_ city sales tax . STO
* The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened . STO
* _RARE_ procedures which continue to charge a _RARE_ overhead and _RARE_ expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are . STO
* In many cases that statement -- `` We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' -- would be turned around if the cost analysis were _RARE_ on terms less _RARE_ to the old store . STO
* _RARE_ of the competition -- always a great _RARE_ force in the American economy -- makes _RARE_ who do not have suburban operations _RARE_ both the volume and the _RARE_ of their _RARE_ _RARE_ new branches . STO
* The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are _RARE_ , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly _RARE_ cities will support only so many big branches . STO
* Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative _RARE_ who act as _RARE_ for retail giants are beginning to discover . STO
* When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing . STO
* Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store , though both are the same distance from home . STO
* Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . STO
* Raymond _RARE_ reports that residents of East St. Louis have been driving across the _RARE_ , through the heart of downtown St. Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . STO
* To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ , Ohio , can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door . STO
* If the distant _RARE_ of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the _RARE_ to do something about the _RARE_ or await the completion of the federal highway program . STO
* And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the _RARE_ urban mass which supports the downtown department store , the central location may be in serious trouble . STO
* Today , according to land _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some _RARE_ acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land area in all the _RARE_ Central _RARE_ _RARE_ put together . STO
* The downtown store continues to offer the great _RARE_ of variety , both within its _RARE_ and across the street , where other department stores are immediately convenient for the _RARE_ who wants to see what is available before making up her mind . STO
* If anything may be predicted in the _RARE_ world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to _RARE_ children's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too much of a production ) , household _RARE_ and the discount business in _RARE_ items . STO
* Department stores were built on dry goods , especially ladies' _RARE_ , and in this area , in the long run , the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown . STO
* If this analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn out to be what _RARE_ cost _RARE_ refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations rather than major factors . STO
* _RARE_ in America the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered . STO
* `` How _RARE_ gonna keep 'em down on the farm '' ? STO
* Was a question that had to be asked long before they saw _RARE_ . STO
* Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and _RARE_ of downtown . STO
* Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this _RARE_ -- and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , _RARE_ foreseen by so many urban _RARE_ , is actually upon us . STO
* 4 . STO
* _RARE_ and Negroes In their book , American _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ and Henry Hope _RARE_ argue that _RARE_ _RARE_ New _RARE_ was what made the modern _RARE_ a possibility -- a fine _RARE_ argument , when you consider how _RARE_ tend to vote . STO
* The first _RARE_ -- New _RARE_ Henry Hudson and _RARE_ Lake _RARE_ , San _RARE_ Bay Bridge and its approaches , a good _RARE_ of the Pennsylvania _RARE_ -- were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression . STO
* At the same time , _RARE_ Federal _RARE_ Administration , coupled with Henry _RARE_ _RARE_ policy , permitted ordinary _RARE_ families to build their own homes . STO
* _RARE_ who had been reluctant to _RARE_ without better security than the house itself got that security from the U. S. government ; ; _RARE_ who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term _RARE_ _RARE_ found they could _RARE_ for twenty-five years at 4 per cent , under government _RARE_ . STO
* Before losing itself in the sands of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance _RARE_ decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi _RARE_ of the Capitol _RARE_ in Washington . STO
* The artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more _RARE_ standard of execution , and tended to _RARE_ _RARE_ of conception where _RARE_ and weakness were easy to find . STO
* But it is a great conception . STO
* The open ceiling , with _RARE_ and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of _RARE_ and his _RARE_ followers . STO
* The _RARE_ may be remote , but this is surely the only _RARE_ example of that vigorous _RARE_ in the United States . STO
* _RARE_ Brumidi designed the _RARE_ scheme as a whole , in _RARE_ with the _RARE_ Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of _RARE_ with the present much larger iron structure . STO
* After many years and many _RARE_ he was able to finish the _RARE_ fresco , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the _RARE_ group opposite the East door , and ending with William _RARE_ , all but one leg , when a tragic accident ended his career . STO
* He left at his death sketches , drawn to scale , for the rest of the circle . STO
* These were carried out not too _RARE_ by _RARE_ Costaggini , who began by supplying the missing member to the _RARE_ of Pennsylvania and _RARE_ in pencil , in Italian , that he `` began at this point '' . STO
* When Costaggini had used up all the sketches _RARE_ feet of empty frieze were left over . STO
* A blank _RARE_ void , _RARE_ in _RARE_ , _RARE_ the wall of the _RARE_ until 1951 . STO
* Then , advised by the _RARE_ of the Capitol , the _RARE_ Committee for the _RARE_ , _RARE_ responsible for the works of art in the building , ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco , to show `` the Peace after the Civil War '' , `` the _RARE_ War '' , and `` the _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' , to match as nearly as feasible Brumidi's technique and composition . STO
* Later the cleaning and restoration were ordered , first of the older part of the frieze , finally of the _RARE_ . STO
* What follows is therefore a description of three separate _RARE_ , the new _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ , with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each . STO
* For the use of students and future _RARE_ , a full , _RARE_ record was kept of all three _RARE_ , complete technical reports on what we found and what we did . STO
* These may be consulted in the office of the _RARE_ of the Capitol , or the _RARE_ of Congress . STO
* The first preliminary was _RARE_ the _RARE_ length of frieze , a _RARE_ of _RARE_ and finish coats , all in bad condition . STO
* It was decided to strip the whole area down to the _RARE_ , and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older _RARE_ preparation , with a mortar , one part _RARE_ lime , three parts sand , to be put on in two layers . STO
* _RARE_ were drawn full size , after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities . STO
* There was some difficulty here . STO
* One had to manage the given subjects , three diverse recent events , so as to make them part of a classical frieze , -- that is , a pattern of large figures filling the space , with not much else , against a blank background . STO
* Moreover , all three representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length Brumidi allowed for each one of his . STO
* When it was all arranged to fit , and not to _RARE_ the _RARE_ flow of movement in the frieze , the _RARE_ were tried in place . STO
* The _RARE_ , a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the _RARE_ above , was strong and safe , but obscured _RARE_ . STO
* Nothing could be seen from the floor , but by moving around the _RARE_ one could get _RARE_ ; ; and we were able to decide on some _RARE_ of scale . STO
* To be sure of matching color as well as form , pieces of _RARE_ were _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , and large samples painted in fresco , then left two months to dry out to their final key . STO
* Later it was _RARE_ to note that they had set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came . STO
* The _RARE_ was the length of the space to be painted . STO
* What bits of Brumidi and Costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good order , though the _RARE_ sandy surface was thick with dust . STO
* _RARE_ , they came out surprisingly clear and bright . STO
* It could be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster , one half inch , and that both followed the traditional Italian fresco technique as described by _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and current in Italy to this day . STO
* That is , they used _RARE_ color throughout , getting solid _RARE_ with active lime white . STO
* _RARE_ `` a _RARE_ '' is much in evidence . STO
* A brown _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ shadows , and much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat . STO
* This brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint . STO
* In our own practice , to have the last `` _RARE_ '' plaster coat thick enough to match , and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in drying , we found that it had to be put on in two layers , letting the first set _RARE_ before applying the second . STO
* The mortar was three parts sand to two of lime . STO
* Some of the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol basement for plaster repairs was _RARE_ several months for us ; ; but to make it _RARE_ , of a really _RARE_ consistency to avoid cracking , we added a little _RARE_ lime -- hard on the hands , but we could see no other _RARE_ . STO
* I am told that a mortar longer _RARE_ might have remained longer in condition for painting . STO
* As it was , it took the pigment well for six hours , enough for our purpose , and held it firmly in setting . STO
* It was obvious that to match Brumidi , white must be mixed with all but the _RARE_ tones . STO
* _RARE_ white , hard and brilliant , has a tendency to `` jump '' away from the other colors in drying , and also by its capacity to set , to _RARE_ the use of _RARE_ _RARE_ , so useful in _RARE_ work . STO
* In older Italian practice , lime , dried and _RARE_ `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , entered into such prepared shades . STO
* For convenience we chose a stronger pigment , unknown to the early _RARE_ or to Brumidi , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ the active lime white for highest lights , put on at the end of the day's _RARE_ . STO
* Other _RARE_ were mostly raw _RARE_ , some _RARE_ _RARE_ , and a little yellow _RARE_ . STO
* This last was probably not in Brumidi's _RARE_ , but was needed to take the chill , _RARE_ look off the new work next to the old , where _RARE_ effects of time were seen , even after thorough cleaning . STO
* The use of `` _RARE_ '' we tried to restrict to covering _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ showed , however , that it is very difficult to paint a dark _RARE_ background in fresco that will not dry out _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Later Brumidi and Costaggini will be seen coping with this same problem . STO
* We were forced , as they were , to work a good deal of _RARE_ into background and dark areas . STO
* We made it by _RARE_ _RARE_ , five parts thoroughly washed cheese _RARE_ to one of lime _RARE_ ; ; ground together they made a strong adhesive , which became _RARE_ in drying . STO
* Figure 1 was taken in 1953 . STO
* The new part is finished . STO
* On the right is the Brumidi _RARE_ group , as it looked after cleaning operations , which had not yet come around to the other end ; ; where , of Costaggini , only some _RARE_ has been washed , at the point where his work stopped . STO
* One is led to speculate as to why the empty space was there , left for our century to finish . STO
* Costaggini said it was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle . STO
* Brumidi's son later maintained that Costaggini had compressed and _RARE_ his father's _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ a bit he could claim for his very own . STO
* This question might be settled by comparing the measurement of the actual _RARE_ with the dimensions noted , presumably in Brumidi's hand , above the various sections of his long _RARE_ drawing , which has been kept . STO
* _RARE_ fault , it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his `` _RARE_ '' and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of California gold . STO
* In painting a fresco , the handling of wet mortar _RARE_ one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right , not to _RARE_ _RARE_ work with today's _RARE_ . STO
* At the very first , then , Brumidi was required , by the _RARE_ _RARE_ shape of his central group , to fill in the _RARE_ space above the seated girl on _RARE_ right , before starting on the _RARE_ figures themselves . STO
* Here he put a small man , whose missing hands might have left his function doubtful , until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning , this was to be the closing figure of the party of `` _RARE_ '' , and was to hold a basket . STO
* One sees _RARE_ rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away . STO
* The photograph , Figure 1 of the completed frieze , shows how , having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for eighty years , he has now been given a hand , and by _RARE_ ( and the permission of the Committee ) , given a new job , to represent the witnesses of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ bright effect of the first _RARE_ led the Committee to order the rest of the _RARE_ cycle cleaned and restored to go with them . STO
* The fixed wooden _RARE_ was removed , and , so as to reach all the frieze , one of pipe , on wheels , built up from the floor . STO
* Every few days , in the early morning , as the work progressed , twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the _RARE_ pavement , supported as it is by ancient brick _RARE_ . STO
* On this _RARE_ and _RARE_ platform over fifty feet from the floor , after a first dusting , we began to wash . STO
* A most useful tool for _RARE_ the surface without running down was made from a _RARE_ `` mist spray '' _RARE_ _RARE_ to a hose connection , to be used at low water pressure . STO
* A _RARE_ in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower . STO
* One man _RARE_ , with a _RARE_ in hand to check excess _RARE_ . STO
* A second assistant _RARE_ with two _RARE_ . STO
* In parts a repeated _RARE_ was needed , but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore the original brightness . STO
* No soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in unwanted chemical reactions . STO
* The painting `` a fresco '' stood up _RARE_ ; ; a little of the `` _RARE_ '' came off . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ was put on at once . STO
* _RARE_ we found the _RARE_ first rate , especially Brumidi's . STO
* We were greatly helped by there being no _RARE_ of former _RARE_ . STO
* Apparently not more than dusting had ever been done , and not much of that . STO
* The plaster was sound , the _RARE_ firmly attached all over , and the pigment solidly incorporated with it in all but a few unimportant places . STO
* The greatest source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly _RARE_ from _RARE_ above , soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime , very _RARE_ even after cleaning , particularly in the `` _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ and the Indians '' , and `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* Here the _RARE_ , referring to the use of the Capitol as a public building , not a _RARE_ , requested some _RARE_ to maintain _RARE_ effect , rather than leaving blank , _RARE_ patches . STO
* These _RARE_ have had no care for eighty years . STO
* With naked gas _RARE_ below and _RARE_ windows above , enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium , they have survived , in a building long _RARE_ in winter , hot and damp under the iron dome in summer . STO
* Those whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me . STO
* It may well be that , when _RARE_ Pozzatti and I visited your country last spring , you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked . STO
* As American artists , it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as possible . STO
* This letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful . STO
* Even though we did not see many of your faces , it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard , from those whom we had the fortune to encounter , that we had been in your midst . STO
* I am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R. . STO
* I can well understand your curiosity . STO
* We , ourselves , are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live . STO
* It is my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the Union of Soviet Artists . STO
* There should be no reason to _RARE_ or ignore the intent of this letter . STO
* Pozzatti and I _RARE_ earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ of little more than a month cannot _RARE_ me to _RARE_ as an expert on anything I saw . STO
* Too much damage is done by `` experts '' who have spent even less time , if any at all , in the U.S.S.R. . STO
* Nevertheless I consider it reasonable , because of my _RARE_ as an artist , to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific _RARE_ interests . STO
* If this attitude is seriously questioned in the Soviet Union , it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which I live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view . STO
* It is a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own _RARE_ are too _RARE_ to _RARE_ any symbolic significance to the _RARE_ of a minority , such as artists , in any social order . STO
* I encountered many questions and great interest upon my return from the Soviet Union about my reactions to that experience . STO
* That which I found most profound and most disturbing appeared to _RARE_ a curiously _RARE_ reaction . STO
* Almost as if I were talking about something quite _RARE_ . STO
* Apparently this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen _RARE_ , or at least _RARE_ , to individual impressions of a subject which _RARE_ a good deal of their waking moments . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ tend to blunt the ear and , in turn , the voice as well . STO
* I cannot be content with the _RARE_ small talk of a somewhat unusual _RARE_ . STO
* I am equally impatient with the _RARE_ of the shoulder , shake of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so long ; ; the aggressive _RARE_ of those who are _RARE_ lost in a semantic jungle of the word `` _RARE_ '' ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ by the sick _RARE_ of ignorance who try to build a _RARE_ wall of _RARE_ on our physical _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ as it may have been at times , Pozzatti and I saw enough , talked to enough artists , _RARE_ and others to realize that the issue is quite clear . STO
* Artists and poets are the raw _RARE_ of humanity ; ; they are small in number and their contribution is not immediately _RARE_ in everyday life . STO
* By themselves they may not be able to save the life on this planet , but without them there would be very little left worth saving . STO
* It cannot be said that our very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one . STO
* On that cold , but bright , April day we were guests of your government in the _RARE_ stand of Red Square to witness the _RARE_ celebration for _RARE_ _RARE_ and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* If we thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people _RARE_ a new hero and a great national achievement , our last day , to us at least , was equally impressive and very moving , even though the _RARE_ were absent and there was almost complete silence . STO
* We stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country just outside of _RARE_ looking at silent flowers on the grave of a Russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor . STO
* The grave , about _RARE_ between his home and the blue _RARE_ of a small church , rose above the forms and spaces of gently _RARE_ _RARE_ of green , the sounds of birds , the silence of other graves and the casual _RARE_ through small _RARE_ . STO
* Just yesterday we had met and talked with a living writer , a contemporary of the dead poet , who is known for his ability of _RARE_ his ideas and his craft more _RARE_ . STO
* But today we were aware of only two men . STO
* One had taken a flight into _RARE_ space , in the service of science , to return as a living hero . STO
* The other had assumed the right to explore the equally _RARE_ space of the human spirit . STO
* The flowers on his grave _RARE_ to the fact that he as well was _RARE_ hero . STO
* These two _RARE_ form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which , to me at least , _RARE_ the _RARE_ in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* A struggle that is being _RARE_ all over the world in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was _RARE_ even further with an incredible semantic _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ environment , it was stated , had _RARE_ these two extreme _RARE_ and was about to produce a new plant and fruit . STO
* When I _RARE_ on one such occasion that the new growth , like other _RARE_ , might be unable to _RARE_ , I was immediately accused of preaching racial prejudice . STO
* I could not bring myself to answer that `` some of my best friends are _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* This kind of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to . STO
* After a while we were perhaps less surprised , but still puzzled , when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A chance remark about _RARE_ sealed train brought the _RARE_ that this was a myth _RARE_ to George _RARE_ _RARE_ tree . STO
* _RARE_ of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific _RARE_ concerning the _RARE_ of _RARE_ masses . STO
* No wonder that Pozzatti and I had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence , namely , _RARE_ Exchange . STO
* _RARE_ of such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the Union of Soviet Artists . STO
* We had looked forward to what we hoped to be our first informal meeting with a number of _RARE_ artists . STO
* Instead , we became involved in a series of friendly , but _RARE_ formal , _RARE_ addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind . STO
* The terms of friendship , understanding , cooperation , etc. , tend to become somewhat _RARE_ because of constant and _RARE_ use . STO
* I can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion . STO
* The _RARE_ female _RARE_ , of massive proportions and _RARE_ appearance , initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing the arts . STO
* It was only after we had responded , with what I fear were similar _RARE_ , that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and _RARE_ actions by the U.S. Government in Cuba and _RARE_ . STO
* She retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there . STO
* Unfortunately she returned later , just as I had taken advantage of the _RARE_ atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the _RARE_ Exchange Program would be the _RARE_ of _RARE_ Art in Russia , with Social _RARE_ _RARE_ dominance in the U.S. . STO
* This gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the _RARE_ _RARE_ that we should not _RARE_ to lecture her on _RARE_ . STO
* She did not go so far as to say , as was done on other occasions , that _RARE_ as well as _RARE_ were a Russian invention that had been _RARE_ as unwanted by the people of the U.S.S.R. . STO
* Pozzatti and I could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in _RARE_ than elsewhere . STO
* We were to discover , in fact , that quite a number of people share with us the impression that , in contrast to other Soviet regions , _RARE_ atmosphere is _RARE_ subdued and official . STO
* To have one's intentions deliberately or _RARE_ misunderstood is always a waste of time . STO
* Until our _RARE_ experience , I had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or _RARE_ . STO
* Artists simply do not talk to each other in that fashion ; ; and , _RARE_ , I could not _RARE_ the implication that I spoke for American artists as a group . STO
* To save time , some _RARE_ seemed necessary . STO
* The following is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in _RARE_ : `` We have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and _RARE_ your ideas and your ways . STO
* Our presence here should also be considered further , sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer , peaceful ties among all people . STO
* We are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the informal contacts and _RARE_ of ideas between individuals . STO
* In spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you , we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit . STO
* We are _RARE_ aware that yours is a society which , in spite of several wars and many _RARE_ , has developed itself into one of the _RARE_ nations of the world . STO
* Your past history is _RARE_ with the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* Your present history is equally _RARE_ for its industrial and scientific achievements . STO
* We have come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to _RARE_ you with that of ours . STO
* While we , as American artists , believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity , we would be less than honest with you , or ourselves , if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole . STO
* In stating this position , we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists and _RARE_ in other lands to share our opinion in every respect . STO
* As a matter of fact , we _RARE_ the diversity among our own people so much that we will not _RARE_ to speak for all other American artists . STO
* But certainly , all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for _RARE_ between you and us , but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of _RARE_ . STO
* Like yourselves , we have pride and love for our country . STO
* To many of us , this is a land to which we or our parents fled from _RARE_ terror in order to live in dignified freedom . STO
* As artists we feel the same obligation , as do other individuals , in considering ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation . STO
* The _RARE_ Society is an ambitious work . STO
* Its scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ? STO
* A work so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily `` fail '' . STO
* Even a _RARE_ reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots , errors of fact and argument , important _RARE_ , areas of ignorance and prejudice , undue _RARE_ on _RARE_ , examples of broad positions supported by _RARE_ evidence , and the like . STO
* Such books are easy prey for critics . STO
* Nor need the _RARE_ be _RARE_ . STO
* A careful and orderly man , who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility , might easily be put off by such a book . STO
* It is a simple matter , for one so _RARE_ , to take a work like The _RARE_ Society and _RARE_ it into odds and ends . STO
* The thing can be made to look like the _RARE_ attic of a large and vigorous family -- a _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ objects , some _RARE_ and some that were never useful , some once whole and bright but now _RARE_ and _RARE_ , some odd pieces whose history no one _RARE_ , here and there a _RARE_ , everything fascinating because it suggests some part of the human condition -- the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse into the _RARE_ history of the _RARE_ and users . STO
* That could be easily done , but there is little reason in it . STO
* It would come down to saying that Fromm _RARE_ with a broad brush , and that , after all , is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the _RARE_ . STO
* I mention these features of the book because they are inherent in the _RARE_ character and therefore must be mentioned . STO
* It would be _RARE_ to build a _RARE_ around them . STO
* There are more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm's account of _RARE_ civilization . STO
* It is _RARE_ to recall that Fromm's treatment has both descriptive and _RARE_ aspects . STO
* Since I have already discussed his moral position , that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages , which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm's treatment . STO
* I shall first indicate a couple of _RARE_ in Fromm's analysis , then argue that , granted these _RARE_ , he still has much left that is valuable , and , finally , raise the general question of a philosophical versus a _RARE_ approach to the question of alienation . STO
* Almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation . STO
* Despite its rather long intellectual history , alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a _RARE_ theory . STO
* The idea has received much attention in philosophy , in literature , and in a few works of general social criticism , such as The _RARE_ Society . STO
* What is missing is work that would answer , presumably by the use of survey methods and _RARE_ attitude _RARE_ , such questions as these : What are the components of the _RARE_ described as alienation ? STO
* How widespread is alienation ? STO
* What is its _RARE_ among the various classes and subgroups of the population ? STO
* _RARE_ alienation as a dependent variable , with what _RARE_ factors is it most highly associated ? STO
* _RARE_ as an independent variable , how does it affect behavior in various sectors of life ? STO
* Until such work is done , there must remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the _RARE_ of the intellectual , who , rejected by and in turn _RARE_ the larger society , projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen . STO
* I am not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this kind of work . STO
* Nor do I think that alienation is nothing more than a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of the intellectual . STO
* I am saying only that until a _RARE_ and different kind of evidence comes in , any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations . STO
* Until such evidence appears , we must make do with the evidence we have . STO
* Here , perhaps , Fromm is vulnerable , for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available , and he sometimes _RARE_ and _RARE_ the evidence in rather special ways . STO
* Three examples follow . STO
* Fromm's analysis of alienation in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the _RARE_ of the corporation , the separation of ownership from control , and the broad ( and thus from the point of view of corporate control , _RARE_ ) _RARE_ of stock ownership . STO
* For all these points he _RARE_ exclusively on _RARE_ and _RARE_ study of _RARE_ , The _RARE_ Corporation And _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The broad conclusions of that _RARE_ work remain _RARE_ , but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support , has suggested important _RARE_ in the general analytic frame of reference , and has _RARE_ the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area . STO
* Fromm seems unaware of these developments . STO
* Another example is his very _RARE_ use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of _RARE_ : he cites such _RARE_ findings just three times . STO
* Moreover , the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible . STO
* For example , he cites the following data from two studies on job satisfaction : in the first study , 85 per cent of professionals and _RARE_ , _RARE_ per cent of white collar people , and _RARE_ per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with their jobs ; ; in the second study , the _RARE_ were _RARE_ for professionals , _RARE_ for _RARE_ persons , 42 for commercial employees , _RARE_ for skilled workers , and _RARE_ for _RARE_ workers . STO
* He _RARE_ that these data show a `` remarkably high '' percentage of consciously _RARE_ and unhappy persons among factory and _RARE_ workers . STO
* _RARE_ from other value _RARE_ than Fromm's , some _RARE_ might conclude that the _RARE_ really tell us very little at all , while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , for example , once said that America was a _RARE_ -- the only one in the history of the world -- for _RARE_ and small children . STO
* What matters is that while Fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible , it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied . STO
* Fromm also cites a _RARE_ on attitudes toward work restriction conducted by the _RARE_ Research Corporation in 1945 , in which _RARE_ per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a day's work , while _RARE_ per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount . STO
* Fromm says these data show that job _RARE_ and resentment are widespread . STO
* That is one way to read the findings , but again there are other ways . STO
* One might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary associations in the factory , an interpretation which would run counter to Fromm's theory of alienation . STO
* Or , he might _RARE_ Fromm that the _RARE_ per cent figure is really _RARE_ low : after all , the medieval _RARE_ system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount ; ; and today's trade unions announce pretty much the same view . STO
* In view of these _RARE_ in both the amount and the interpretation of _RARE_ findings on public opinion , and considering the criticisms which can be brought against Fromm's philosophical _RARE_ , such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously . STO
* `` Are people happy , are they as satisfied , unconsciously , as they believe themselves to be ? STO
* _RARE_ the nature of man , and the conditions for happiness , this can hardly be so '' . STO
* The _RARE_ suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought . STO
* He seems to use the term alienation in two different ways . STO
* Sometimes he uses it as a subjective , descriptive term , and sometimes as an objective , diagnostic one . STO
* That is , sometimes it is used to describe felt human _RARE_ , and other times it is _RARE_ to explain _RARE_ anxiety and _RARE_ . STO
* The failure to keep these two _RARE_ distinct presents _RARE_ to the reader . STO
* It also permits Fromm to do some _RARE_ things with empirical findings . STO
* When alienation is used as an objective and diagnostic category , for example , it becomes clear that Fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward _RARE_ it . STO
* ( He , in effect , does say this in his discussion of the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* ) _RARE_ from this , and accepting his estimate of the _RARE_ of modern society , it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a _RARE_ survey which reported widespread , stated worker satisfaction , rather than widespread , stated worker _RARE_ . STO
* The point is that in a system such as Fromm's which recognizes unconscious _RARE_ , and which rests on certain ethical _RARE_ , empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is _RARE_ at the moment . STO
* Thus , in the example _RARE_ above Fromm rests his whole case on the _RARE_ that the workers are being deprived unconsciously , _RARE_ , of fulfillment , and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious , experienced _RARE_ . STO
* He has his cake and _RARE_ it too : if the workers say they are _RARE_ , this shows conscious alienation ; ; if they say they are satisfied , this shows unconscious alienation . STO
* This sort of _RARE_ is especially troublesome in Fromm's work because , although his system is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions , he _RARE_ that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own _RARE_ room . STO
* While the `` empirical _RARE_ '' label which Fromm claims _RARE_ no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy , it does increase the _RARE_ of his product . STO
* The final example of the failure to use available evidence , though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered , comes from Fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same _RARE_ . STO
* In a brief chapter dealing with `` _RARE_ Other _RARE_ '' , he _RARE_ isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to _RARE_ his own , and finds it `` most remarkable that a critical view of _RARE_ society was already held by a number of _RARE_ living in the nineteenth . STO
* '' He finds it equally `` remarkable that their critical diagnosis and _RARE_ should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of the _RARE_ century '' . STO
* There is nothing remarkable about this at all . STO
* It is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes . STO
* There is a difference between evidence and illustration , and Fromm's _RARE_ of the other _RARE_ _RARE_ the latter category . STO
* _RARE_ at the list : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , London , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , A. R. _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* This is a _RARE_ _RARE_ collection . STO
* One can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear . STO
* The method of selection Fromm uses _RARE_ exactly that . STO
* Furthermore , the list is interesting for its _RARE_ . STO
* It _RARE_ , for example , practically the whole line of great nineteenth century English social critics , nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious , and all those who are with more or less accuracy called _RARE_ . STO
* Of course , the list also _RARE_ all writers who are fairly `` _RARE_ '' about the modern situation ; ; these , almost by definition , are _RARE_ for an _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It is not hard to find that _RARE_ of opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion . STO
* Turning from these problems of the use of evidence , one meets another type of difficulty in Fromm's analysis , which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important terms . STO
* One such instance has already been presented : his use of alienation . STO
* The only other one I shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism . STO
* For Fromm , capitalism is the enemy , the root of all evil . STO
* It is of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one's social criticism , for it makes diagnosis and _RARE_ much easier than they might otherwise be . STO
* If one characteristic _RARE_ Boris _RARE_ , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . STO
* Much of this _RARE_ quality results from _RARE_ care in _RARE_ his vocal line on natural speech _RARE_ . STO
* In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such _RARE_ as _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to their own languages . STO
* Through long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian _RARE_ as different from others as the language itself . STO
* _RARE_ most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he _RARE_ the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . STO
* The moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Otherwise Mussorgsky _RARE_ his vocal _RARE_ for prolonged expressions of emotion -- _RARE_ first _RARE_ , for example . STO
* Even then , the flexibility of the _RARE_ suggests that the word comes first in importance . STO
* _RARE_ from Boris himself , one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the _RARE_ of musical _RARE_ . STO
* Even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full _RARE_ , defined with economical precision . STO
* Consider the four _RARE_ who figure prominently in the action : Pimen , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and the _RARE_ Rangoni . STO
* Under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other ; ; each musical setting has an individual touch . STO
* Pimen is an old man , weak in body -- his voice rarely rises to a full _RARE_ -- but firm and clear of mind . STO
* His _RARE_ offers contrast to _RARE_ _RARE_ excitement . STO
* A quiet but sturdy theme , somewhat _RARE_ in character , appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life : This theme comes to represent the outer world , the realm of _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- seen from a distance , quite distinct from the _RARE_ spiritual life in the _RARE_ . STO
* It changes and _RARE_ according to the text ; ; it _RARE_ Pimen when he comes before Boris in the last act . STO
* Once he has been identified , however , a new melody is used to accompany his _RARE_ , a bleak _RARE_ with barren _RARE_ creating a rather ancient effect : An imaginative _RARE_ , Pimen takes on the character he describes , as if he were _RARE_ the old _RARE_ blindness and _RARE_ cure . STO
* Here the composer uses a favorite device of his , the intensification of the mood through key relationships . STO
* The original D minor seems to _RARE_ blindness , _RARE_ in spite of all attempts to move away from it . STO
* As the child addresses the _RARE_ in a dream , light -- in the form of the major mode -- begins to appear , and at the moment of the _RARE_ we hear a clear and shining D major . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ always appear together and often sing together , in a _RARE_ , _RARE_ vigorous _RARE_ that _RARE_ them from the more subtle and _RARE_ Pimen . STO
* Their begging song might easily be a folk melody : The same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene . STO
* Apparently their origin is humble , their approach to life direct and _RARE_ . STO
* Whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't _RARE_ them now . STO
* _RARE_ is the straight man , not very _RARE_ , _RARE_ when he does speak . STO
* _RARE_ is loud , _RARE_ , _RARE_ in his _RARE_ and impatient with anyone who is not the same . STO
* A rough _RARE_ figure , heard first in the introduction to the _RARE_ scene , _RARE_ him _RARE_ and _RARE_ whenever he comes into the action : The _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , in which this figure becomes a _RARE_ accompaniment , _RARE_ in the picture of _RARE_ high spirits . STO
* The _RARE_ is irregular , and the abrupt key changes have a primitive _RARE_ . STO
* ( We can imagine how they startled _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* ) _RARE_ music begins to _RARE_ as he feels the effects of the wine , but he pulls himself together when the need arises . STO
* Both _RARE_ respond to the _RARE_ challenge with a few phrases of their begging song ; ; a _RARE_ _RARE_ touch is _RARE_ _RARE_ reading of the warrant . STO
* As the _RARE_ gradually comes back to him , his rhythm becomes _RARE_ , with the rigid _RARE_ of an _RARE_ reader . STO
* For the only time in the opera , words are not set according to their natural _RARE_ ; ; to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ , Rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as _RARE_ . STO
* His music shows a _RARE_ coupled with an _RARE_ quality that suggest somehow a _RARE_ with _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* His speech shows none of the native _RARE_ of the Russian characters ; ; in spite of the Italian name , he sounds French . STO
* His personality appears more striking by contrast with Marina , who is -- perhaps _RARE_ -- rather _RARE_ characterized . STO
* _RARE_ first entrance is a musical shock , a sudden open fifth in a key totally _RARE_ to what has preceded it . STO
* The effect is as if he had _RARE_ out of nowhere . STO
* He speaks quietly , _RARE_ his authority beneath a smooth _RARE_ , just as the shifting _RARE_ that accompany him all but hide the firm _RARE_ point beneath them . STO
* He addresses Marina with great _RARE_ , calling her `` _RARE_ '' at first ; ; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name , placing himself by implication in the position of a _RARE_ father . STO
* _RARE_ , this scene is a close parallel to one that _RARE_ was writing at the same time , the scene between _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Rangoni and _RARE_ have the same purpose -- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her _RARE_ cause -- and their _RARE_ are much the same . STO
* Rangoni begins by _RARE_ the sad state of the Church ; ; this brings a reaction of _RARE_ from Marina . STO
* The music becomes _RARE_ as he calls up a vision of her own _RARE_ : it is she , he tells her , who can bring the truth to Russia and convert the _RARE_ . STO
* As if in a _RARE_ , she _RARE_ his words -- then _RARE_ , with a shock , her own _RARE_ . STO
* This is no assignment for a frivolous girl , she _RARE_ him . STO
* Now Rangoni comes to the point , and we hear , for the first time , a long , downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic _RARE_ of his sinister power . STO
* It is a phrase as _RARE_ as a _RARE_ gesture , with a _RARE_ turn of harmony giving an effect of _RARE_ . STO
* Another theme , _RARE_ chromatic , appears as he _RARE_ her to gain power over _RARE_ by any means , even at the cost of her honor . STO
* _RARE_ from a _RARE_ , the music sounds as odd as the advice : Marina _RARE_ at this suggestion . STO
* Her pride is as much at stake as her virtue ; ; she is the _RARE_ beauty , the _RARE_ who turns away _RARE_ by the dozen . STO
* _RARE_ she _RARE_ Rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her . STO
* At once the _RARE_ pulls out all the _RARE_ . STO
* To music of a _RARE_ darkness , he describes the powers of _RARE_ gaining control of the girl , _RARE_ her soul with pride and _RARE_ her beauty . STO
* The combined threat of _RARE_ and _RARE_ is too much for her , and she falls _RARE_ at his feet . STO
* With another sudden change of mood , he is again calm and _RARE_ , _RARE_ her to trust and _RARE_ him as God's _RARE_ -- and the chromatic scale _RARE_ in ominous contradiction . STO
* Whatever the source of _RARE_ power , Marina is his _RARE_ now ; ; we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene , when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love _RARE_ , again throwing a chill over the atmosphere . STO
* The most unusual feature of Boris , however , is the use of the greatest character of all , the chorus . STO
* This is the real _RARE_ of the drama ; ; the conflict is not Boris versus _RARE_ or _RARE_ or even the ghost of the murdered child , but Boris versus the Russian people . STO
* Mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent to which _RARE_ scenes _RARE_ the action . STO
* _RARE_ first entrance seems almost a _RARE_ to the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , with its _RARE_ confusion of _RARE_ . STO
* We have a brief glimpse of the _RARE_ public personality , the `` official Boris '' , but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd -- a significant contrast with its _RARE_ _RARE_ in the opening scene , its bitter resentment and fury in the final act . STO
* One reason for the unique _RARE_ of the chorus is its great variety in expression . STO
* It rarely speaks as a unit . STO
* Even in its most conventional appearance , the _RARE_ song of _RARE_ to Marina , there are a few female _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ for her _RARE_ . STO
* In many passages -- for example , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ -- each section of the chorus becomes a character group with a particular opinion . STO
* _RARE_ arguments arise between _RARE_ and _RARE_ , who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea . STO
* The opening scene shows this method at its most individual . STO
* Mussorgsky _RARE_ a telling picture of the common people , those who must suffer the effects of their _RARE_ struggle for power without understanding the causes . STO
* They are held in control by force , but barely . STO
* They will _RARE_ and _RARE_ for _RARE_ leadership in a _RARE_ intense song , its phrases _RARE_ broken as if gasping for breath , but when the police with their _RARE_ move away , they mock and _RARE_ and fight among themselves . STO
* There is a quick change from the _RARE_ song to a _RARE_ tone . STO
* `` Hey , Mityukh '' , asks one group , `` what are we shouting about '' ? STO
* And Mityukh , apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd , replies that he has no notion . STO
* The jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return ; ; then the people strike up their song with even more _RARE_ than before , ending it with a _RARE_ of despair . STO
* Mussorgsky frequently uses _RARE_ music with considerable dramatic force . STO
* In _RARE_ cell the soft _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , heard from _RARE_ , not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young _RARE_ thoughts and his situation . STO
* This is especially striking between _RARE_ quiet exit and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ against Boris . STO
* Again , as Boris feels himself nearing death , a _RARE_ files into the hall singing a _RARE_ , its _RARE_ _RARE_ adding a _RARE_ touch to the grim atmosphere : The words are hardly calculated to put the _RARE_ mind at ease . STO
* They echo the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ for mercy -- and there is no mercy '' . STO
* The living as well as the dead now accuse him ; ; this final _RARE_ of his guilt is the _RARE_ one . STO
* One of the outstanding assets of the present production is the restoration of the St. _RARE_ scene , usually omitted from performances and rarely included in a published score . STO
* Though brief , it has a sharp dramatic edge and great _RARE_ . STO
* In addition , it is an important link in the plot , giving us a revealing glimpse of the _RARE_ attitude toward Boris and the false _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ in the forest of _RARE_ is a natural _RARE_ . STO
* The St. _RARE_ scene opens with little groups of _RARE_ milling around the square , the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny . STO
* In the orchestra we hear first a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ figure , then the insistent `` police '' _RARE_ as it appeared in the opening scene . STO
* The service is over , and a number of people come from the church with their _RARE_ Mityukh in the lead . STO
* They bring the news that the _RARE_ has been _RARE_ ; ; this is met with _RARE_ by the _RARE_ , who claim that Mityukh is lying or drunk . STO
* ( Mussorgsky _RARE_ contrasts the two groups by their _RARE_ accompaniment , solemn _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* ) There is still more news , Mityukh _RARE_ : they have prayed for the soul of the _RARE_ . STO
* So far these remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have _RARE_ assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a _RARE_ at a single stage of development . STO
* For critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max _RARE_ period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic _RARE_ . STO
* This seems odd when one _RARE_ that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` _RARE_ '' is dated `` between _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' ; ; `` Seeing The _RARE_ _RARE_ '' is dated August , _RARE_ . STO
* One might expect that in a poetic career of _RARE_ years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . STO
* This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . STO
* In a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of _RARE_ flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost _RARE_ consistency . STO
* Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the _RARE_ of his _RARE_ ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to _RARE_ , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' _RARE_ entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not _RARE_ us : it only _RARE_ us '' ( Early Life , p. _RARE_ ) . STO
* And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the _RARE_ did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one . STO
* There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy's development : he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his . STO
* There is only one Hardy style , but in the earlier poems that style is only _RARE_ evident , and when it is not , the style is the style of another poet , or of the fashion of the time . STO
* In the later poems , however , the personal tone _RARE_ . STO
* The bad early poems are bad _RARE_ or bad _RARE_ ; ; the bad late poems are bad Hardy . STO
* There are two ways of getting at a _RARE_ development : through his dated poems , and through the _RARE_ which he made in later editions of his work . STO
* About a quarter of Hardy's poems carry an _RARE_ date line , usually the year of completion , but sometimes _RARE_ years ( `` _RARE_ - 1910 '' ) or two separate dates when Hardy worked on the poem ( `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' ) or an approximate date ( `` During the War '' ) . STO
* These dates are virtually the only clues we have to the _RARE_ of the poems , since the separate volumes are neither _RARE_ within themselves nor in relation to each other . STO
* With the exception of _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , each volume contains dated poems ranging over several decades ( _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ sixty-one years ) ; ; the internal organization rarely has any _RARE_ order , except in obvious groups like the `` Poems of _RARE_ '' , the `` Poems of 1912 - 13 '' , and the war poems . STO
* From the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy's career in poetry , always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative . STO
* The dated poems suggest that while Hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant , his production was not . STO
* He had two productive periods , one in the late _RARE_ , the other in the decade from 1910 to _RARE_ ( half of the dated poems are from the latter period , and these alone total about _RARE_ of all Hardy's poems ) . STO
* There was one _RARE_ period : only one poem is dated between _RARE_ and _RARE_ and , except for the poems written on the trip to Italy in _RARE_ , very few from _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* The dated poems also give us an idea of the degree to which Hardy drew upon past _RARE_ for his various volumes , and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time . STO
* Poems Of The _RARE_ And The Present and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , both published while Hardy was at work on The _RARE_ , draw heavily on poems written before 1900 . STO
* _RARE_ Of _RARE_ and _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , coming during his most productive decade , are relatively _RARE_ ; ; the former contains no poem dated before _RARE_ - 10 -- that is , no poem from a period covered by a previous volume -- and the latter has only a few such . STO
* The last three volumes are again more dependent on the past , as Hardy's creative powers _RARE_ in his old age . STO
* These observations about Hardy's productivity _RARE_ with the details of his life as we know them . STO
* The first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a _RARE_ , before he had decided to write _RARE_ for a living ( in his note for Who's Who he wrote that he `` wrote _RARE_ _RARE_ - _RARE_ ; ; gave up verse for _RARE_ , _RARE_ - 70 ; ; but resumed it later '' ) . STO
* During the _RARE_ _RARE_ years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was , in addition , _RARE_ with bad health ( he spent six months in bed in _RARE_ , too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at A _RARE_ ) . STO
* Two entries in The Early Life support the assumption that during this period Hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry . STO
* Mrs. Hardy records that `` at the end of November ( _RARE_ ) he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible '' ( Early Life , p. _RARE_ ) ; ; and on Christmas Day , _RARE_ , Hardy wrote : `` While thinking of _RARE_ ' the _RARE_ _RARE_ Of _RARE_ before dawn this morning , new _RARE_ seemed to open , and worrying _RARE_ to disappear '' ( Early Life , p. _RARE_ ) . STO
* There are more poems dated in the _RARE_ than in the _RARE_ -- Hardy had apparently resumed the _RARE_ wings as he decreased the volume of his _RARE_ -- but none in _RARE_ , the year of _RARE_ , and only one in 1895 , the year of _RARE_ . STO
* After 1895 the number increases , and in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no dated poem -- _RARE_ , when Hardy was at work on The _RARE_ . STO
* The second productive period , the decade from 1910 to _RARE_ , can be related to three events : the completion of The _RARE_ in _RARE_ , which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years ; ; the death of Emma Hardy in 1912 , which had a profound emotional effect on Hardy for which he found release in poetry ; ; and the First World War . STO
* It may seem strange that a poet should come to full _RARE_ in his _RARE_ , but we have it on Hardy's own authority that `` he was a child till he was sixteen , a youth till he was _RARE_ , and a young man till he was nearly fifty '' ( Early Life , p. 42 ) . STO
* We may carry this sequence one step further and say that at _RARE_ he was a poet at the height of his powers , wanting only the _RARE_ of two _RARE_ , one personal , the other national , to loose those powers in poetry . STO
* Hardy's two productive decades were separated by forty years , yet between them he developed only in that he became more steadily himself -- it was a _RARE_ , not an expanding process . STO
* Like a wise _RARE_ , Hardy _RARE_ away the _RARE_ _RARE_ and songs , and the elements of _RARE_ and poetic _RARE_ to which his personal style was not suited , and let the main stock of his talent _RARE_ . STO
* The range of the later poetry is considerably _RARE_ , but the number of successful poems is far greater . STO
* We can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities : `` _RARE_ '' ( _RARE_ ) and `` Neutral Tones '' ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* There is not much to be said for `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* Like about half of the _RARE_ - 70 poems , it is a _RARE_ on a conventional theme -- the unhappiness of love . STO
* Almost anyone could have written it ; ; it is competent in the sense that it makes a _RARE_ statement without _RARE_ the rules of the _RARE_ form , but it is entirely _RARE_ and entirely unlike Hardy . STO
* The language is the conventional language of the form ; ; there is no phrase or image that sounds like Hardy or that is striking enough to give _RARE_ to the poem . STO
* It is _RARE_ than Hardy usually is , but with the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* It is obviously a young man's poem , written out of books and not out of experience ; ; it _RARE_ emotion without _RARE_ it -- that is to say , it is sentimental . STO
* There are many such _RARE_ anonymous performances among the earlier poems . STO
* `` Neutral Tones '' we immediately recognize as a fine poem in Hardy's most characteristic style : the plain but not quite _RARE_ language , the hard , particular , _RARE_ images , the slightly odd _RARE_ , the dramatic handling of the occasion , the refusal to resolve the issue -- all these we have seen in Hardy's best poems . STO
* The poem does not _RARE_ the _RARE_ of ordinary speech nor draw on _RARE_ sources of _RARE_ , yet it is obviously not ordinary speech -- only Hardy would say `` a grin of bitterness swept thereby ; ; like an ominous bird _RARE_ '' , or `` _RARE_ with wrong '' , or would describe a winter sun as `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* The details of the setting of `` Neutral Tones '' are not , strictly speaking , _RARE_ , but they _RARE_ to create a mood which is appropriate both to a _RARE_ winter day and to the end of love , and in this way love and weather , the emotions and the elements , _RARE_ each other in a way that is common to many of Hardy's best poems ( `` _RARE_ '' , `` The _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , and `` During _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' , for example ) and to some moving passages in the novels as well ( Far From The _RARE_ _RARE_ is full of scenes constructed in this way ) . STO
* `` Neutral Tones '' is an excellent example of Hardy's mature style , drawn from his earliest productive period ; ; I _RARE_ it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older ( as _RARE_ did ) , but that he simply learned to use better what he already had . STO
* In the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world ; ; if it is _RARE_ , it is also precise , and the precision _RARE_ authority to the vision . STO
* In `` _RARE_ '' , on the other hand , the _RARE_ is a case not _RARE_ ; ; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the _RARE_ right to speak as he does . STO
* In the _RARE_ - 70 decade there are many poems like `` _RARE_ '' , but there is only one `` Neutral Tones '' . STO
* Hardy was not Hardy very often . STO
* The `` Poems of 1912 - 13 '' offer a good example of Hardy's style as it was _RARE_ in the later productive decade . STO
* These are the poems Hardy wrote after the death of his first wife ; ; they _RARE_ a painful _RARE_ to what might have been , to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness , and ended in long years of suffering and hatred . STO
* Hardy obviously felt that these poems were _RARE_ personal and private ; ; he sometimes called them `` an _RARE_ '' , and he would not allow them to be published in _RARE_ . STO
* They are the only poems that he _RARE_ as a group between their first appearance ( in _RARE_ Of _RARE_ ) and the publication of the _RARE_ Poems . STO
* The _RARE_ tone is Hardy's natural tone of voice , and it is not surprising that the 1912 - 13 poems are consistently and _RARE_ his . STO
* The view is always toward the past ; ; but the mood is not quite _RARE_ -- Hardy would not allow sentiment to _RARE_ his sense of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the past , and the eternal _RARE_ of the dead . STO
* The poems are , the _RARE_ tells us , the `` _RARE_ of an ancient flame '' ; ; the fire of love is dead , and Hardy stands , as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence , over the _RARE_ circle of _RARE_ sticks , and thinks of past happiness and present grief , honest and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ invisible , modern _RARE_ , like _RARE_ and _RARE_ , is perceived only by its effects at more _RARE_ social levels , where it is called _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , by the way , is the term used by the _RARE_ and poet , Lawrence _RARE_ , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as _RARE_ : `` We _RARE_ . STO
* '' -- John L. Lewis . STO
* Like the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , like two ruined _RARE_ guarding the entrance to one of _RARE_ circles , stand two great dead _RARE_ _RARE_ -- the _RARE_ of the post-war generation : the great _RARE_ , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas . STO
* If the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves . STO
* Both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely _RARE_ art . STO
* Both of them were my friends . STO
* _RARE_ in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by _RARE_ or fatigue . STO
* So as the years passed , I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal _RARE_ . STO
* The last time I saw _RARE_ , at _RARE_ Bob City , he was so gone -- so blind to the world -- that he literally sat down on me before he realized I was there . STO
* `` What happened , man '' ? STO
* I said , referring to the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , man , evil '' , he said , and that's all he said for the rest of the night . STO
* About dawn he got up to blow . STO
* The _RARE_ crowd _RARE_ into stillness and the _RARE_ melody _RARE_ through it . STO
* The last time I saw Dylan , his _RARE_ had not just passed the limits of _RARE_ . STO
* It had assumed the terrifying _RARE_ of _RARE_ matter . STO
* Being with him was like being swept away by a _RARE_ of falling _RARE_ . STO
* Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common than the same _RARE_ end . STO
* As artists , they were very similar . STO
* They were both very _RARE_ . STO
* But this _RARE_ , enchanting _RARE_ had , compared with important artists of the past , relatively little content . STO
* Neither of them got very far beyond a sort of _RARE_ _RARE_ at his own _RARE_ . STO
* The principal theme of Thomas's poetry was the _RARE_ of birth and death -- the pain of _RARE_ creation . STO
* Music , of course , is not so explicit an art , but anybody who knew Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift . STO
* Both of them did communicate one central theme : _RARE_ the ruin of the world , there is only one defense -- the creative act . STO
* This , of course , is the theme of much art -- perhaps most poetry . STO
* It is the theme of _RARE_ , who certainly otherwise bears little _RARE_ to Parker or Thomas . STO
* The difference is that _RARE_ accepted his theme with a kind of _RARE_ assurance . STO
* To Dylan and _RARE_ it was an agony and terror . STO
* I do not believe that this is due to anything especially _RARE_ about their relationship to their own _RARE_ . STO
* I believe rather that it is due to the _RARE_ world in which that _RARE_ seemed to be the sole value . STO
* _RARE_ column of _RARE_ verse _RARE_ quietly enough in the _RARE_ air of _RARE_ Rome . STO
* Art may have been for him the most _RARE_ , orderly , and noble activity of man . STO
* But the other activities of his life _RARE_ of these values . STO
* They did not actively _RARE_ them . STO
* Dylan Thomas's verse had to find _RARE_ in a world of burning cities and burning Jews . STO
* He was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air _RARE_ and gas _RARE_ . STO
* As the world began to take on the _RARE_ of an immense air _RARE_ or gas _RARE_ , I believe his art became meaningless to him . STO
* I think all this could apply to Parker just as well , although , because of the nature of music , it is not _RARE_ -- at least not conclusively . STO
* Thomas and Parker have more in common than theme , attitude , life pattern . STO
* In the practice of their art , there is an obvious technical _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ to popular belief , they were not great technical _RARE_ . STO
* Their effects are only _RARE_ startling . STO
* Thomas is a regression from the technical originality and _RARE_ of writers like Pierre _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* Similarly , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , and of Parker particularly , have been vastly _RARE_ by people unfamiliar with music , especially by that _RARE_ , the intellectual _RARE_ , the jazz _RARE_ . STO
* The tonal _RARE_ consist in the introduction of a few _RARE_ used in classical music for centuries . STO
* And there is less _RARE_ difference between progressive jazz , no matter how progressive , and _RARE_ , than there is between two movements of many conventional _RARE_ . STO
* What Parker and his _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , Davis , _RARE_ , _RARE_ ( _RARE_ is an _RARE_ ) , etc. -- did was to absorb the musical _RARE_ of the older jazz into the basic structure , of which it then became an integral part , and with which it then developed . STO
* This is true of the _RARE_ line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody -- _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It is true of the _RARE_ pattern in which the beat shifts continuously , or at least is continuously sprung , so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long _RARE_ of the phrase or _RARE_ . STO
* This is exactly what happened in the transition from _RARE_ to _RARE_ music . STO
* It is the difference between _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* It is not a _RARE_ _RARE_ to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry . STO
* The special _RARE_ effects of a _RARE_ or an _RARE_ _RARE_ -- actually _RARE_ -- become the main concern . STO
* The metaphysical _RARE_ , which _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ still dominant in _RARE_ American colleges , were _RARE_ . STO
* Thomas's _RARE_ and _RARE_ are ends in themselves . STO
* The immediate theme , if it exists , is _RARE_ , and his main theme -- the terror of birth -- is simply _RARE_ . STO
* This is one difference between _RARE_ and Dylan which should be pointed out . STO
* Again , contrary to popular belief , there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either _RARE_ or emotionally . STO
* His _RARE_ melody is a sort of naive _RARE_ of all experience . STO
* _RARE_ it does not _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ ; ; it _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This is true also of a painter like Jackson Pollock . STO
* He may have been _RARE_ in his behavior , but his paintings are as _RARE_ as _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication . STO
* The insistent _RARE_ of the general environment _RARE_ into even the most _RARE_ poetry . STO
* It is much more a personal difference . STO
* Thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and _RARE_ of the world . STO
* Parker and Pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world . STO
* _RARE_ pure and simple , _RARE_ , is not of major importance , but it is interesting that Parker , following Lester Young , was one of the leaders of the so-called _RARE_ revolution . STO
* In modern jazz , the _RARE_ is treated as a _RARE_ and played with conventional _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , Thomas's verse was extremely conventional , as was , _RARE_ , the verse of that other tragic _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I want to make clear what I consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts . STO
* _RARE_ is _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of structure . STO
* A poem by Dylan Thomas , a _RARE_ _RARE_ by Charles Parker , a painting by Jackson Pollock -- these are pure _RARE_ as ends in themselves . STO
* _RARE_ has come to determine structure . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ should be distinguished from its exact opposite -- the _RARE_ , _RARE_ invention of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , or present _RARE_ of poetic _RARE_ . STO
* Just as _RARE_ _RARE_ had little influence on anyone except very reactionary writers -- like _RARE_ _RARE_ , for instance , to whom _RARE_ was the last word in modern poetry and the _RARE_ of an _RARE_ , let alone a Paul _RARE_ were _RARE_ -- so Dylan Thomas's influence has been slight indeed . STO
* In fact , his only _RARE_ -- the only person to _RARE_ his style -- was W. S. _RARE_ , who seems to have _RARE_ him without much understanding , and who has since moved on to other methods . STO
* Thomas's principal influence lay in the communication of an attitude -- that of the now _RARE_ British romantic school of the New _RARE_ -- Henry _RARE_ , J. F. _RARE_ , and others -- all of whom were quite conventional poets . STO
* Parker certainly had much more of an influence . STO
* At one time it was the ambition of every _RARE_ player in every high school band in America to blow like _RARE_ . STO
* Even before his death this influence had begun to _RARE_ . STO
* In fact , the whole generation of the founding _RARE_ of _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Davis , _RARE_ , and the rest -- are just now at a considerable discount . STO
* The main line of development today goes back to Lester Young and _RARE_ them . STO
* The point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* There is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be _RARE_ from _RARE_ to _RARE_ , or for that matter , from _RARE_ through Henry James to Gertrude _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ generation before World War 1 , , and , on a lower level , the _RARE_ of the period between the wars , both assumed an accepted universe of _RARE_ , in which , to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , it was possible to make definite advances , exactly as in the sciences . STO
* I doubt if anyone holds such ideas today . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , but like the _RARE_ music developed from Lester Young , it is a continuity sustained by popular demand . STO
* In the plastic arts , a very similar situation exists . STO
* _RARE_ like Hans _RARE_ and Max _RARE_ might talk of creation by _RARE_ -- of _RARE_ pictures by walking on them with painted soles , or by _RARE_ bits of paper up in the air . STO
* But it is obvious that they were _RARE_ . STO
* Nothing looks anything like an _RARE_ or an _RARE_ but another _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* Nothing looks less like their work than the _RARE_ of random occasion . STO
* Many of the _RARE_ War 2 , abstract _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the discipline of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , look alike , and do look like _RARE_ . STO
* The aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist , but it is a very _RARE_ appeal . STO
* Once again what has happened is an _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of painting . STO
* It is curious that at its best , the work of this school of painting -- Mark _RARE_ , Jackson Pollock , _RARE_ Still , Robert _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the rest -- _RARE_ nothing so much as the passage painting of quite _RARE_ painters : the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the background of a Henry _RARE_ , itself a formula derived from _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ of light and black which _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Often work of this sort is presented as _RARE_ -- the pure _RARE_ of the brush stroke seeking only absolute _RARE_ values . STO
* You have only to compare such painting with the work of , say , _RARE_ , to realize that someone is using words and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* At its best the abstract _RARE_ achieve a simple _RARE_ _RARE_ surface . STO
* Its poverty shows up immediately when compared with _RARE_ , where the _RARE_ rises to painting of extraordinary _RARE_ and power . STO
* A _RARE_ painting , however _RARE_ , is a universe of _RARE_ in vast depths . STO
* A Pollock is an object of art -- _RARE_ -- _RARE_ only by its great size . STO
* In fact , once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall , it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper . STO
* Now there is nothing wrong with complicated wallpaper . STO
* There is just more to _RARE_ . STO
* The great _RARE_ brush painters painted _RARE_ , too -- at least portable ones , screens . STO
* A process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long . STO
* So , in the last couple of years , abstract _RARE_ has tended toward romantic suggestion -- indications of landscape or living figures . STO
* Anglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the _RARE_ of verse in the heroic age . STO
* _RARE_ court _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ at _RARE_ ( lines _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) , and _RARE_ the tale of _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ comparison of the _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ ( lines _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) ; ; _RARE_ court _RARE_ _RARE_ of the discovered _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( Odyssey 8 _RARE_ ) , and takes up a tale of _RARE_ while the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ on ( Odyssey 8 _RARE_ ) . STO
* Nothing in all this is _RARE_ : unlike the poets of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , _RARE_ blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Since none of these _RARE_ of _RARE_ without writing is intended to _RARE_ a _RARE_ into the epic matter , there is _RARE_ evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . STO
* That such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ the observation that the _RARE_ Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to _RARE_ that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete _RARE_ of Greek epic survived ; ; he further _RARE_ that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely _RARE_ that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas . STO
* _RARE_ from _RARE_ conclusions and _RARE_ one of his _RARE_ , _RARE_ P. _RARE_ , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a _RARE_ of oral formulas inherited and extended by _RARE_ of _RARE_ generations , and the _RARE_ is striking and _RARE_ . STO
* Yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial _RARE_ : Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very _RARE_ oral poet , but it appears safe to assume that no sustained _RARE_ in _RARE_ could be composed without extreme difficulty , even in a language of many terminal _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ seems nearly as severe a curb , although in a _RARE_ passage William of _RARE_ _RARE_ that A _RARE_ Of _RARE_ was _RARE_ before the battle _RARE_ at _RARE_ . STO
* The Anglo-Saxon _RARE_ line and the Homeric _RARE_ probably imposed less of a _RARE_ ; ; the verse of Beowulf or of The Iliad and The Odyssey was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents _RARE_ in _RARE_ a _RARE_ . STO
* Yet certain aids were valuable and quite _RARE_ necessary for _RARE_ long _RARE_ of verse without a pause . STO
* The poet in a written tradition who generally never _RARE_ a line may once in a while pause and _RARE_ without _RARE_ blame . STO
* But the oral poet cannot pause ; ; he must _RARE_ continuously with no apparent effort . STO
* Even though the _RARE_ of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage , it is still great enough for him often to be seriously _RARE_ unless he has aids to _RARE_ rapid composition . STO
* The _RARE_ poet had such aids in the kennings , which provided for the difficulties of _RARE_ ; ; the Homeric poet had epithets , which provided for _RARE_ needs in the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he _RARE_ out his lines , because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous _RARE_ for the chief common and proper _RARE_ . STO
* Other _RARE_ could of course serve the same function , and for the sake of ease I shall speak of kennings and epithets in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ possible sense , and name , for example , _RARE_ a _RARE_ for the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ elements too _RARE_ in each epic _RARE_ , but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large _RARE_ and _RARE_ supply of semantic _RARE_ , and to _RARE_ the members of any system of _RARE_ as basic formulas of the poetic language . STO
* _RARE_ to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon as in the other _RARE_ _RARE_ , we cannot say how frequently the kennings in Beowulf _RARE_ in contemporary epic on the same soil . STO
* But we can say that since a writing poet , with _RARE_ before him , would seem unlikely to _RARE_ a technique based upon frequent and substantial _RARE_ , the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be _RARE_ to an oral tradition . STO
* One of the greatest _RARE_ of our time , Frederick M. _RARE_ , argues that when it is assumed The Iliad and The Odyssey are oral poems , the _RARE_ single _RARE_ called _RARE_ cannot be either credited with or denied originality in choice of _RARE_ . STO
* Any example of grand or _RARE_ _RARE_ may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous _RARE_ into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown _RARE_ . STO
* The quest of the historical _RARE_ is likely never to have further success ; ; no individual word in The Iliad or The Odyssey can be credited to any one man ; ; no strikingly effective element of speech in the _RARE_ poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the _RARE_ epic _RARE_ that may have existed at the beginning of the first _RARE_ before Christ . STO
* This observation is of interest not only to students of Homeric poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well . STO
* To the extent that a tale is twice told , its final author must be suspect , although _RARE_ in an oral tradition is less a _RARE_ than the standard _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ argues further , and here he makes his main point , that once The Iliad and The Odyssey are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry , Homeric critics are deprived of an entire _RARE_ they previously found _RARE_ . STO
* With a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions , no expression can be deemed _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ for its context , because each was very probably the only expression that _RARE_ practice and ease of rapid _RARE_ would allow . STO
* _RARE_ or phrases that _RARE_ have admired as handsome or _RARE_ or _RARE_ must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable _RARE_ , sometimes accurate and sometimes not . STO
* This observation too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry . STO
* To the extent that a language is formulaic , its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other _RARE_ . STO
* W. F. _RARE_ suggests that certain kennings in Beowulf were selected sometimes for _RARE_ and sometimes for _RARE_ _RARE_ , but such a view would appear _RARE_ unless it is denied that the language of Beowulf is formulaic . STO
* If the master of _RARE_ who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional , he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards _RARE_ and sophisticated _RARE_ of speech elements . STO
* Once many significant phrases are found in theory or in _RARE_ practice to provide for _RARE_ necessity , they are not to be _RARE_ for their semantic properties in isolated _RARE_ . STO
* It is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of Beowulf such effects as intentional irony . STO
* Yet , if the argument is turned _RARE_ , there may be found a great deal in _RARE_ view , after all . STO
* A formulaic element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection . STO
* _RARE_ , though the _RARE_ expressions are , they may nevertheless be handsome or _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* A long _RARE_ in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things , and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually accurate . STO
* _RARE_ , we do not know how they were regarded in their day , but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more _RARE_ to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read _RARE_ or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to _RARE_ in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ in a written tradition are chosen for the _RARE_ ; ; in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic _RARE_ , and tend towards _RARE_ rather than _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ is therefore not to be placed upon the _RARE_ _RARE_ in an oral poem ; ; _RARE_ today would hope to discover the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ or the palace of _RARE_ . STO
* A ship at _RARE_ could be called a _RARE_ _RARE_ in Anglo-Saxon or a swift ship in Greek . STO
* Even when _RARE_ of weapons the _RARE_ would be _RARE_ ( as their king is _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ would be _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , like _RARE_ in The _RARE_ , is potentially the _RARE_ of men and may accordingly be called _RARE_ even when he stands idle . STO
* In _RARE_ the _RARE_ of _RARE_ is used deliberately and _RARE_ , but the Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and recall to the _RARE_ `` a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the _RARE_ '' . STO
* The epic language was not entirely the _RARE_ of the poet ; ; it was partly his master . STO
* The _RARE_ intentions are difficult to _RARE_ and , except to _RARE_ , unimportant ; ; the language , however , is a proper object of scrutiny , and the effects of the language are _RARE_ even if sometimes inevitable . STO
* Beowulf and the Homeric poems appear oral compositions . STO
* Yet they are written ; ; at some stage in their _RARE_ they were _RARE_ . STO
* Albert B. Lord suggests that the Homeric poems were _RARE_ to a _RARE_ by a _RARE_ who held in his mind the poems fully _RARE_ but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his _RARE_ , and _RARE_ argues that the Beowulf poet and _RARE_ may have _RARE_ their verse in the same fashion . STO
* This explanation is attractive , but is _RARE_ at least in part by the observation that _RARE_ , though he used kennings in the traditional manner , was a _RARE_ man who four times inscribed his name by _RARE_ into his works . STO
* If _RARE_ was _RARE_ , the Beowulf poet may have been also , and so may the final _RARE_ of The Iliad and The Odyssey . STO
* In _RARE_ of the _RARE_ to the blind or _RARE_ _RARE_ , one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry _RARE_ , and became _RARE_ familiar with the established aids to _RARE_ , and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of the compositions of the past . STO
* Other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory : Beowulf may contain a design for terror , and The Iliad may have a vast _RARE_ pattern answering to a _RARE_ pattern produced during the Geometric _RARE_ in pottery . STO
* The account of the growth and final _RARE_ of these _RARE_ rests partly , however , upon the degree to which they were formulaic . STO
* Carl _RARE_ _RARE_ counted _RARE_ different lines repeated exactly in the two Homeric poems , and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight _RARE_ he counted _RARE_ different lines used a total of _RARE_ times . STO
* Thus one line in five from The Iliad and The Odyssey is to be found somewhere else in the two poems . STO
* The ratio is thoroughly remarkable , because the lines are so long -- half again as long as those of Beowulf . STO
* Anglo-Saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition ; ; there is no reason to think that the _RARE_ used and _RARE_ whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric _RARE_ . STO
* In determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle , however , to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their _RARE_ , for a stock of _RARE_ would be sufficient to permit the poet to _RARE_ with _RARE_ if they provided for _RARE_ needs . STO
* The _RARE_ scrutiny is owed to the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric epithets ; ; if any words or phrases are formulaic , they will be . STO
* The Iliad has two words for the shield , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and _RARE_ content , to show , as M. D. _RARE_ has said of Dickens generally , that much of the _RARE_ impact _RARE_ in its `` _RARE_ _RARE_ and moral _RARE_ '' . STO
* J. H. _RARE_ excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how _RARE_ that novel can be read from such a perspective . STO
* In his analysis , however , he _RARE_ upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a _RARE_ feature of the _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ _RARE_ to make that exploration . STO
* Dickens was not for nothing the most _RARE_ of the great _RARE_ writers . STO
* He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an _RARE_ hands are his most useful possession -- that in _RARE_ as in the theatre , gesture is an _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ character and _RARE_ action and response . STO
* It is hardly _RARE_ , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do _RARE_ or _RARE_ things with their hands . STO
* In Great Expectations the hands become almost an _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ his forefinger , a gesture which _RARE_ both contempt and the _RARE_ _RARE_ that half _RARE_ , half _RARE_ all who have _RARE_ with him . STO
* Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ hands , heavy as if her unhappiness were somehow concentrated in them , move in restless _RARE_ between her broken heart and her walking stick . STO
* _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' is the _RARE_ extended glad hand . STO
* _RARE_ reveals his _RARE_ by regularly rubbing his hands together . STO
* Old Mr. _RARE_ frantic response to life _RARE_ with a useless , _RARE_ wife is to `` put his two hands into his disturbed hair '' and `` make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it '' , whereas Joe _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ of Mrs. Joe by _RARE_ drawing `` the back of his hand across and across his nose '' . STO
* Such _RARE_ would be less worthy of remark , were it not that in Great Expectations , as in no other of _RARE_ novels , hands serve as a _RARE_ of plot and theme -- a kind of _RARE_ symbol or natural _RARE_ for the _RARE_ complex of human _RARE_ and the values and attitudes that _RARE_ them . STO
* Dickens not only reveals character through gesture , he makes hands a crucial element of the plot , a means of _RARE_ the structure of the novel by helping to define the _RARE_ relations with all the major characters , and a device for ordering such diverse _RARE_ as guilt , pursuit , crime , _RARE_ , education , _RARE_ , _RARE_ ( by both people and institutions ) , friendship , romantic love , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* We have only to think of Lady _RARE_ or the _RARE_ in Thomas _RARE_ famous story , `` The _RARE_ Of Mr. _RARE_ '' , to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment . STO
* So it is with Great Expectations , whether the hands be _RARE_ as he strikes down Mrs. _RARE_ or Pip's as he _RARE_ a pie from her _RARE_ . STO
* Such associations suit well with the _RARE_ or _RARE_ aspects of _RARE_ novel , but , on a deeper plane , they relate to the _RARE_ of sin , guilt , and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics . STO
* The novel opens with a _RARE_ _RARE_ frantically trying to avoid the _RARE_ of being `` laid hands on '' -- a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened eyes in the _RARE_ `` as if he were _RARE_ the hands of the dead people , stretching up _RARE_ out of their graves , to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ Pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a _RARE_ man who may `` softly creep his way to him and tear him open '' , `` _RARE_ his hands '' in him . STO
* As Pip _RARE_ over the theft that his own hands have committed , his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local _RARE_ , _RARE_ it into `` a _RARE_ devoting me to the _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ down in the _RARE_ , Pip _RARE_ in terror `` with both hands '' to his _RARE_ ; ; later he _RARE_ in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who _RARE_ holds out a pair of _RARE_ which he has brought to _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* Through such details Dickens indicates at the _RARE_ that guilt is a part of the _RARE_ bond between Pip and _RARE_ which is so _RARE_ to alter both their lives . STO
* Since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into _RARE_ , hands naturally represent action , and since nearly half the characters in Great Expectations are of the _RARE_ or closely allied to it , the _RARE_ of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at . STO
* Dickens , for excellent psychological reasons , never fully reveals _RARE_ _RARE_ past , but Pip , at the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in London , _RARE_ from _RARE_ a hand which he fears `` might be stained with blood '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ about the _RARE_ `` like _RARE_ '' with `` his hands in his pockets '' , and when he shouts _RARE_ at Mrs. Joe for _RARE_ to his holiday , she _RARE_ her hands in a _RARE_ , _RARE_ them `` upon her bosom and upon her knees '' , and _RARE_ them in her husband's hair . STO
* This last `` _RARE_ '' is only the _RARE_ to the vicious blow upon her head , `` dealt by some unknown hand '' whose identity is later revealed not _RARE_ but through a manual action -- the tracing of _RARE_ hammer upon a _RARE_ . STO
* Pip himself is to feel the terror of _RARE_ `` _RARE_ hand '' in his secret rendezvous at the _RARE_ on the _RARE_ . STO
* Dickens _RARE_ great emphasis on the hands in this scene . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ his hand at Pip , _RARE_ the table with his fist , draws his _RARE_ hand `` across his mouth as if his mouth _RARE_ '' for his victim , _RARE_ his hands hang `` loose and heavy at his sides '' , and Pip _RARE_ him so intensely that he knows `` of the slightest action of his fingers '' . STO
* _RARE_ might almost be _RARE_ _RARE_ man come alive , a figure of _RARE_ from Pip's _RARE_ of guilt . STO
* The _RARE_ , _RARE_ wrists of Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_ are the _RARE_ marks of her sinister past , for her master , _RARE_ exhibiting them to his dinner guests , makes a point of the `` force of grip there is in these hands '' . STO
* _RARE_ iron control over her ( `` she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him , _RARE_ , as if she _RARE_ his calling her back ) '' ) rests on his having once got her _RARE_ of a murder charge by _RARE_ _RARE_ her sleeves at the trial to _RARE_ her strength and by passing off the _RARE_ on the backs of her hands as the _RARE_ of _RARE_ rather than of human _RARE_ . STO
* It is the similarity between _RARE_ hands and _RARE_ ( `` The action of her fingers was like the action of _RARE_ '' ) that provides Pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and _RARE_ a symbolic connection between the _RARE_ of crime and the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ House . STO
* Finally , _RARE_ pursuit of _RARE_ , his _RARE_ and _RARE_ , begins by his holding him in a _RARE_ grip on the river _RARE_ to _RARE_ his escape and _RARE_ in his `` laying his hand on his _RARE_ to identify him '' , thus _RARE_ the _RARE_ struggle in the water during which _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ hand here _RARE_ becomes the agent of justice . STO
* But only in one of its aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , so important a theme elsewhere in Dickens , is here central , and hands are often associated in some way with the false values -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ -- that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of _RARE_ . STO
* Dickens suggests the economic _RARE_ of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of Pip's five little dead brothers `` who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle '' , who seemed to have `` all been born on their backs with their hands in their _RARE_ , and had never taken them out in this state of existence '' . STO
* Pip's great expectations , his progress through illusion and _RARE_ , turn , somewhat as they do for the naive hero of _RARE_ American _RARE_ , upon the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ through _RARE_ income -- what _RARE_ calls `` portable property '' and what _RARE_ _RARE_ Pip for letting `` slip through ( his ) fingers '' . STO
* Since a gentleman must , if possible , avoid _RARE_ them by work , his hands , as _RARE_ as his _RARE_ , become the index of social status . STO
* Almost the first step in the _RARE_ of Pip's values is the _RARE_ shame he feels when _RARE_ _RARE_ remarks the _RARE_ of his hands : `` They had never troubled me before , but they troubled me now , as _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* Pip _RARE_ how _RARE_ would look down upon _RARE_ hands , _RARE_ by work in the _RARE_ , and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his _RARE_ ones is made to _RARE_ the opposition of values between which Pip _RARE_ -- _RARE_ and work , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ and affection -- in fact , between _RARE_ House and the _RARE_ . STO
* When the _RARE_ that _RARE_ Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love , the _RARE_ is marked by an embarrassed _RARE_ at which Pip _RARE_ : `` No , don't wipe it off -- for God's sake , give me your _RARE_ hand '' ! STO
* Pip's _RARE_ _RARE_ of Miss _RARE_ , during which he _RARE_ to kiss her hand , _RARE_ his _RARE_ to a supposed _RARE_ who seems to be opening up for him a new world of _RARE_ ; ; when , on the journey to London that immediately follows , he _RARE_ _RARE_ to lay his hand upon the _RARE_ at the end of the village , the wooden _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ a spiritual _RARE_ between innocence and the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , one cannot miss the significance of this gesture , for Dickens _RARE_ it _RARE_ in Pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis -- his painful recognition , in a talk with Herbert _RARE_ , that his _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ is as _RARE_ as it is romantic . STO
* In both cases the _RARE_ represents Pip's _RARE_ awareness of contrary _RARE_ . STO
* A variety of hand movements helps _RARE_ the moral climate of the fallen world Pip _RARE_ beyond the _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ family upon Miss _RARE_ is _RARE_ up in the _RARE_ _RARE_ of Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ , who puts her hand to her throat in a _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ choking , then _RARE_ it `` upon her _RARE_ bosom '' with `` an _RARE_ _RARE_ of manner '' , and finally _RARE_ it to Miss _RARE_ in a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ own _RARE_ toward _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ hands throughout the novel serve to _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* We first see him shaking Mrs. _RARE_ hand on _RARE_ the _RARE_ amount of the _RARE_ paid to her husband for Pip's _RARE_ as an apprentice and later _RARE_ Pip's hands `` for the _RARE_ time at least '' ( `` May I -- may I -- '' ? STO
* ) in _RARE_ _RARE_ to Pip on his expectations . STO
* We take leave of _RARE_ as he _RARE_ over Pip's loss of fortune , extending his hand `` with a _RARE_ _RARE_ air '' and exhibiting `` the same fat five fingers '' , one of which he _RARE_ with `` the finger of Providence '' and _RARE_ at Pip in a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' and his own _RARE_ as Pip's `` earliest _RARE_ '' . STO
* Pip first learns `` the _RARE_ power of money '' from the _RARE_ _RARE_ , Mr. _RARE_ , whose brutality to his boy _RARE_ exactly matches the financial _RARE_ of each new customer , and whose _RARE_ hands touch `` the outside of each elbow '' and `` _RARE_ '' Pip out of the shop . STO
* The _RARE_ which money _RARE_ implies a different _RARE_ , and , upon taking up the life of a London gentleman , Pip must learn from Herbert _RARE_ that `` the _RARE_ is not generally used _RARE_ , but under '' . STO
* The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the _RARE_ of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record _RARE_ , inquiry _RARE_ , and _RARE_ switches . STO
* The declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . STO
* _RARE_ cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder _RARE_ sheet . STO
* When this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' may be used . STO
* Thus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder _RARE_ sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . STO
* The label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be _RARE_ in the operand column of the _RARE_ sheet . STO
* The operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the _RARE_ card or continuation cards but may end with the _RARE_ following any parameter . STO
* _RARE_ may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces . STO
* _RARE_ of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the examples _RARE_ the various statements . STO
* If a continuation card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards , the compiler will generate a _RARE_ and issue an error message . STO
* Additional restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with _RARE_ appear on page _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of index words and electronic switches The assignment of actual addresses to symbolic index word and electronic switch names occurs in _RARE_ 3 , of the Autocoder _RARE_ . STO
* The initial availability of index words and electronic switches is determined by a table which is included in the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This table originally indicates that index words 1 through _RARE_ and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for assignment to symbolic references ; ; index words _RARE_ through _RARE_ are not available . STO
* The initial setting of this table may be altered , however , as described in the _RARE_ Data _RARE_ System Bulletin `` IBM _RARE_ _RARE_ System : _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , form Aj . STO
* During the first pass of _RARE_ 3 , , references to the actual addresses of index words and electronic switches are collected and the availability table is _RARE_ . STO
* At the end of this pass , the table indicates which index words and electronic switches are not available for assignment to symbolic references . STO
* Both index words and electronic switches may have been made _RARE_ before the start of assignment in one of the following ways . STO
* 1 . STO
* The initial setting of the availability table indicated that the index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment . STO
* 2 . STO
* The one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify _RARE_ or as a parameter which is always an index word or electronic switch , e.g. , 3 . STO
* The one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an EQU statement , e.g. , When the index words or electronic switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements described above , the position or order of the statements within the program is not important ; ; any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch _RARE_ at the end of this pass . STO
* During the assignment pass of _RARE_ 3 , , index words and electronic switches are reserved as they are encountered during assignment . STO
* Index words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways . STO
* The first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches ; ; the third applies only to index words . STO
* 1 . STO
* During the assignment pass , each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic name of an index word or electronic switch . STO
* When such a reference is found , an actual address is assigned and the availability table is changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available for later assignment . STO
* 2 . STO
* If the one- or two-digit address of an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand of an _RARE_ or _RARE_ statement ( see page _RARE_ ) , the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved . STO
* 3 . STO
* If a statement has been assigned an address in the index word area by means of an actual label or by means of an origin statement which refers to an actual address , the corresponding index word will be reserved . STO
* These entries should normally appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each _RARE_ statement . STO
* Otherwise , symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words . STO
* ( This method does not apply to electronic switches . STO
* ) The preceding methods allow efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a _RARE_ or _RARE_ program , particularly when used in conjunction with the _RARE_ statement . STO
* _RARE_ caution should be used , however , to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic switch which may result from the assignment of more than one name or function to the same address . STO
* If the symbolic name or actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included in the operand of an _RARE_ or _RARE_ statement ( see page _RARE_ ) , the specified index word or electronic switch will again be made available , regardless of the method by which it was reserved . STO
* It will not , however , be used for symbolic assignment until all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for the first time . STO
* If , at any time during the assignment pass , the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment , the warning message `` No More Index _RARE_ _RARE_ '' will be placed in the object program _RARE_ , the table will be altered to show that index words 1 through _RARE_ are available , and the assignment will continue as before . STO
* If the compiler finds that there are no more electronic switches available for assignment , the warning message `` No More _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' will be placed in the object program _RARE_ , the table will be altered to show that electronic switches 1 through 30 are available , and assignment will continue as before . STO
* The resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names used , e.g. , through the proper use of the EQU , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ statements . STO
* As noted in Appendix C , index words _RARE_ through _RARE_ are never available for assignment to symbolic names by the compiler ; ; also , index words _RARE_ through _RARE_ may have been made _RARE_ for assignment . STO
* _RARE_ statements Autocoder declarative statements provide the _RARE_ with the necessary information to complete the _RARE_ operations properly . STO
* _RARE_ statements are never executed in the object program and should be separated from the program instruction area , placed preferably at its beginning or end . STO
* Otherwise , special care must be taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to _RARE_ something in a data area as an instruction . STO
* If the compiler does encounter such statements , a warning message will be issued . STO
* _RARE_ Autocoder includes the following declarative statements : DA ( Define _RARE_ ) , DC ( Define _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ ( Define _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ ( Define _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ ( Define Line ) , EQU ( _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ ( Define _RARE_ _RARE_ ) , DIOCS ( Define _RARE_ Control System ) , and DUF ( _RARE_ _RARE_ For Unit _RARE_ ) . STO
* DA , DC , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ require more than one entry . STO
* The DA statement is used to name and define the positions and length of fields within an area . STO
* The DC statement is used to name and enter constants into the object program . STO
* Since the _RARE_ and _RARE_ make use of record definition words ( _RARE_ ) to read , write , move , and otherwise examine blocks of storage , the DA and DC statements provide the _RARE_ of generating _RARE_ automatically . STO
* When so instructed , Autocoder will generate one or more _RARE_ and assign them _RARE_ locations immediately preceding the area with which they are to be associated . STO
* An _RARE_ will be of the form Af , where _RARE_ is the starting location of the area and _RARE_ is its ending location . STO
* These addresses are calculated automatically by the _RARE_ . STO
* In some cases , it may be more _RARE_ to assign locations to _RARE_ associated with DA and DC areas in some other part of storage , i.e. , not immediately preceding the DA or DC areas . STO
* The _RARE_ statement may be used for this purpose . STO
* The _RARE_ statement may also be used to generate an _RARE_ _RARE_ any area specified by the _RARE_ . STO
* As many as ten digital switches may be named and provided by the _RARE_ statement for consideration by the _RARE_ and logic _RARE_ . STO

* In the _RARE_ , oxidation ponds are used _RARE_ for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . STO
* The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a _RARE_ treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . STO
* Research at _RARE_ , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to _RARE_ mgl with loadings from 8 to _RARE_ lb . STO
* Since experience indicates that _RARE_ from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . STO
* Recent studies by _RARE_ and _RARE_ had indicated that a _RARE_ aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . STO
* Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen  _RARE_  _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ discussed the use of aerated _RARE_ for treating organic wastes . STO
* They indicated that a _RARE_ retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to _RARE_ per cent BOD reduction . STO
* Later , _RARE_ increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer months . STO
* It appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume . STO
* Red Bridge _RARE_ With the development of the Red Bridge _RARE_ south of _RARE_ City , Missouri , the _RARE_ was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage disposal . STO
* The sewage system from _RARE_ City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years . STO
* This necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 Aj . STO
* For the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1 . STO
* The oxidation pond has a surface area of _RARE_ acres and a depth of 4 Aj . STO
* The pond is currently serving _RARE_ persons or _RARE_ persons per _RARE_ . STO
* In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ odors . STO
* It was possible to maintain _RARE_ conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium _RARE_ until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from _RARE_ to green algae . STO
* The _RARE_ conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium _RARE_ . STO
* At the same time further expansion in the Red Bridge _RARE_ required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities . STO
* The large land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment _RARE_ _RARE_ to the _RARE_ . STO
* It was proposed that aerated _RARE_ be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development . STO
* _RARE_ lagoon The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system _RARE_ the _RARE_ to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its _RARE_ for treating domestic sewage . STO
* The pilot plant was a circular lagoon _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ at the surface and _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ at the bottom , 4 _RARE_ below the surface , with a volume of _RARE_ Aj . STO
* The side _RARE_ were _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ to prevent _RARE_ . STO
* The pilot lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area . STO
* The major _RARE_ was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the _RARE_ developed . STO
* The pilot lagoon was designed to handle the wastes from _RARE_ persons with a _RARE_ aeration period . STO
* Initially , the _RARE_ would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an _RARE_ period . STO
* This operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increasing load , over a reasonable period of time . STO
* The pilot plant was equipped with a _RARE_ _RARE_ aerator ( Figure 2 ) . STO
* The aerator had a _RARE_ drive to permit operation through a range of speeds . STO
* The sewage flow into the treatment plant was _RARE_ and continuously recorded on 24-hr. _RARE_ . STO
* The raw sewage was introduced directly under the _RARE_ aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents . STO
* The effluent was collected through two _RARE_ and discharged to the Blue River through a surface drainage ditch . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ samples were collected at weekly intervals . STO
* The long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent . STO
* _RARE_ samples would make any changes more readily discernible than daily samples . STO
* The composite samples were normally collected over a _RARE_ period , but an occasional 24-hr. composite was made . STO
* _RARE_ of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the _RARE_ composite samples with 24-hr. operations . STO
* The data indicated that the organic load during the _RARE_ _RARE_ was essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr. organic load . STO
* _RARE_ samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions . STO
* _RARE_ were made to take the grab samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a _RARE_ composite sample . STO
* A single 24-hr. composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical . STO
* _RARE_ plant operations The BOD of the _RARE_ to the pilot plant varied between _RARE_ and _RARE_ mgl with an average of _RARE_ Aj . STO
* This was equivalent to _RARE_ _RARE_ on a 24-hr. basis . STO
* The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a _RARE_ . STO
* The BOD in the effluent averaged _RARE_ mgl , a _RARE_ reduction over the 24-hr. period . STO
* _RARE_ of the data in Table 1 , shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent Aj . STO
* The periods of high effluent BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted . STO
* _RARE_ caused the aerator to _RARE_ , straining the drive belts . STO
* The _RARE_ of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage . STO
* The organic loading on the unit averaged _RARE_ lb of _RARE_ or about 2 lb _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ aeration capacity . STO
* Needless to say , the organic load was very low on a _RARE_ basis , but was _RARE_ lb _RARE_ on a surface loading basis . STO
* It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded _RARE_ _RARE_ system . STO
* The flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table 1 . STO
* With the spring _RARE_ the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open _RARE_ . STO
* As construction _RARE_ , the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced . STO
* The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from _RARE_ to _RARE_ days , averaging _RARE_ days . STO
* The large amount of _RARE_ _RARE_ from the _RARE_ store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem . STO
* The vegetables were not readily _RARE_ by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to _RARE_ on the surface . STO
* A _RARE_ device at the effluent _RARE_ prevented loss of most of these light solids . STO
* The average _RARE_ suspended solids in the effluent was 75 mgl while _RARE_ averaged _RARE_ mgl _RARE_ suspended solids . STO
* The average _RARE_ age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be _RARE_ days . STO
* The oxygen uptake rate in the mixed liquor averaged _RARE_ _RARE_ during the first four months of this study . STO
* _RARE_ in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand . STO
* The increase in oxygen uptake rates from _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to _RARE_ of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds . STO
* It appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active _RARE_ solids with the heavier , less active solids settling out . STO
* The suspended solids discharged in the effluent were found to be the major source of the Aj . STO
* _RARE_ of the suspended solids by a _RARE_ filter yielded an average effluent containing only 20 mgl Aj . STO
* The BOD in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 Aj . STO
* This low BOD was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by _RARE_ since the only dilution was surface _RARE_ which was very low during this study . STO
* _RARE_ examination _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by _RARE_ and _RARE_ for the various types of protozoa . STO
* It was found that the aerated lagoon was an _RARE_ _RARE_ system rather than an oxidation pond . STO
* At no time were algae found in the mixed liquor . STO
* The bacteria formed typical _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ particles were all small as the heavier _RARE_ settled out . STO
* Initially , the _RARE_ protozoa _RARE_ , but they soon gave way to the free swimming _RARE_ protozoa . STO
* As the temperature decreased , the number of free swimming _RARE_ protozoa decreased . STO
* Very little protozoa activity existed below _RARE_ . STO
* When the temperature reached _RARE_ all _RARE_ activity _RARE_ ; ; but as the temperature rose , the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly . STO
* Only once were stalked _RARE_ found in the mixed liquor . STO
* The _RARE_ of free swimming _RARE_ protozoa is _RARE_ of a high _RARE_ population . STO
* _RARE_ transfer One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates . STO
* The data given in Table 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator . STO
* The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29 , 1961 . STO
* An extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water . STO
* The added resistance to the rotor _RARE_ the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity . STO
* It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and _RARE_ , but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen . STO
* A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate . STO
* Five of the tests were conducted with a _RARE_ cover to _RARE_ an ice cover . STO
* The rate of oxygen transfer at _RARE_  _RARE_ dissolved oxygen concentration and _RARE_ for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3 . STO
* The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at _RARE_ mgl dissolved oxygen was calculated as _RARE_ _RARE_ at a maximum rate of _RARE_ Aj . STO
* The actual power requirements indicated 2 lb. oxygen transfer  _RARE_  _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface . STO
* _RARE_ pond During this study _RARE_ conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ after this study ended _RARE_ conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium _RARE_ . STO
* The location of the oxidation pond in a _RARE_ residential area makes odor _RARE_ a sensitive problem for the _RARE_ . STO
* The organic concentration in the _RARE_ raw sewage ranged from _RARE_ to _RARE_ mgl of BOD with an average of _RARE_ Aj . STO
* The BOD data are given in Table 4 . STO
* A single 24-hr. composite sample had a BOD of _RARE_ mgl , indicating a typical domestic sewage . STO
* The daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged _RARE_ _RARE_ , giving a retention period of 42 days . STO
* The organic loading on the pond was slightly under 60 lb. BOD  day  _RARE_ . STO
* The effluent BOD averaged 34 mgl , a little lower than that of the study at _RARE_ indicated for a loading of 60 lb. Aj . STO
* The BOD of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of _RARE_ mg.  _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ examination of the effluent showed that minimum BOD occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather . STO
* When the algae began to build up again , the effluent BOD rose . STO
* During the two weeks when the algae disappeared from the effluent _RARE_ in the effluent were 18 and 16 Aj . STO
* Thus , the three main categories of _RARE_ warfare operations are defense of _RARE_ , defense of naval forces , and area defense . STO
* The last category _RARE_ the others in _RARE_ operations and near _RARE_ and bases . STO
* To effect these operations , five elements exist ( 1 ) surface , ( 2 ) air , ( 3 ) mines , ( 4 ) submarine , and ( 5 ) fixed installations . STO
* _RARE_ forces have been used to provide defense _RARE_ around naval and merchant ship _RARE_ , air to furnish area _RARE_ , and mines for protection of limited areas . STO
* _RARE_ and shore installations are new elements . STO
* The submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in _RARE_ enemy access to ocean areas . STO
* _RARE_ installations offer possibilities for area detection . STO
* _RARE_ warfare is being _RARE_ against submarine targets . STO
* A sixth element , not always considered , is intelligence . STO
* It includes operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment . STO
* _RARE_ intelligence presumably will be available from our national intelligence agencies ; ; intelligence on the environment will come from the recently _RARE_ program in _RARE_ . STO
* The major postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be considered _RARE_ but in combination and as being mutually supporting . STO
* _RARE_ for an over-all concept _RARE_ on submarine defense has not always been clear-cut . STO
* _RARE_ of single elements tend to _RARE_ _RARE_ of that element without determining if it is justified , and the element with the most enthusiastic and _RARE_ _RARE_ has assumed the greatest importance . STO
* Consequently , air , surface , and submarine elements _RARE_ the mine , fixed installations , and intelligence . STO
* These have sought more and more of what they have . STO
* Each seems to _RARE_ for elimination of the necessity for the others . STO
* This , despite postwar experience _RARE_ that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting . STO
* Thus , the most productive areas are not necessarily the most stressed . STO
* This is stated to emphasize the necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense , one which would provide positions of relative importance to _RARE_ elements based on _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be _RARE_ to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective . STO
* An over-all concept would have other advantages . STO
* It would allow presentation to the public of a unified approach . STO
* Now the problem is presented _RARE_ and sometimes _RARE_ . STO
* While one element is _RARE_ progress , another is _RARE_ its problems . STO
* The result can only be confusion in the public mind . STO
* A unified concept can serve as a guide to _RARE_ and , if public support is gained , will command _RARE_ support . STO
* _RARE_ main criticism of the Navy's _RARE_ effort is that it cannot determine where any one company or industry can apply its skills and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ guidance , industry _RARE_ its own areas . STO
* The result , coupled with the _RARE_ for which American industry is famous , is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas . STO
* An over-all concept will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield greatest dividends . STO
* Therefore , a broad concept of over-all submarine defense is needed for _RARE_ of the Navy's efforts , for a logical presentation to the public , for industry's guidance , and as a basis for a program to the Congress . STO
* _RARE_ involved in an over-all concept That which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of _RARE_ warfare . STO
* Russia _RARE_ the _RARE_ of submarines in the world , divided between her various _RARE_ . STO
* Some are also in _RARE_ and others are on loan to _RARE_ . STO
* Other countries which may _RARE_ or _RARE_ become Communist can furnish bases . STO
* Communist target areas can be assumed , but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with Soviet intentions . STO
* _RARE_ can come from almost any direction against many locations . STO
* _RARE_ , then , the first principle of the plan must be that it is not _RARE_ oriented toward any geographical area . STO
* It is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building , at bases , in transit , and on station . STO
* _RARE_ of the _RARE_ building and base complex , however , requires _RARE_ on enemy territory , which is possible only in event of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* In transit or on station , it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an _RARE_ act . STO
* The _RARE_ are _RARE_ at _RARE_ _RARE_ short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage . STO
* Therefore the second principle of the plan must be that , while providing for _RARE_ _RARE_ , its effectiveness is not dependent on general war . STO
* _RARE_ warfare does not involve _RARE_ between large _RARE_ forces , with the decision a result of a single battle . STO
* It is a war of _RARE_ , of single actions , of an exchange of losses . STO
* This exchange must result in our ending up with some effective units . STO
* Initially , having fewer units of some elements -- especially submarines -- than the _RARE_ , our capabilities need to be sufficiently greater than theirs , so that the exchange will be in our favor . STO
* Therefore , the third principle of the plan must be that it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types , unless at an assured favorable exchange rate . STO
* The submarine has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since World War 2 . STO
* Its speed has increased , it operates at increasingly greater depths , its _RARE_ _RARE_ is becoming _RARE_ , and it will become even more silent . STO
* The next developments will probably be in _RARE_ . STO
* The missile can gradually be expected to replace the _RARE_ . STO
* As detection _RARE_ increase , weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these _RARE_ . STO
* Therefore , the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the _RARE_ . STO
* No element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense . STO
* Some elements support the others , but all have limitations . STO
* Some limitations of one element can be _RARE_ for by a capability of another . STO
* _RARE_ used in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements . STO
* Therefore , the _RARE_ fifth principle must be that it _RARE_ on the capabilities of all elements in combination . STO
* _RARE_ the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces . STO
* _RARE_ would be astronomical and current fiscal policies make this an _RARE_ solution . STO
* _RARE_ , aircraft procurement , and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything . STO
* Therefore , any measures taken in _RARE_ which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when _RARE_ occur . STO
* Therefore , the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements . STO
* The world is constantly changing ; ; what was new yesterday is _RARE_ today . STO
* The seventh principle of the plan is _RARE_ ; ; it must be flexible enough to allow for technological _RARE_ , scientific progress , and changes in world conditions . STO
* _RARE_ elements in _RARE_ operations To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated , the mission has been stated , broad principles _RARE_ its content laid down , and the supporting elements listed . STO
* Before considering these elements in more detail , an additional requirement should be stated . STO
* Large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks . STO
* Therefore , because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required , the plan should provide for expanding area coverage . STO
* But it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically . STO
* Consequently , the system giving area coverage ( if such coverage is less than world wide ) must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile . STO
* Since effective area coverage appears fairly remote , the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements : air , surface , _RARE_ , fixed installations , mines , and intelligence . STO
* These are arranged approximately in the order of the _RARE_ of their _RARE_ but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result . STO
* _RARE_ , as used _RARE_ , will include information on possible _RARE_ and on the environment which can affect operations . STO
* These can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence . STO
* In submarine defense these must have maximum stress . STO
* Good operational intelligence can _RARE_ sound planning , greatly reduce force requirements , and increase _RARE_ effectiveness . STO
* _RARE_ intelligence is just as important . STO
* The ocean presently _RARE_ with the target . STO
* _RARE_ knowledge of the science of _RARE_ can bring the environment to our side , resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and _RARE_ , a decrease in enemy capabilities , and the development of methods of _RARE_ on the environment . STO
* Therefore , improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and , as it supports all other elements , rates a top priority . STO
* _RARE_ intelligence is important , but of equal importance is its translation into usable form . STO
* A program is needed to translate the results of _RARE_ research into _RARE_ and operating instructions . STO
* _RARE_ this problem on a statistical basis is _RARE_ , because the _RARE_ has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions , but under the conditions most _RARE_ to him . STO
* Therefore , the _RARE_ commander must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions , in the area , at the time of encounter . STO
* All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then . STO
* Temperature , wind , oxygen content , depth , bottom character , and animal life are the chief environmental variables . STO
* There may be others . STO
* _RARE_ in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature , because more of the variables would be _RARE_ . STO
* These variations must eventually be measured _RARE_ as well as _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ in _RARE_ water conditions is encouraging , but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information . STO
* A concurrent effort is needed to make _RARE_ data useful on the spot . STO
* _RARE_ warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets . STO
* By its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater _RARE_ . STO
* Mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets . STO
* They are still considered to be for use in restricted waters , however , and targets must come within a few yards of them . STO
* Mines need to be recognized as a major element in _RARE_ warfare employment , extended to deep water , and have their effective area per unit increased . STO
* Mines can be used to deny access to great areas ; ; they are difficult to counter , cost little to maintain until required , and can be put into place quickly . STO
* A most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package . STO
* _RARE_ employment will reduce force requirements . STO
* For example , effective mine barriers from Florida to Cuba and across the _RARE_ _RARE_ from Cuba to Mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense , _RARE_ patrol , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ control , and mine defense for the entire Gulf of Mexico . STO
* More extended systems , covering all passage into the _RARE_ , would free the _RARE_ and the Gulf of Mexico from the previously listed requirements . STO
* _RARE_ covering the Gulf of St. Lawrence and possibly the entire _RARE_ of the United States are not impossible . STO
* Such mine defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open _RARE_ with consequent increase in the probability of success . STO
* The advantages inherent in mine warfare justify as great an importance for this element as is _RARE_ any of the other elements . STO
* _RARE_ installations are increasingly _RARE_ as the problem of area defense _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ which detect submarines over wide areas are attractive , although they can be only `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ forces are required to _RARE_ and attack detected targets , since the systems are not capable of _RARE_ a target . STO
* Such systems are expensive and are oriented geographically . STO
* In an over-all _RARE_ concept , dependence on and effort expended for such systems should be limited to those with _RARE_ capabilities . STO
* No general _RARE_ should be made until a model _RARE_ has been proved and its maximum capability determined . STO
* In addition , proposals for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a _RARE_ mobile system . STO
* _RARE_ installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems . STO
* The submarine has become increasingly attractive as an _RARE_ weapon system . STO
* It operates in its _RARE_ environment , and any advantage gained _RARE_ by the target is shared by the _RARE_ . STO
* But the submarine is a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of being _RARE_ . STO
* Two _RARE_ ( 1 , and 2 ) ) of _RARE_ acid ( _RARE_ ) which act as _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ by _RARE_ bacteria are _RARE_ from Aj . STO
* The 7 _RARE_ of _RARE_ are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 ( ( as shown with both _RARE_ and _RARE_ Af ) . STO
* _RARE_ of the 36 carbon atoms arise from Aj . STO
* All 28 _RARE_ of metabolite 1 ( ( a product of mild acid hydrolysis of 2 ) arise from Aj . STO
* _RARE_ 1 , isolated from the medium , however , showed a lower specific activity , which indicates _RARE_ synthesis of this metabolite . STO
* _RARE_ acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 , destroyed the biological activity of the compound and _RARE_ two _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ A has been obtained in _RARE_ form as a _RARE_ salt and free base . STO
* _RARE_ evidence _RARE_ indicates that the _RARE_ ( metabolite 1 ) ) is _RARE_ at a secondary _RARE_ bond . STO
* ( N. H. _RARE_ ; ; chemical studies are being _RARE_ with the cooperation of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* ) studies on _RARE_ -- Research on _RARE_ in mammalian sera was continued . STO
* One of the most interesting findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma _RARE_ to rare earth ions . STO
* The inhibition of the _RARE_ by very low concentrations of _RARE_ ion is probably the strongest known biological effect of rare earth _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ metal ions have been found to protect plasma _RARE_ against _RARE_ by _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The effects can be related to the structure of this _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ of serum and red blood cell _RARE_ was also established . STO
* Furthermore , the hydrolysis of _RARE_ was studied in mammalian sera , and it was found that it is _RARE_ by albumin ( or a factor attached to it ) in addition to _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ can distinguish the two activities . STO
* _RARE_ on the acceleration of human plasma _RARE_ were carried further . STO
* ( E. G. _RARE_ , L. E. _RARE_ , C. D. _RARE_ ) _RARE_ studies on modified _RARE_ proteins -- _RARE_ and _RARE_ methods were used to demonstrate the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ acid . STO
* ( R. V. _RARE_ ) A method was _RARE_ for _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* It was observed that _RARE_ _RARE_ are the same diameter ( 15 _RARE_ ) but much longer ( up to several microns ) than _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This unusual _RARE_ also was shown to _RARE_ a reversible thermal phase transformation . STO
* ( R. V. _RARE_ , M. D. _RARE_ ) studies on _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- This investigation involved several aspects . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , an active _RARE_ _RARE_ , was purified by _RARE_ in organic _RARE_ and repeated column chromatography ; ; _RARE_ electrophoresis and paper chromatography were used in preliminary structural studies ; ; _RARE_ effects in _RARE_ on isolated _RARE_ _RARE_ and in _RARE_ on blood pressure were _RARE_ ; ; special equipment required for _RARE_ _RARE_ and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles under various conditions was developed by the _RARE_ Section ( _RARE_ _RARE_ , W. C. _RARE_ , J. F. _RARE_ ) ; ; and enzymes which terminate the action of _RARE_ such as _RARE_ and perhaps _RARE_ _RARE_ were studied . STO
* Experiments are in progress to develop _RARE_ _RARE_ techniques for _RARE_ these enzymes and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions . STO
* ( E. G. _RARE_ , C. D. _RARE_ , A. G. _RARE_ , W. B. _RARE_ , E. M. _RARE_ ) seed proteins -- In a _RARE_ study of seed proteins , the _RARE_ of the Brazil nut have been investigated . STO
* In addition to the known principal _RARE_ , _RARE_ , three other _RARE_ distinct components have been observed . STO
* A _RARE_ protein of quite low molecular weight ( _RARE_ 10,000 ) has also been found in this system and partly characterized . STO
* ( E. F. _RARE_ , H. J. _RARE_ ) _RARE_ mechanics and _RARE_ theory of _RARE_ fluids -- On the basis of a _RARE_ assumption in function space , it is possible to prove that , for materials having the property that the stress is given by a functional of the history of the deformation gradients , the classical theory of _RARE_ _RARE_ is valid when the deformation has been _RARE_ for all times in the past . STO
* By strengthening the _RARE_ assumption , it has been possible to derive second and higher order theories of _RARE_ . STO
* In the _RARE_ theory , one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the _RARE_ stress _RARE_ function . STO
* ( B. D. _RARE_ with Walter _RARE_ , Department of _RARE_ , _RARE_ Institute of _RARE_ ) _RARE_ measurements -- An extensive series of measurements was made on a _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ _RARE_ instrument using forced _RARE_ _RARE_ , free _RARE_ , and creep measurements over the temperature range of Af to _RARE_ . STO
* As many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered _RARE_ . STO
* The simple _RARE_ _RARE_ valid for many _RARE_ systems did not hold here . STO
* It was possible , however , to _RARE_ the compliance into a sum of a _RARE_ component and two _RARE_ mechanisms , each compatible with the _RARE_ _RARE_ principle and with a consistent set of _RARE_ _RARE_ factors . STO
* ( _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ ) _RARE_ trace elements in tektites , meteorites , and related materials -- The results of _RARE_ of tektites ( natural glasses of unknown origin ) for gallium and germanium have shown that these glasses are probably produced from terrestrial ( or less likely from lunar ) matter by impact of a _RARE_ body . STO
* The gallium  germanium ratio is higher than that for ordinary _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ matter as a result of selective _RARE_ of the components of the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ is less _RARE_ than _RARE_ ( the main _RARE_ of tektites ) and germanium _RARE_ is more _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ ( tektites from Australia ) give the appearance of a second melting . STO
* In _RARE_ with this conclusion a higher trace gallium content was found in the portion ( _RARE_ ) that has undergone a second melting . STO
* The _RARE_ fractions of _RARE_ meteorites show gallium  germanium ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone melting at some point in their _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , another natural glass , is composed of nearly pure _RARE_ and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area . STO
* The gallium content , however , has been _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This glass is probably formed from _RARE_ _RARE_ sands by _RARE_ or _RARE_ impact . STO
* _RARE_ meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy to produce large terrestrial explosion _RARE_ may nevertheless _RARE_ only small quantities of material . STO
* Most of the impact energy is spent in _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* When rapid _RARE_ follows melting , impact glasses may result . STO
* These always contain metallic _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ glasses not containing _RARE_ _RARE_ may have been produced by _RARE_ meteorites or _RARE_ . STO
* No meteorites have ever been recovered from _RARE_ _RARE_ , and recent _RARE_ containing impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception of _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Western _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ contains impact glass with no metallic _RARE_ and no meteoritic material has been recovered . STO
* ( A. J. _RARE_ , John _RARE_ ) inorganic chemistry Preparation of a coordination compound is often accomplished by the simple method of _RARE_ a metal salt with a _RARE_ in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol . STO
* By applying this general principle , a great number of complex compounds of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , with _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few years . STO
* ( _RARE_ _RARE_ , E. M. _RARE_ , J. W. _RARE_ ) In the absence of direct evidence to the contrary , decomposition of solvent alcohol and coordination of its fragments to the metal were not considered , following the above _RARE_ assumption in _RARE_ coordination chemistry . STO
* Recent work with _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ as _RARE_ , however , has given evidence that _RARE_ and _RARE_ complexes may be readily formed by reaction with alcohol in some of these systems . STO
* Some of the previously reported compounds have thus been _RARE_ and a series of new _RARE_ and _RARE_ compounds discovered , the more representative examples being Af , Af , Af , Af and Af ( Af ) . STO
* The coordination complexes formed by transition _RARE_ with primary and secondary _RARE_ and _RARE_ are being investigated ( R. G. _RARE_ ) . STO
* _RARE_ interest is directed towards the condensation of these _RARE_ with metal _RARE_ to form substituted _RARE_ or _RARE_ complexes . STO
* During the past year , these _RARE_ have yielded some unusual _RARE_ complexes of nickel ( 2 ) and some interesting _RARE_ _RARE_ complexes of _RARE_ ( 2 ) ( see figure ) , as well as new compounds of the well-known type Af . STO
* The structures , properties , and reactions of these compounds are being studied . STO
* In another study _RARE_ aluminum _RARE_ and related species , prepared _RARE_ by _RARE_ hydrolysis , are being characterized and investigated _RARE_ in the _RARE_ region with a view to identification and _RARE_ _RARE_ of the phases formed under varying _RARE_ conditions . STO
* ( J. A. _RARE_ , N. L. _RARE_ ) structure and properties of _RARE_ elasticity of _RARE_ _RARE_ -- The theory of elasticity of _RARE_ _RARE_ has been developed on a more general basis and the equations of state relating variables of pressure , volume , temperature , stress and strain have been precisely _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ has been treated in detail . STO
* The various _RARE_ _RARE_ for constancy of volume and strain , constancy of pressure and strain , and constancy of pressure and length have been _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ accompanying _RARE_ and the simultaneously developed _RARE_ of _RARE_ have been related to the _RARE_ . STO
* In continuation of these theoretical studies , a more precise _RARE_ of the effects of _RARE_ in network structure is sought . STO
* ( P. J. _RARE_ , C. A. J. _RARE_ ) chain _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ -- Recent theoretical work to _RARE_ the dimensions of _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ and _RARE_ has been extended to include more general types of _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ distance of the _RARE_ chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement with values deduced from viscosity data . STO
* These studies are being extended to different _RARE_ to increase our knowledge about the _RARE_ to rotation around chain bonds . STO
* ( C. A. J. _RARE_ , A. A. _RARE_ ) _RARE_ in _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- The _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ Af units _RARE_ with a minor percentage of Af is limited by the inability of the crystal _RARE_ characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky side group of the latter . STO
* Only _RARE_ _RARE_ of the former are _RARE_ for formation of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ on the lengths of these _RARE_ _RARE_ the stability of the _RARE_ short _RARE_ which can be formed , and this is reflected in a broadening of the melting range . STO
* ( Robert _RARE_ , J. B. Jackson , P. J. _RARE_ ) _RARE_ executed melting studies on this system ( M. J. _RARE_ ) permit quantitative _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ by reduced _RARE_ length . STO
* The complex _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ is necessarily dependent on the same factor . STO
* Hence , the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations in the latter field . STO
* _RARE_ of muscle -- _RARE_ muscle , in the presence of the physiological agent ( _RARE_ ) responsible for _RARE_ energy to the _RARE_ active proteins of muscle , has been shown to _RARE_ a contraction which is highly sensitive both to temperature and to solvent composition in _RARE_ of _RARE_ and water . STO
* Experiments carried out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of several degrees _RARE_ and to a concentration range of only several per cent . STO
* The contraction therefore _RARE_ of the character of a phase transition . STO
* While _RARE_ appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction , its presence and _RARE_ hydrolysis of it by the muscle protein _RARE_ are not the only criteria for contraction . STO
* ( C. A. J. _RARE_ , P. J. _RARE_ ) anionic _RARE_ -- One of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques is the synthesis of _RARE_ of extremely narrow molecular weight distribution . STO
* A simple process for the preparation of nearly _RARE_ _RARE_ of predictable molecular weight has been developed . STO
* The preparation of such products is not new , but the systems _RARE_ employed in _RARE_ have commanded considerable experimental skill and starting materials of a high _RARE_ . STO
* In the new process impurities present in the solvent ( _RARE_ ) , the _RARE_ , and in the reaction system which would cause _RARE_ of propagation centers , are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by _RARE_ addition of _RARE_ , a mixture of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , at a temperature low enough to _RARE_ chain growth . STO
* Upon completion of the _RARE_ step , additional _RARE_ appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample desired is added , and the system is then warmed to the polymerization temperature , at which the reaction is allowed to go to completion . STO
* The _RARE_ of the molecular weights was found to be within _RARE_ for the _RARE_ prepared , with Af ratios less than _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ to observations with _RARE_ , no apparent change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable periods of time in _RARE_ as solvent . STO
* _RARE_ : In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to _RARE_ and identify chemical substances . STO
* T. V. Barker , who developed the _RARE_ system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . STO

* ( The association of Wiley & Sons with the _RARE_ _RARE_ dates back to _RARE_ when they published the second edition of the system . STO
* ) The two volumes are available from the _RARE_ for _RARE_ and _RARE_ , respectively . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ Institute organization : `` The _RARE_ Institute '' , which was established in 1958 , is a group activity _RARE_ with the _RARE_ Department of The Pennsylvania State University , University _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* Ray _RARE_ is the Director . STO
* The Institute _RARE_ its name from Paul _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ work which appeared between _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ staff is large and consists of professional _RARE_ , _RARE_ students , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , technical editor , machine operators , _RARE_ help , and others . STO
* There are also corresponding members and outside _RARE_ groups . STO
* The Air Force Office of _RARE_ Research has provided financial assistance in the early stages of the _RARE_ program . STO
* Substances : All _RARE_ substances and other _RARE_ materials . STO
* Properties : The aim is to collect a very broad range of physical , chemical , morphological , and structural data for crystals on an _RARE_ scale and to seek all possible useful and revealing _RARE_ of properties with internal structure . STO
* Sources of data : The first stage of operation has centered on the literature _RARE_ of critical or _RARE_ _RARE_ such as the Barker Index . STO
* _RARE_ of primary literature will follow . STO
* _RARE_ data will be available to the _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ groups and individuals . STO
* Criticality : _RARE_ evaluation of all data compiled is not a primary aim of this project . STO
* However , the proposed correlation of the many _RARE_ properties of crystals will reveal _RARE_ in the recorded data and suggest areas for _RARE_ . STO
* In addition , the availability of _RARE_ will permit _RARE_ and _RARE_ of much structural information . STO
* Use of nomenclature , symbols , units , physical constants : For _RARE_ or tape storage of information all literature values must be _RARE_ to a common language . STO
* In this way a degree of _RARE_ of nomenclature , symbols , and units will be realized . STO
* Because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing . STO
* The basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between _RARE_ or _RARE_ , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of _RARE_ or production to areas of consumption . STO
* In earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival . STO
* In the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations , _RARE_ techniques have sought also to bring variety , peak _RARE_ , and optimum taste and _RARE_ in foods at reasonable cost to the consumer . STO
* With the development of nuclear technology , _RARE_ materials , and machine radiation sources in recent years , the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout the world . STO
* An early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon _RARE_ . STO
* Interest remained , however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for _RARE_ spoilage losses and for _RARE_ some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing , or without _RARE_ heat or _RARE_ with their attendant taste alterations . STO
* _RARE_ responsible for the spoilage of foods The chief factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh _RARE_ are ( 1 ) microorganisms such as bacteria , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , ( 2 ) enzymes , ( 3 ) insects , ( 4 ) _RARE_ , and ( 5 ) chemical reactions . STO
* _RARE_ are often responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods . STO
* Of special concern is the growth of bacteria such as _RARE_ _RARE_ which generate _RARE_ products . STO
* _RARE_ action in stored food produces changes which can _RARE_ affect the appearance of food or its palatability . STO
* _RARE_ by chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with its environment , as in _RARE_ of the walls of metal _RARE_ or the reaction of _RARE_ with oxygen in the air to produce _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ is a naturally occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and similar root vegetables . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain . STO
* The presence of _RARE_ organisms such as _RARE_ _RARE_ in pork _RARE_ another factor which must be dealt with in food processing . STO
* To permit the storage of food for long periods of time , a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of _RARE_ action . STO
* The term `` sterilization '' applies to methods involving essentially complete destruction of all microorganisms . STO
* Food treated in this manner and protected from _RARE_ by _RARE_ methods of _RARE_ and _RARE_ presumably could be stored for long periods without refrigeration . STO
* The process of `` _RARE_ '' involves _RARE_ and less prolonged heat treatment which _RARE_ the destruction of most , but not all , of the microorganisms . STO
* Less severe thermal treatment as by _RARE_ or _RARE_ serves to _RARE_ enzymes . STO
* General effects of ionizing radiation _RARE_ radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage or , at lower doses , can inhibit their action . STO
* It _RARE_ a means of _RARE_ insects in stored grain products as well as certain _RARE_ organisms present in meats . STO
* _RARE_ of enzymes is also possible , although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 _RARE_ or more . STO
* Because of _RARE_ _RARE_ , odors , colors , and generally low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude , the _RARE_ of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation by the conventional _RARE_ methods of _RARE_ . STO
* Radiation does not _RARE_ the chemical spoilage of food . STO
* It will , however , inhibit the _RARE_ of potatoes and other root vegetables . STO
* The radiation doses required for the preservation of foods are in the following _RARE_ : 1 . STO
* For radiosterilization , to destroy all organisms for long-term preservation -- about _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ foods of low salt content . STO
* 2 . STO
* For radiopasteurization , to partially destroy microorganisms ; ; results vary with types of food , storage conditions , and objectives of treatment -- commonly of the order of _RARE_ _RARE_ but up to about _RARE_ Aj . STO
* 3 . STO
* For destruction of insects -- about _RARE_ Aj . STO
* 4 . STO
* For _RARE_ the _RARE_ of root vegetables -- _RARE_ to 10,000 Aj . STO
* _RARE_ foods with ionizing radiation leads to some _RARE_ side effects , particularly at the higher radiation _RARE_ . STO
* In this respect , the general palatability and individual acceptance of most _RARE_ foods has , to date , been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods . STO
* A number of foods are quite _RARE_ as _RARE_ taste and palatability , however , at _RARE_ substantially less than sterilization levels . STO
* Moreover , the _RARE_ value of irradiated foods apparently _RARE_ little , if any , change , although some of the _RARE_ _RARE_ are affected by sterilization doses . STO
* Radiation sources For irradiation of food , the results obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation , and X-ray , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ electron radiation are suitable . STO
* _RARE_ from availability and economic considerations , each has certain practical advantages ; ; for example , _RARE_ _RARE_ give deeper _RARE_ but cannot be focused or _RARE_ , whereas _RARE_ electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be irradiated . STO
* _RARE_ of a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factors including required dose rate , load factor , _RARE_ , convenience , safety , and most important , costs . STO
* Of the potentially useful sources of ionizing _RARE_ , _RARE_ sources , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ products , or a _RARE_ irradiation loop system using a material such as an _RARE_ salt have received most attention for _RARE_ systems . STO
* Of the various particle _RARE_ , the Van De _RARE_ machines , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and linear _RARE_ are the principal ones available for commercial use . STO
* _RARE_ of the effective energy produced by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of _RARE_ processes . STO
* _RARE_ production costs of radiation energy from machine and _RARE_ sources range from $1 to _RARE_ per Aj . STO
* _RARE_ energy for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per _RARE_ for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per _RARE_ for process steam . STO
* Radiation , therefore , is at an initial cost _RARE_ even though only 1 to 10 per cent as much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization or radiosterilization . STO
* What are the possibilities of lowered radiation production costs for the future ? STO
* It has been estimated that for applications on a _RARE_ scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per _RARE_ for large-scale _RARE_ or for _RARE_ radiation generated in a _RARE_ core . STO
* No comparable _RARE_ in the cost of _RARE_ radiation are foreseen . STO
* Such projections , however , appear highly _RARE_ and the _RARE_ involved are far beyond those foreseen for _RARE_ facilities . STO
* Because agricultural activities are _RARE_ and the areas of production and _RARE_ of many foods are widely scattered geographically , and because of the high cost of _RARE_ bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location , the use of large central processing stations , where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the _RARE_ range might be utilized , is _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Present status of irradiation preservation of foods The objective of complete sterilization of foods is to produce a _RARE_ and _RARE_ product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time . STO
* Chief interest in radiosterilization _RARE_ in the military services . STO
* For them , providing _RARE_ food under battle or emergency conditions is a _RARE_ consideration . STO
* They require completely _RARE_ foods capable of being stored without refrigeration , preferably items already cooked and ready to eat . STO
* High _RARE_ value , variety , palatability , and _RARE_ appearance are important for reasons of morale . STO
* _RARE_ for rear stations , which require cooking , but no refrigeration , are also of interest . STO
* Of primary interest are meats . STO
* _RARE_ , which produces fewer adverse _RARE_ changes in food products , has potential usefulness in _RARE_ the keeping qualities of fresh and _RARE_ food items . STO
* Thus , food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak _RARE_ and palatability . STO
* _RARE_ interest is chiefly in this type of treatment , as is military interest under _RARE_ conditions . STO
* The present status of food preservation by ionizing radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs . STO
* _RARE_ The radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation . STO
* To date , the one meat showing favorable results at sterilization doses is pork . STO
* Of particular interest to the military services is the demonstration that _RARE_ pork , after radiosterilization , is superior in palatability to available _RARE_ pork products . STO
* _RARE_ with beef have been largely _RARE_ because of the development of _RARE_ . STO
* A prime objective of the Army _RARE_ Corps program is to find the reasons for _RARE_ low palatability and means of overcoming it , since it is a major and desirable _RARE_ item . STO
* _RARE_ because _RARE_ heat treatment is needed to _RARE_ enzymes before radiosterilization , treated fresh meats have the appearance of _RARE_ or _RARE_ meat . STO
* _RARE_ is a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meats , but problems of commercial _RARE_ remain . STO
* _RARE_ radiation doses of from _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ can extend the shelf life ( at 35 F ) of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks . STO
* However , the problem of consumer _RARE_ remains . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ process _RARE_ the treated beef and liquid _RARE_ in _RARE_ cuts . STO
* _RARE_ beef irradiated in the absence of oxygen _RARE_ an _RARE_ pink color . STO
* When _RARE_ and _RARE_ are irradiated at _RARE_ doses , the meat becomes _RARE_ , the fat becomes _RARE_ , and , again , _RARE_ changes in color occur . STO
* _RARE_ meats such as fresh pork _RARE_ and _RARE_ have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration , and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities . STO
* However , a major problem here is one of scale of processing ; ; ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local level , whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities . STO
* The problems of color change by _RARE_ and liquid accumulation within the package are the same as for solid cuts . STO
* _RARE_ cooked items containing meat portions , as in `` frozen dinners '' might offer a potential use for radiopasteurization . STO
* The principal potential advantage would be that the finished product could be _RARE_ and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being frozen . STO
* A _RARE_ item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type . STO
* _RARE_ processes for _RARE_ meats are by canning and freezing . STO
* _RARE_ of canning meat are in the range of _RARE_ to 5 cents per pound ; ; costs of freezing are in the area of 2 to _RARE_ cents per pound . STO
* The table on page 10 shows costs of canning and freezing meat , and estimated costs for irradiation under certain assumed conditions . STO
* Under the conditions of comparison , it will be noted that : ( 1 ) _RARE_ ( at 3 _RARE_ ) is more expensive than canning , particularly for the _RARE_ source . STO
* ( 2 ) _RARE_ by either the electron accelerator or _RARE_ source is in the range of freezing costs . STO
* ( 3 ) _RARE_ using the _RARE_ source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator . STO
* _RARE_ Results of irradiation tests with _RARE_ have been quite successful . STO
* At _RARE_ doses , good palatability results , with a minimum of changes in appearance , taste , and odor . STO
* _RARE_ has also been successful , and the shelf life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under _RARE_ storage as compared with about 10 days for the _RARE_ product . STO
* _RARE_ taste and odor are retained by the irradiated and _RARE_ chicken . STO
* _RARE_ of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed , however , for two reasons : ( 1 ) the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved _RARE_ and _RARE_ practices , and ( 2 ) treatment by _RARE_ , a measure already approved by the Federal Food and _RARE_ Administration , serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0.5 cents per pound . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ products are extremely _RARE_ . STO
* Although refrigeration has served to extend the storage life of these products , substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the _RARE_ could be served adequately . STO
* Furthermore , it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible . STO
* The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , _RARE_ _RARE_ knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating . STO
* The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic _RARE_ , against distance of removal . STO
* Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential _RARE_ pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness . STO
* This , too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut . STO
* A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to _RARE_ measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such _RARE_ as iron and other _RARE_ , glass , wood , and plastic surfaces . STO
* The measurement of _RARE_ on _RARE_ can also readily be carried out . STO
* Hesiometer results have been found to compare _RARE_ with manual knife scratching tests . STO
* The _RARE_ method , however , is about 100 times more sensitive and _RARE_ numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time . STO
* If a _RARE_ coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle , a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating . STO
* At low _RARE_ a cutting ( or _RARE_ ) phenomenon is often encountered . STO
* As the coating becomes _RARE_ , the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure . STO
* If the coating becomes still _RARE_ , a peeling type failure finally can occur . STO
* The typical appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated in Figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 , which are single frame _RARE_ of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal process . STO
* It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating . STO
* The molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface . STO
* The pictures of Figs. 3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at , or close to , the _RARE_ between coating and substrate . STO
* If the force required to remove the coatings is plotted against film thickness , a graph as illustrated _RARE_ in Fig. 5 may _RARE_ result . STO
* Here , H is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and T is the film thickness . STO
* It can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal . STO
* Also , it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response , while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature . STO
* It should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness . STO
* _RARE_ the interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case . STO
* What then , are the factors that contribute to these phenomena ? STO
* Why should the `` practical _RARE_ '' of a coating as _RARE_ by a knife method change , initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing _RARE_ to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness ? STO
* _RARE_ mechanism of cohesive failure The cutting ( or _RARE_ ) removal process has been previously described . STO
* It was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure . STO
* The details of the removal process are shown _RARE_ in Fig. 6 . STO
* The various forces result from the reaction of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane , which makes an angle **yf with the substrate . STO
* The action and reaction forces are R and Af , respectively , and are equal and opposite in direction . STO
* All the other force vectors are derived from these . STO
* Af is the force required to cut a coating of thickness T from the substrate . STO
* Af is the shear force along the shear plane ; ; Af and Af are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife , respectively ; ; Af is the normal _RARE_ force acting on the shear plane ; ; Af is the friction force between chip and knife surfaces , and P is the normal force acting on the face of the knife . STO
* **yc is the rake angle of the knife ; ; **yf is the angle the shear plane makes with the substrate ; ; _RARE_ is the friction angle ; ; and _RARE_ is the angle the _RARE_ make with the plane of the substrate . STO
* An analysis of the vector relationships shows that the rake angle **yc and the friction angle _RARE_ determine the vector direction Af of the force _RARE_ R and Af . STO
* Consequently , both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process . STO
* It is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of R directly . STO
* In actual practice , the values most readily _RARE_ to measurement are the cutting force Af and the shear angle Aj . STO
* These two values and the rake angle **yc are sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships . STO
* **yc is defined by the geometry of the knife ; ; **yf can readily be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after cutting from the substrate ; ; Af is _RARE_ determined . STO
* From Fig. 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force is Af where **yl is the shear strength of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material , _RARE_ is the width of the removed coating and T is its thickness . STO
* If the cutting force , Af , is plotted against film thickness , a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope Af . STO
* However , in the actual assessment of the cutting force by _RARE_ methods for any thickness of coating a number of _RARE_ effects occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured value larger than the true cutting force indicated by _RARE_ ( 1 ) . STO
* _RARE_ knife One of these is the fact that the knife employed , no matter how well _RARE_ , will have a slightly rounded cutting edge . STO
* This _RARE_ that **yc , the rake angle , is no longer a constant to zero film thickness . STO
* The curvature of this _RARE_ is , in the case of the _RARE_ knife employed in the Hesiometer , determined by the grain sizes of the polished _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ crystals _RARE_ together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.1 to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The force vector concept of Fig. 6 can readily be applied to this condition also . STO
* Because the rake angle Af at the tip of the knife is very much smaller ( or even negative ) when compared to the value of **yc for the major portion of the knife , a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result . STO
* This _RARE_ to the relationship : Af , where Af is the intercept at zero thickness of the _RARE_ of the slope indicated in _RARE_ ( 1 ) , Af is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the _RARE_ off of the knife tip , Af is a straight line first approximation of this _RARE_ , and the other symbols are equivalent to those of _RARE_ ( 1 ) . STO
* It can be seen that Af is a constant , and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife . STO
* The _RARE_ the knife , the higher is the value of Af . STO
* The importance of a hard , _RARE_ knife material like the _RARE_ employed in the Hesiometer immediately becomes apparent . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ would blunt very rapidly , making the value of Af _RARE_ . STO
* In extreme cases of very soft _RARE_ this value may even change during the course of a measurement . STO
* _RARE_ friction A second factor which _RARE_ into the practical measurement of the _RARE_ determined cutting force is the _RARE_ resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate . STO
* This is not a constant value like Af , but varies with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the _RARE_ R and Af of Fig. 6 . STO
* Under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip _RARE_ a thrust Af against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of Af . STO
* The resultant friction force , Af is thus directly proportional to Af and consequently also to film thickness . STO
* The value of Af can readily be _RARE_ by determining the _RARE_ force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external loadings . STO
* A straight line relationship is usually observed in a plot of Af against load L , having slope _RARE_ , and Af . STO
* Since the load L , under actual cutting conditions is caused by Af , it can be seen that Af . STO
* The measured force , H , in cutting removal of coatings from their _RARE_ consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating , Af , that due to the _RARE_ of the knife , Af , and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate , Af , or Af . STO
* The first two forces are directly _RARE_ and depend upon film thickness , whereas Af is independent of these two and is a constant for a given _RARE_ combination . STO
* These theoretical relationships are more clearly illustrated in Fig. 7 and their sum can be seen to _RARE_ in form with practical measurements made with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of Fig. 5 for the cutting mechanism . STO
* _RARE_ mechanism of cohesive failure Although a large number of coatings systems , particularly at low _RARE_ fail _RARE_ by the cutting mechanism , frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place . STO
* This is a _RARE_ , dynamic type failure encountered with very _RARE_ coatings _RARE_ or very highly _RARE_ films . STO
* This is shown in the _RARE_ of Fig. 8 . STO
* The basic difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the _RARE_ mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ occurs along the shear plane . STO
* The detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied _RARE_ by Merchant for metal cutting , and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings . STO
* By studying high speed movies made of this type of failure , the sequence of relationships as _RARE_ illustrated in Fig. 9 could be observed . STO
* In the first picture ( _RARE_ ) the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip formation . STO
* In the next , the shear plane angle is high , and extends to the inclined work surface . STO
* With increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases . STO
* Eventually , _RARE_ occurs along the shear plane ( _RARE_ ) , and the cycle _RARE_ itself . STO
* Merchant has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the _RARE_ chip formation provided the proper values of _RARE_ shear angle and _RARE_ chip thickness or _RARE_ area are used . STO
* Consequently , if the shear angle **yf is replaced by the _RARE_ angle Af , the relationships as described in _RARE_ ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) will directly apply . STO
* The cracking mechanism Under equilibrium cutting conditions , the chip _RARE_ a force Af against the coating and an equal opposite force Af against the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in Fig. 6 . STO
* If the rake angle **yc of the knife is high enough and the friction angle _RARE_ between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for Af , the resultant vector R will lie above the plane of the substrate . STO
* Within only a few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight . STO
* _RARE_ foam , as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955 . STO
* Yet last year's volume probably _RARE_ 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of _RARE_ million lb. by _RARE_ . STO
* Many of the other foamed plastics , particularly the _RARE_ , show similar growth potential . STO
* And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated . STO
* As this issue goes to press , for example , one manufacturer has announced an _RARE_ foam with outstanding _RARE_ and impact strength ; ; another reports that a _RARE_ _RARE_ , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated . STO
* On the following pages , each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail , as to properties , applications , and methods of processing . STO
* It might be well to point out , however , some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved . STO
* In urethane foams , for example , there has been a definite trend toward the _RARE_ materials ( which are now available in _RARE_ rigid foam systems ) and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot molding . STO
* Most manufacturers also seem to be _RARE_ on _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the _RARE_ building markets . STO
* _RARE_ foam as an _RARE_ is also coming in for a good deal of attention . STO
* In one outstanding example , _RARE_ _RARE_ found that by _RARE_ to urethane foam _RARE_ , they could increase the storage capacity of gas _RARE_ to make them competitive with electric models . STO
* Much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing the urethane foams , including _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and molding ( see article , p. _RARE_ for details ) . STO
* And in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment _RARE_ , new _RARE_ and new methods of _RARE_ foam to a substrate have been developed . STO
* New techniques for automatic molding of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ have helped _RARE_ that particular material into a number of new consumer applications , including _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , flower _RARE_ , and _RARE_ swimming _RARE_ . STO
* Two other _RARE_ areas which contributed to _RARE_ _RARE_ growth during the year were _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ complicated _RARE_ units ) and _RARE_ building panels . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ film or sheet -- claimed to be competitive _RARE_ with paper -- also showed much potential , particularly for _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ panels for building utility shelters that consist of _RARE_ paper _RARE_ and rigid _RARE_ foam _RARE_ also aroused interest in the construction field . STO
* In _RARE_ foam , the big news was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material ( for details , see P. _RARE_ ) . STO
* Better `` hand '' , a more _RARE_ feel , and better _RARE_ properties were claimed to be the result . STO
* Several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for _RARE_ or molding _RARE_ products with a slight _RARE_ core that would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end product to any great extent . STO
* _RARE_ interested in additional information on foams are referred to the _RARE_ _RARE_ Chart _RARE_ in the _RARE_ Data section and to the list of references which appears below . STO
* _RARE_ foams Since the _RARE_ _RARE_ , when urethane foam first made its appearance in the American market , growth has been little short of fantastic . STO
* Present estimates are that production _RARE_ the _RARE_ mark in 1960 ( 85 to _RARE_ million lb. for flexible , 10 or 11 million lb. for rigid ) ; ; by _RARE_ , production may range from 200 to _RARE_ million lb. for flexible and from _RARE_ to _RARE_ million lb. for rigid . STO
* The markets that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , as just one example , can easily take millions of pounds ; ; foamed refrigerator _RARE_ is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer ; ; and use of the foam for garment _RARE_ is only now getting off the ground , with volume potential in the _RARE_ . STO
* Basic chemistry _RARE_ foams are , basically , reaction products of _RARE_ materials and _RARE_ ( usually _RARE_ _RARE_ ) . STO
* _RARE_ can be either one of two types -- carbon _RARE_ gas generated by the reaction of water on the _RARE_ or mechanical blowing through the use of a _RARE_ liquid such as a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The most important factor in determining what properties the _RARE_ will have is quite naturally the type of _RARE_ compound that is used in its production . STO
* _RARE_ , the main types used were various compositions of _RARE_ . STO
* These are still in wide use today , particularly in _RARE_ formulations , for such applications as _RARE_ for _RARE_ structural panels , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ safety _RARE_ , arm rests , etc. . STO
* More recently , _RARE_ -- again in varied compositions , molecular weights , and _RARE_ -- have come into use at first for the flexible foams , just lately for the _RARE_ . STO
* The polyether _RARE_ are claimed to give flexible _RARE_ a _RARE_ action which is much desired in _RARE_ . STO
* Although the first polyether foams on the market had to be produced by the _RARE_ _RARE_ method , today , thanks to new _RARE_ , they can be produced by a one-shot technique . STO
* It is possible that the polyether foams may soon be _RARE_ on a production basis in low-cost _RARE_ with more _RARE_ contours and with superior properties to _RARE_ foam . STO
* The _RARE_ urethane foam is generally produced with _RARE_ acid _RARE_ ; ; the polyether group generally consists of foams produced with _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ modified with a _RARE_ . STO
* One shot _RARE_ _RARE_ In the _RARE_ system , the _RARE_ and _RARE_ are mixed _RARE_ and no foaming occurs . STO
* The foaming can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of _RARE_ in solution . STO
* In one-shot , the _RARE_ , _RARE_ or polyether _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and other _RARE_ are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately . STO
* _RARE_ , this means that simpler processing equipment ( the mixture has good flowing characteristics ) and less external heat ( the foaming reaction is _RARE_ and _RARE_ internal heat ) are required in one-shot foaming , although , at the same time , the problems of controlling the conditions of one-shot foaming are critical ones . STO
* Properties Most commercial uses of urethane foams require _RARE_ between 2 and 30 lb.  cu. ft. for rigid foams , between 1 and 3 lb.  cu. ft. for flexible foams . STO
* This latter figure _RARE_ with _RARE_ foam rubber at an average of _RARE_ lb.  cu. ft. in commercial grades . STO
* _RARE_ strength : _RARE_ in Fig. 1 , p. _RARE_ , indicates how the ratio of _RARE_ strength to density varies as the latter is increased or decreased . STO
* The single curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example . STO
* By varying the formula , this curve may be moved forward or backward along the _RARE_ to produce any desired _RARE_ strength  density ratio . STO
* _RARE_ conductivity and temperature resistance : In flexible urethane foams , we are referring to the range between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the _RARE_ primary performance remains _RARE_ useful . STO
* In temperature resistance , this quality is usually related to specific properties , e.g. , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , etc. . STO
* _RARE_ conductivity is directly _RARE_ to the _RARE_ porous , _RARE_ construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the _RARE_ of minute bubbles which form its composition . STO
* These air or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal barriers . STO
* The K factor , a term used to _RARE_ the rate of heat transmission through a material ( _RARE_ ft. of _RARE_ of thickness ) _RARE_ from _RARE_ to _RARE_ for flexible urethane foams and from _RARE_ to _RARE_ for rigid urethane foams , depending upon the formulation , density , cell size , and nature of blowing agents used . STO
* Table 1 , , p. _RARE_ , shows a comparison of K factor ratings of a number of commercial _RARE_ materials in common use , including two different types of rigid urethane foam . STO
* _RARE_ strength : This term refers to the ability of a material to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by bending . STO
* The _RARE_ urethane _RARE_ foams usually have stronger _RARE_ fatigue resistance , i.e. , the 12 lb.  cu. ft. foam has 8 times the _RARE_ strength of the 3 lb.  cu. ft. density . STO
* Note that _RARE_ strength is not always improved by simply increasing the density , nor is the change always proportional from one formulation to another . STO
* Where _RARE_ strength is an important factor , be sure that your urethane foam _RARE_ is aware of it . STO
* _RARE_ strength : This property refers to the greatest _RARE_ stress or tension a material can _RARE_ without tearing apart . STO
* ( like _RARE_ strength of urethane foams , it has a direct relationship to formulation . STO
* ) _RARE_ _RARE_ strength is another of urethane _RARE_ strong features . STO
* Figure 2 , above , shows the _RARE_ properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change in _RARE_ strength during exposure to _RARE_ light . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ There are many ways of producing a foamed urethane product . STO
* The foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape , it can be _RARE_ , it can be _RARE_ , it can be applied by spray guns , etc. . STO
* _RARE_ stock is still one of the most important forms of urethane _RARE_ in use today . STO
* _RARE_ , the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more _RARE_ units , a variable _RARE_ , a _RARE_ carriage assembly , and , in many cases , a _RARE_ belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it _RARE_ into foam . STO
* The _RARE_ are fed from tanks through a hose and into the _RARE_ at a _RARE_ rate . STO
* The mixing head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the _RARE_ . STO
* It only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed and after a short cure , the material can be cut into lengths as desired . STO
* Much has been done in the way of ingenious _RARE_ to _RARE_ the slab stock into finished products . STO
* Profile cutting machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and other _RARE_ in variable heights , dimensions , etc. . STO
* The _RARE_ sheets can be combined to attain certain _RARE_ effects _RARE_ rather than _RARE_ . STO
* Also available is a _RARE_ which `` _RARE_ '' the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 _RARE_ in length , down to _RARE_ _RARE_ thick . STO
* The low cost and ease of _RARE_ of the _RARE_ for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes , dimensions , and contours that can be _RARE_ to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case _RARE_ , materials handling _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ devices , and such _RARE_ as soap dishes , _RARE_ , head rests , _RARE_ supports , and gas _RARE_ covers . STO
* _RARE_ Although slab stock appeared first , it soon became apparent that for the production of _RARE_ with irregular shapes , _RARE_ contours , or rounded edges , the cutting of slab stock is a _RARE_ and _RARE_ process . STO
* Only by _RARE_ to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market . STO
* The closed molding of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction of the material ( molding in open _RARE_ was more feasible ) . STO
* _RARE_ methods for _RARE_ foams and even _RARE_ polyether foams were never fully achieved . STO
* _RARE_ molding generally resulted in parts _RARE_ more ( because of higher density ) than parts _RARE_ from _RARE_ foams . STO
* This _RARE_ the gain from having no scrap loss . STO
* In addition , there were difficulties with the flow and spreading of the foam mixture over the mold surface , trouble with lack of _RARE_ strength in the rising foam , and problems of _RARE_ . STO
* The introduction of one-shot polyether foam systems , aided by the development of new _RARE_ , helped to _RARE_ some of the problems of closed molding . STO
* While there are still many _RARE_ to be _RARE_ out , the technique is fast developing . STO
* Other techniques _RARE_ systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured , _RARE_ , etc. , into a void where they foam up to fill the void . STO
* In a typical application -- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels -- an amount of foam mixture calculated to _RARE_ 10 to _RARE_ more than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top of the panel is locked in place by a _RARE_ . STO
* Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - _RARE_ ( 29 - _RARE_ ) . STO
* The top rolls are loaded with 40 _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ loading is possible but 40 _RARE_ is adequate . STO
* The suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started . STO
* The _RARE_ bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen . STO
* _RARE_ is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 _RARE_ or passes through the _RARE_ rolls . STO
* At the conclusion of the washing , 8 _RARE_ of water at _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) are automatically _RARE_ from the rinse reservoir to the washing _RARE_ , 4 _RARE_ to each tub . STO
* This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes . STO
* During the _RARE_ operation the volume in the _RARE_ gradually increases until _RARE_ from the main drain begins . STO
* At this point the _RARE_ are _RARE_ so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the _RARE_ mark on the drain gauge . STO
* When all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the _RARE_ the main _RARE_ are lowered to permit complete _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* The run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line . STO
* By this procedure _RARE_ _RARE_ in two stages , first by dilution until the time when the _RARE_ are separated and thereafter by displacement of the _RARE_ liquor by clean rinse water , since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the _RARE_ passes directly to waste from the suds box _RARE_ . STO
* This method of _RARE_ appears to produce maximum _RARE_ with minimum soil _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ evaluation and classification _RARE_ may be made on either a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ basis as desired . STO
* A _RARE_ instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning , whereas _RARE_ _RARE_ is necessary to measure grease removal . STO
* _RARE_ and scope This test method is intended for determining the dimensional changes of _RARE_ or knitted fabrics , made of fibers other than wool , to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home . STO
* Four washing test procedures are established , varying in _RARE_ from very severe to very mild , and are intended to cover the range of practical washing from commercial procedure to hand washing . STO
* Five drying test procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques used in the home and commercial laundry . STO
* Three methods for determining the dimensional _RARE_ characteristics are established for those textiles which require restoration by _RARE_ or wearing after laundering . STO
* These tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate dimensional changes after repeated _RARE_ . STO
* Table 1 , _RARE_ all of the various washing , drying , and restoration procedures available . STO
* The person using these tests must determine which combination of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or _RARE_ after laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry . STO
* It is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a _RARE_ consisting of a Roman _RARE_ , a letter , and an _RARE_ number . STO
* For example Test 3 , E 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed by procedure `` 3 ( '' ( at _RARE_ ) for a total of 60 minutes in the machine , has been dried in a _RARE_ _RARE_ by procedure `` E '' and has been subjected to restorative forces on the _RARE_ _RARE_ by procedure `` 1 '' . STO

* Any _RARE_ press capable of pressing a specimen 22 inches square may be used as an alternative . STO
* The _RARE_ press is maintained at a temperature not less than _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* _RARE_ -- _RARE_ of the rotary _RARE_ type , having a cylindrical basket approximately 30 inches in diameter and 24 inches in length and rotating at approximately 35 _RARE_ . STO

* _RARE_ of weights are provided so that the load can be selected in the range of 12 to 4 pounds . STO
* A _RARE_ aluminum plate , used to provide the drying surface , is heated by means of a _RARE_ . STO

* The surface of the apparatus in contact with the test specimen is _RARE_ and polished so as to be as _RARE_ as possible . STO
* Test specimens The preparation of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional _RARE_ procedure ( if any ) to be used . STO
* Three specimens for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory average of performance . STO
* This is especially true for knitted fabrics . STO
* _RARE_ are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with a standard atmosphere of Af and Af and then laid out without tension on a flat , polished surface , care being taken that the fabric is free from _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ that are badly distorted in their _RARE_ state due to _RARE_ _RARE_ may give _RARE_ dimensional change results when _RARE_ by any procedure . STO
* This also holds true if restorative forces are applied . STO
* Therefore , it is recommended that in such cases the sample be replaced , or if used , the results of dimensional change or dimensional _RARE_ tests be considered as _RARE_ only . STO
* _RARE_ , it is necessary to mark distances on a specimen ( or garment ) in both _RARE_ and _RARE_ directions and to measure before and after laundering . STO

STO

* _RARE_ the machine to a level of Af inches with water at 100 - _RARE_ ( ( 38 - _RARE_ C. ) and start the machine . STO
* _RARE_ steam , if necessary , to reach the temperature shown in Column D of Table 2 . STO
* Again stop the machine at the end of the time shown in Column C of Table 2 . STO
* This procedure is repeated for the second rinse , using the temperatures and time shown in _RARE_ F and E of Table 2 . STO
* _RARE_ 2 , 3 , , , and 4 . STO

* When this water level has been reached , _RARE_ steam until the temperature is that shown in Column Aj . STO
* _RARE_ off the water at such a time that the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end of the sum of the times shown in _RARE_ A and C , measured from the time the wash wheel was started . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ to a level of Af inches with water at 100 - _RARE_ ( 38 - _RARE_ ) . STO
* When this water level has been reached _RARE_ steam until the temperature is that shown in Column Aj . STO

* _RARE_ , _RARE_ image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a _RARE_ or recording instrument exceeds the limits of _RARE_ . STO
* Examples of such situations are ( _RARE_ ) night _RARE_ , the recording of radioactive _RARE_ in live body tissues , special _RARE_ in medical or industrial applications , track recording of high energy particles , etc. . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) _RARE_ single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) _RARE_ , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) _RARE_ intensifier based upon the `` _RARE_ '' principle , ( D ) _RARE_ secondary electron _RARE_ image intensifiers ( _RARE_ tubes ) , ( E ) _RARE_ of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope . STO
* _RARE_ single stages by coupling lens systems is rather _RARE_ as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely . STO
* _RARE_ image intensifiers are capable of achieving _RARE_ values ; ; they suffer , however , from an _RARE_ low resolution . STO
* _RARE_ intensifiers based upon the _RARE_ principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned . STO
* However , the _RARE_ _RARE_ cycle _RARE_ the effective gain . STO
* _RARE_ tubes have been constructed showing high gain and resolution . STO
* However , electrostatic focus , important for many applications , has not been realized for these devices . STO
* _RARE_ limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to chromatic aberrations . STO
* Furthermore , the thin film _RARE_ appear to have a natural diameter _RARE_ wherever a _RARE_ support cannot be _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ single stages enclosed by a common envelope have been constructed with high gain and high resolution . STO
* These tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members . STO
* The electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one . STO
* The magnification may be smaller , equal , or larger than unity . STO
* An electrostatic system _RARE_ generally from image plane curvature leading to _RARE_ in the peripheral image region if a flat _RARE_ screen ( or _RARE_ coupler ) is utilized , while a magnetic system requires accurate adjustment of the _RARE_ , which is heavy and bulky . STO
* As it will be discussed later , peripheral _RARE_ can be improved on by _RARE_ curved fiber _RARE_ . STO
* It should be noted , however , that the _RARE_ resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems . STO
* It is felt that _RARE_ _RARE_ ( and _RARE_ ) stage image intensifiers will gain considerable importance in the future . STO
* Therefore , we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such tubes . STO
* The luminous efficiency and resolution of single stages , fiber _RARE_ , and finally of the composite tube will be computed . STO
* It will be shown _RARE_ that the high image intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact _RARE_ permits the utilization of extremely low incident light levels . STO
* The effect of device and quantum noise , associated with such low input levels , will be described . STO
* After these theoretical considerations , _RARE_ details of a _RARE_ , _RARE_ X-ray image intensifier will be discussed . STO
* _RARE_ performance characteristics for this experimental tube will be listed . STO
* The conclusion shall be reached that _RARE_ , _RARE_ tubes represent a sensible and practical approach to _RARE_ image intensification . STO
* Basic design of a _RARE_ , _RARE_ image intensifier The tube design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be described now . STO
* The electron optical system ( see fig. _RARE_ ) is based in principle on the focusing action of _RARE_ spherical cathode and anode surfaces . STO
* The inner ( anode ) sphere is _RARE_ , _RARE_ into a cup , and _RARE_ by the phosphor screen . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ from a circular _RARE_ of the cathode sphere are focused by the positive lens action of the two _RARE_ _RARE_ , pass through the ( negative ) lens formed by the anode aperture , and _RARE_ upon the _RARE_ _RARE_ screen . STO
* The cylindrical focusing electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the focusing potential . STO
* The anode potential _RARE_ the gain , G , and magnification , M , of the stage . STO
* Both the photocathode and the image plane of such an electrode _RARE_ are curved _RARE_ as seen from the anode aperture . STO
* The _RARE_ property of the _RARE_ fiber coupler can be utilized to _RARE_ the peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat _RARE_ or coupling member . STO
* For the same reason , the output fiber plate is _RARE_ , its exposed flat side _RARE_ contact _RARE_ if a permanent record is desired . STO
* As it will be shown later , the _RARE_ properties of the _RARE_ and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design . STO
* The second photocathode and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate _RARE_ . STO
* The photocathode _RARE_ S , phosphor _RARE_ P , and anode _RARE_ V of the individual stages shall be distinguished by means of _RARE_ 1 , and 2 , in the text , where required . STO
* Both stages are assumed to have unity magnification . STO
* _RARE_ discussion of flux gain flux gain of a single stage The luminous gain of a single stage with Af ( flux gain ) is , to a first approximation , given by the product of the photocathode sensitivity S ( _RARE_  _RARE_ ) , the anode potential V ( _RARE_ ) , and the phosphor conversion efficiency P ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* In general , P is a function of V and the current density , but it shall here be assumed as a constant . STO
* The luminous efficiency Af of a photocathode depends on the maximum _RARE_ sensitivity Af and on the spectral distribution of the incident light Af by the relation : Af where Af is _RARE_ _RARE_ photocathode sensitivity . STO
* Af is standard _RARE_ function . STO
* The luminous flux gain of a single stage is given by : Af . STO
* If the input light distribution falls beyond the visible range , Af as expected , since Af . STO
* Such cases are not considered here . STO
* _RARE_ of fiber _RARE_ The efficiency of fiber _RARE_ plates depends on four factors : ( A ) numerical aperture ( _RARE_ ) ; ; ( B ) end ( _RARE_ reflection ) losses ( R ) ; ; ( C ) internal losses ( _RARE_ ) ; ; ( D ) packing efficiency ( _RARE_ ) . STO
* The numerical aperture of the fibers is given by : Af where Af . STO
* The angle Af is measured in the medium of index Af . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , as generally used in image intensifiers , have low optical contact with the substrate surface , hence Af shall be assumed . STO
* The numerical aperture should be in general close to unity . STO
* This condition can be satisfied , e.g. , with Af and Af or equivalent glass combinations . STO
* A sufficiently good approximation for determining the end reflection losses R can be obtained from the angle independent _RARE_ formula : Af . STO
* For phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces , and assuming Af , we obtain Af percent . STO
* This value may be reduced to _RARE_ percent by means of a ( very thin ) glass layer of index 1.5 . STO
* Hence , the Af factor for the output fiber coupler is Af . STO
* As the index of _RARE_ of _RARE_ surfaces of the _RARE_ lies around 2 , the _RARE_ losses at the _RARE_ _RARE_ are about 0.5 percent and the Af factor for the _RARE_ coupler is _RARE_ . STO
* It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further . STO
* The internal losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal _RARE_ due to _RARE_ from the prescribed , cylindrical fiber _RARE_ and minute _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* These losses depend on fiber diameter and length , absorption _RARE_ , the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last , but not least , on the angular distribution of the incident light . STO
* _RARE_ expressions ( integral averages ) are given in the literature . STO
* _RARE_ reliable data for some of the variables , we are _RARE_ on experimental data of about 20 percent internal losses for _RARE_ long , small ( 5 - 10 M ) diameter fibers . STO
* This relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber _RARE_ increasing the number of internal _RARE_ . STO
* Since we are considering here relatively small diameter ( 1 - 1.5 inches ) fiber plates , their average thickness can be kept below 14 inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent ( per plate ) . STO
* The packing efficiency , _RARE_ , of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature , probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used , until rather recently . STO
* For circular fibers in a closely packed _RARE_ _RARE_ , the packing efficiency is given by : Af where Af , and _RARE_ is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* For the small diameter fibers now _RARE_ feasible and required for about 100 Af resolution , Af . STO
* The _RARE_ thickness is about 0.5 M , hence , Af and Af . STO
* Thus , the efficiency _RARE_ _RARE_ is given by -- Af or approximately 50 percent each . STO
* It must be remembered that the fiber plates replace a glass window and a ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ , in addition to an optical output lens system . STO
* The efficiency Af of an Af lens at the magnification Af is : Af . STO
* _RARE_ absorption , the end losses of the coupling _RARE_ and the output window Af would be 6 percent and 8 percent . STO
* Thus , the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two fiber plates ( with a combined efficiency of _RARE_ ) is _RARE_ or about six times less than that of the two fiber plates . STO
* _RARE_ of fiber coupled image intensifiers _RARE_ the brightness gain Af due to the Af area _RARE_ , the overall gain of a fiber coupled double stage image intensifier is : Af . STO
* It is obvious that the careful choice of photocathode which _RARE_ Af for a given input E ( in the case of the second stage , for the first phosphor screen emission ) is very important . STO
* The same consideration should govern the choice of the _RARE_ phosphor screen for matching with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate _RARE_ ( e.g. , photographic _RARE_ ) . STO
* We have evaluated the `` matching _RARE_ '' for two types of _RARE_ ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ ) and three types of light input . STO
* The input light distributions considered are _RARE_ and _RARE_ phosphor emission and the so-called `` night light '' ( _RARE_ ) as given by _RARE_ _RARE_ and J. J. Johnson . STO
* The _RARE_ ( in units ) are listed in table _RARE_ , below . STO
* _RARE_ discussion of _RARE_ device resolution resolution limitations in a single stage The resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the _RARE_ _RARE_ screen . STO
* The resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations . STO
* It has been stated previously that a _RARE_ electrostatic system _RARE_ a lower resolution than a _RARE_ system or a system with unity magnification . STO
* Furthermore , the chromatic aberrations depend on the chosen high voltage . STO
* In general , a high anode voltage _RARE_ chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution . STO
* The luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from _RARE_ ( 6 ) for the 16 possible combinations of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ phosphor screens , for night light and _RARE_ light input . STO
* ( The _RARE_ input is of interest because it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional X-ray _RARE_ screens ) . STO
* The following _RARE_ obtained from _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ were used : Af . STO
* The following table ( _RARE_ ) lists the ( luminous ) gain values computed according to _RARE_ ( 6 ) with Af . STO
* The possibility of a space charge _RARE_ of the screen _RARE_ of the elementary electron _RARE_ has been pointed out . STO
* It is obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output levels . STO
* Space charge influences will also decrease at increased _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ systems of the _RARE_ type have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying _RARE_ . STO
* A resolution of 70 - 80 _RARE_ per _RARE_ appears to be feasible . STO
* The inherent resolution of a _RARE_ phosphor screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness ( with increasing anode voltage ) , decreases with decreasing _RARE_ ( thus the advantage of _RARE_ phosphor _RARE_ ) and might be _RARE_ by the normally used aluminum mirror . STO
* Thus , in general , elementary light optical effects , light _RARE_ , and electron _RARE_ determine the obtainable resolution limit . STO
* It should be noted that _RARE_ , due to `` _RARE_ '' generated within the _RARE_ screen by electron impact , appears to be important only if anode _RARE_ in excess of 30 _RARE_ are utilized . STO
* It has been stated that settled _RARE_ phosphor screens may have a _RARE_ resolution of 60 Af at high voltage values of approximately 20 Aj . STO
* For the further discussion , we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 Af and phosphor screen resolution of 60 Af . STO
* The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . STO
* An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by _RARE_ the value of the product . STO
* There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The _RARE_ of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The _RARE_ of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The _RARE_ of the objective function of which the _RARE_ is desired . STO
* For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . STO
* For the second we might have to choose the volume of _RARE_ or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . STO
* The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . STO
* The essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no _RARE_ was first isolated by _RARE_ . STO
* He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal _RARE_ policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of _RARE_ the complete process . STO
* Moreover , by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal _RARE_ policy for the remaining stages , we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all R stages . STO
* _RARE_ in this way , from one to two and from two to three stages , we may gradually build up the policy for any number . STO
* At each step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied . STO
* To see how important this economy is , let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables ; ; then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order Af ( where a is some number not _RARE_ large ) . STO
* To proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for _RARE_ ; ; this number will be of the order of Af . STO
* If , however , we are seeking the optimal R-stage policy for a given feed state , only one search for a maximum is required at the final step . STO
* Thus a number of operations of the order of Af are required . STO
* If all the operating variables were varied simultaneously , Af operations would be required to do the same job , and as R increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program . STO
* But even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy , namely , that for the given feed state and R stages . STO
* In contrast , the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages . STO
* If the problem is _RARE_ to require a complete coverage of feed states , Af operations are needed by the dynamic program and Af by the direct search . STO
* But Af is vastly larger than R . STO
* No optimism is more _RARE_ than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital _RARE_ allows for use of the _RARE_ of methods in searching out a result . STO
* Suppose that Af , and that the average operation requires only Af _RARE_ . STO
* Then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three _RARE_ ! STO
* The principle of optimality thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a _RARE_ decision process . STO
* _RARE_ ( 1957 ) has _RARE_ in the following terms : `` An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are , the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision '' . STO
* This is the principle which we will _RARE_ in every case to set up a functional equation . STO
* It appears in a form that is _RARE_ suited to the powers of the digital computer . STO
* At the same time , every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value , and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic _RARE_ that room is left for _RARE_ in using the special features of the problem to this end . STO
* _RARE_ the discrete deterministic process Consider the process illustrated in Fig. _RARE_ , consisting of R distinct stages . STO
* These will be _RARE_ in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream , so that stage R is the T stage from the end . STO
* Let the state of the stream leaving stage R be denoted by a vector Af and the operating variables of stage R by Af . STO
* Thus Af denotes the state of the feed to the R-stage process , and Af the state of the product from the last stage . STO
* Each stage _RARE_ the state Af of its feed to the state Af in a way that depends on the operating variables Af . STO
* We write this Af . STO
* This transformation is uniquely determined by Af and we therefore speak of the process as deterministic . STO
* In practical situations there will be restrictions on the admissible operating conditions , and we regard the vectors as belonging to a fixed and bounded set S . STO
* The set of vectors Af constitutes the operating policy or , more briefly , the policy , and a policy is admissible if all the Af belong to S . STO
* When the policy has been chosen , the state of the product can be obtained from the state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation ( 1 ) ; ; thus Af . STO
* The objective function , which is to be _RARE_ , is some function , usually _RARE_ continuous , of the product state . STO
* Let this be denoted by Af . STO
* An optimal policy is an admissible policy Af which _RARE_ the objective function P . STO
* The policy may not be unique but the maximum value of P certainly is , and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) as a function of the feed state Af . STO
* Let Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af . STO
* When it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af . STO
* For any choice of admissible policy Af in the first stage , the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by Af . STO
* This is the feed state of the subsequent Af stages which , according to the principle of optimality , must use an optimal _RARE_ policy with respect to this state . STO
* This will result in a value Af of the objective function , and when Af is chosen correctly this will give Af , the maximum of the objective function . STO
* Thus Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af , and Af is related to Af by ( 5 ) . STO
* The sequence of equations ( 6 ) can be solved for Af when Af is known , and clearly Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af . STO
* The set of equations ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and the starting equation ( 7 ) is of a _RARE_ type well suited to _RARE_ on the digital computer . STO
* In finding the optimal R-stage policy from that of Af stages , only the function Af is needed . STO
* When Af has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of Af and the whole calculation repeated . STO
* We also see how the results may be presented , although if _RARE_ , the number of state variables , is large any _RARE_ will become _RARE_ . STO
* A table or set of tables may be set out as in Table _RARE_ . STO
* To _RARE_ the optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af , we enter section R of this table at the state Af and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function . STO
* In the third column is given the optimal policy for stage R , and in the fourth , the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used . STO
* Since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an optimal _RARE_ policy with respect to Af , we may enter section Af of the table at this state Af and read off the optimal policy for stage Af and the resulting state Af . STO
* _RARE_ in this way up the table we _RARE_ the complete optimal policy and , if it is desired , we can check on Af by evaluating Af at the last stage . STO
* It may be that the objective function depends not only on Af but also on Af , as when the cost of the operating policy is considered . STO
* A _RARE_ reflection shows that the above _RARE_ and presentation work equally well in this case . STO
* A form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is Af . STO
* Here P represents the value of the stream in state P and Q the cost of operating the stage with conditions Q . STO
* Hence P is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation , that is , the net profit . STO
* If Af denotes the net profit from stage R and Af , then the principle of optimality gives Af . STO
* This sequence of equations may be started with the remark that with no process Af there is no profit , i.e. , Af . STO
* _RARE_ the discrete _RARE_ process The process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only _RARE_ is also of interest , although for chemical _RARE_ design it is not as important as the deterministic process . STO
* In this case the stage R operating with conditions Af _RARE_ the state of the stream from Af to Af , but only the probability distribution of Af is known . STO
* This is specified by a distribution function Af such that the probability that Af lies in some region D of the stage space is Af . STO
* We cannot now speak of _RARE_ the value of the objective function , since this function is now known only in a _RARE_ sense . STO
* We can , however , _RARE_ its expected value . STO
* For a single stage we may define Af where the maximization is by choice of Af . STO
* We thus have an optimal policy which _RARE_ the expected value of the objective function for a given Af . STO
* If we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next , then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first . STO
* Then Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af and the integration over the whole of stage space . STO
* The type of presentation of results used in the deterministic process may be used here , except that now the fourth column is _RARE_ . STO
* The third column gives the optimal policy , but we must wait to see the outcome of stage R and enter the preceding section of the table at this state . STO
* The discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter . STO
* _RARE_ the continuous deterministic process In many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages , since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process . STO
* We replace _RARE_ , the number of the stage from the end of the process , by t , a continuous variable which measures the `` distance '' of the point considered from the end of the process . STO
* The word distance is used here in a rather general sense ; ; it may in fact be the time that will _RARE_ before the end of the process . STO
* If T is the total `` length '' of the process , its feed state may be denoted by a vector _RARE_ and the product state by _RARE_ . STO
* P denotes the state at any point T and Q the vector of operating variables there . STO
* A gyro-stabilized platform system , using _RARE_ gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the _RARE_ combination . STO
* The _RARE_ gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , _RARE_ _RARE_ effects , as follows : Af where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro . STO
* The platform angle **yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling . STO
* This is normally termed the gyro input axis , _RARE_ away from the gyro output or _RARE_ axis . STO
* The gyro angular momentum is defined by H . STO
* Thus if the gyro and _RARE_ combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the **yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Af if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Aj . STO
* It is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical _RARE_ so that a torque can be applied about their output axes . STO
* In the system shown in Fig. 7-1 , the accelerometer output is _RARE_ and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro _RARE_ torquer . STO
* This torque causes the entire system to _RARE_ about the **yf axis , since the response to Af . STO
* If the _RARE_ are correct , the platform _RARE_ in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero . STO
* As the accelerometer output is decreasing , the torque applied to the gyro output axis decreases and , therefore , the rate decreases . STO
* Finally , when the accelerometer output is zero , the entire system remains _RARE_ , and the platform is , by definition , leveled . STO
* A mathematical block _RARE_ for the leveling system is shown in Fig. _RARE_ . STO
* The platform is initially off level by the angle Aj . STO
* The angle generated by the platform servo **yf _RARE_ by G is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer . STO
* Af is the scale factor of the accelerometer ( Af ) . STO
* The voltage Af is _RARE_ by Af and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor Af . STO
* Finally , the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by Af . STO
* The system as indicated in Fig. _RARE_ is fundamental and simple because the _RARE_ effects of both the platform servo and the accelerometer have been neglected . STO
* With these factors included , an upper limit is placed on the _RARE_ loop gain by stability considerations . STO
* In this type of system , a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time . STO
* When the frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered , their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain . STO
* The time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain . STO
* In addition , the _RARE_ frequency for input _RARE_ is approximately proportional to the servo loop gain ; ; i.e. , high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of _RARE_ . STO
* This problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time . STO
* It must be noticed in Fig. 7-1 that the accelerometer _RARE_ to any input acceleration . STO
* The equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af . STO
* In practice , the _RARE_ leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the _RARE_ . STO
* When the system is arranged for automatic leveling , the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers . STO
* There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind _RARE_ , engine noise , _RARE_ around the vehicle , etc. . STO
* One of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of _RARE_ acceleration noise . STO
* One solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* This technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform _RARE_ . STO
* Since a lower loop gain and _RARE_ _RARE_ increases the response time , a practical _RARE_ must be reached . STO
* One of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a _RARE_ amplifier for Af . STO
* The amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level . STO
* Below this level , the amplifier gain Af is proportional and is of small value , in order to provide adequate noise _RARE_ . STO
* The effect is that the platform returns from an _RARE_ position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level , at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process . STO
* When the system is on automatic leveling , the gyro drift is canceled by the output of the leveling system ( amplifier Af ) . STO
* The platform actually _RARE_ off level so that the accelerometer output , when _RARE_ by Af , will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift . STO
* The amount of platform _RARE_ required depends upon the scale factors of the system . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ leveling considerations . STO
* The automatic leveling system described in this section is readily _RARE_ to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three _RARE_ gyros . STO
* The system requires some _RARE_ of flight equipment _RARE_ . STO
* However , the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled _RARE_ with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform . STO
* This leveling system will hold the platform _RARE_ , automatically , as long as the system is _RARE_ . STO
* A useful _RARE_ of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift _RARE_ is available from the _RARE_ necessary to hold the system in level . STO
* The leveling process can be accomplished _RARE_ , and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment . STO
* The process consists in turning the platform _RARE_ until the _RARE_ of both accelerometers are zero . STO
* The turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro _RARE_ described above . STO
* In brief , the human replaces amplifier Af in Figs. 7-1 and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer _RARE_ . STO
* If high accuracy is required in _RARE_ leveling , it is usually necessary to _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ the accelerometer _RARE_ ( this also _RARE_ the noise problem ) . STO
* With integration , the effect of a small acceleration ( or small platform _RARE_ angle ) can be seen after a time . STO
* However , skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy . STO
* Also , it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach . STO
* _RARE_ leveling is _RARE_ if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time . STO
* The operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro _RARE_ so that the effect of gyro drift is canceled . STO
* This process is especially difficult since gyro _RARE_ is _RARE_ random . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ heading . STO
* _RARE_ heading consists of _RARE_ the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the _RARE_ . STO
* In simpler terms , it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction . STO
* For purely _RARE_ _RARE_ , two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading : Use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading ; ; Use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading . STO
* The choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements , field conditions , and the time available to accomplish the heading . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ determination of heading -- surveying technique . STO
* With the gyro-stabilized platform leveled , it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques . STO
* The platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure . STO
* Before the accelerometers are mounted on the platform , the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined . STO
* A mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is _RARE_ to the sensitive axis of the unit . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north . STO
* This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques . STO
* With the transit set up , a mirror on one of the accelerometers is _RARE_ and the platform is turned until it is aligned . STO
* The _RARE_ procedure includes the use of a _RARE_ for the transit to project a beam of light , which is darkened by crossed hairs , on the accelerometer mirror . STO
* When the platform is aligned , the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly _RARE_ upon the original crossed hairs . STO
* The images can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy . STO
* The platform is turned as required by supplying _RARE_ to the appropriate gyro _RARE_ . STO
* Although this technique is simple and satisfactory , one practical difficulty does exist : the direction of true north must be known for each _RARE_ point . STO
* However , this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few _RARE_ work . STO
* In many installations , the _RARE_ platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight . STO
* With this situation , it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment . STO
* If the platform is not too high off the ground , a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform . STO
* Obviously , the heading accuracy is _RARE_ by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* The transit can be replaced by an _RARE_ . STO
* This instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular _RARE_ of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading . STO
* The electrical signal from the _RARE_ is _RARE_ and supplied to the _RARE_ torquer . STO
* If the _RARE_ is correct , the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero . STO
* _RARE_ is also available from this _RARE_ system to set the drift bias for the _RARE_ gyro . STO
* If the _RARE_ gyro is _RARE_ , a current generated by the _RARE_ is delivered to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift . STO
* If the drift error is systematic , it can be canceled with a bias _RARE_ which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required _RARE_ current . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It is possible to locate an angular electrical _RARE_ , which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform . STO
* _RARE_ , the _RARE_ or reference portion of the _RARE_ is established with respect to the true heading direction , and the platform is turned either _RARE_ or automatically until the angular electrical _RARE_ signal is reduced to zero . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ heading . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading . STO
* For the case of a purely _RARE_ _RARE_ consisting of three _RARE_ gyros , a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the X accelerometer is parallel to the _RARE_ direction at the base point , and the _RARE_ accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the _RARE_ direction at the base point . STO
* The accelerometers are mounted _RARE_ on the platform . STO
* Thus , if one accelerometer is properly aligned , the other is also . STO
* The input axis of the appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers . STO
* Figure _RARE_ shows a platform system with the gyro vectors arranged as described above . STO
* The platform is leveled and properly headed , so that the _RARE_ input axis is parallel to the _RARE_ direction and the _RARE_ input axis is parallel to the _RARE_ direction . STO
* The input axis of the X gyro , when pointing in the _RARE_ direction , is always _RARE_ to the spin axis of earth . STO
* If the platform is not properly headed , the _RARE_ input axis will see a component of the _RARE_ rotation . STO
* The sensing of this rotation by the X gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading . STO
* In Fig. _RARE_ , the input axis of the _RARE_ platform is shown at some point on the earth . STO
* The point is at a _RARE_ **yl , and the platform is at an error in heading east . STO
* The earth is spinning at an angular velocity _RARE_ equal to one revolution per 24 _RARE_ . STO
* When the platform is level , _RARE_ is a rotation about the _RARE_ axis of the platform Af . STO
* Since the earth is rotating and the _RARE_ gyro-stabilized platform is fixed with respect to a reference in space , an observer on the earth will see the platform rotating ( with respect to the earth ) . STO
* _RARE_ Scotty did not go back to school . STO
* His parents talked seriously and _RARE_ to their own doctor and to a _RARE_ at the University Hospital -- Mr. McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family -- and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty much as he chose -- provided , of course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too _RARE_ . STO
* His teacher and his school principal were _RARE_ with and everyone agreed that , if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little danger of his losing a term . STO
* Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments . STO
* He was discharged from the hospital after a _RARE_ _RARE_ and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley described as a `` celebration lunch '' at the _RARE_ on the campus . STO
* Rachel wore a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , _RARE_ at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with _RARE_ . STO
* Scotty's father sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a _RARE_ , looking about at the huge _RARE_ _RARE_ of the room with an expression of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ -- men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles -- came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel . STO
* Rachel was _RARE_ , Scotty indifferent . STO
* They ate the _RARE_ food with its orange _RARE_ and Scotty gazed without interest at his food , the teachers , the heroic _RARE_ windows , and the bright ranks of college _RARE_ . STO
* His father tried to make the food a _RARE_ . STO
* `` The _RARE_ pie is good , Scotty . STO
* I recommend it '' . STO
* He looked at his son , his face worried . STO
* Scotty murmured , `` No , thanks '' , so softly his father had to bend his _RARE_ height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him . STO
* Scotty regarded the ear and the _RARE_ hair around it with a moment of interest . STO
* He said more loudly , `` I'm full , old _RARE_ '' . STO
* He had eaten almost nothing on the _RARE_ , _RARE_ plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper container . STO
* `` He's all right , _RARE_ '' , Rachel said . STO
* `` I can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home '' . STO
* Since his _RARE_ , Scotty had had little appetite ; ; yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , was one of _RARE_ . STO
* His face was _RARE_ ; ; his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become _RARE_ . STO
* He breathed now with his mouth open , showing a _RARE_ _RARE_ section of lower teeth ; ; he kept his eyes , with their _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , always lowered , though not , apparently , focusing . STO
* Even his neck seemed _RARE_ and , therefore , shorter . STO
* His hands , which had been as quick as a pair of _RARE_ birds , were now neither active nor really relaxed . STO
* They lay on his lap , palms up , stiffly motionless , the _RARE_ fingers a little thick at the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ he had , since the _RARE_ , the appearance of a boy who _RARE_ in food and took no exercise . STO
* He looked lazy , spoiled , a little _RARE_ . STO
* Rachel had little to say . STO
* She greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling _RARE_ , offering nothing . STO
* Mr. McKinley , for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity , was completely alert to his son , eyes always on the still face , jumping to _RARE_ Scotty's desires . STO
* It was a strained , silent lunch . STO
* Rachel said , `` I'd better get him to bed '' . STO
* The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger . STO
* Since Mr. McKinley had to give a lecture , Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth . STO
* They did not speak much . STO
* Scotty gazed out at ugly gray _RARE_ and said softly , `` Look at those stupid kids '' . STO
* It was a Negro section of peeling row houses , _RARE_ churches and ragged children . STO
* Rachel had to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat . STO
* He said , `` Nothing '' . STO
* And then : `` There are lots of kids around here '' . STO
* Scotty looked at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull . STO
* He felt tired and full and calm . STO
* _RARE_ the days seemed short , perhaps because his routine was , each day , almost the same . STO
* He rose late and went down in his _RARE_ and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel . STO
* Virginia treated him with attention and tried to _RARE_ his appetite with special food : biscuits , _RARE_ , _RARE_ -- the result of devoted hours in the _RARE_ kitchen . STO
* She would _RARE_ over him and , looking like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of Scotty's fork or _RARE_ . STO
* `` You don't eat enough , honey . STO
* Try to get that down '' . STO
* Rachel , observing , would say , `` He has to _RARE_ his own capacity . STO
* It'll take time '' . STO
* Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now , as _RARE_ who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere . STO
* Both watched Scotty constantly , Rachel without seeming to , Virginia openly , her eyes filled with concern . STO
* Scotty was neutral . STO
* He did not _RARE_ their supervision or _RARE_ sometimes _RARE_ sympathy . STO
* He ate what he felt like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the _RARE_ rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow , _RARE_ steps , like an elderly tourist in a _RARE_ . STO
* His energy was gone . STO
* He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving . STO
* His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly -- they were like wax hands : almost _RARE_ , not quite -- folded in his lap ; ; his mouth hung slightly open . STO
* When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was _RARE_ , he would answer ; ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder . STO
* He had not mentioned Kate . STO
* He had not even thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly , almost _RARE_ , encounter her . STO
* At these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest , but it was an objective pain , in no way different from others in intensity and not different in kind ; ; it was like the _RARE_ wound on the back of his head which occasionally _RARE_ ; ; it was merely another part of his weakness . STO
* He was calm , _RARE_ , and lazy . STO
* He did not care . STO
* Rachel mentioned Kate . STO
* She said , `` I notice the girl from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit '' . STO
* Scotty said , `` That's all right . STO
* _RARE_ all right '' . STO
* He thought about it briefly , then deliberately turned the talk to something else . STO
* Once , sitting at the front window in his _RARE_ room , he saw Kate come out of her house . STO
* She was with Elizabeth . STO
* They were far off and looked tiny . STO
* The heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them . STO
* They turned at the bottom of _RARE_ steps and moved off in the direction of the park . STO
* He thought he saw -- it _RARE_ and , for a moment , interested him -- that Elizabeth held a _RARE_ in her hand and that a round _RARE_ _RARE_ was on the end of the _RARE_ . STO
* Then they disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed . STO
* By the time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate . STO
* The doctor , since Scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him , came often and _RARE_ to the house . STO
* He would sit , _RARE_ and spare , on the edge of Scotty's bed , his legs crossed so _RARE_ that the crossed foot could tap the floor . STO
* Scotty did not mind the doctor's _RARE_ _RARE_ as he used to . STO
* `` _RARE_ young man '' , he said with mock distaste . STO
* `` I imagine you're always _RARE_ in school '' . STO
* `` I don't go to school any more '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* The doctor had to bend close to hear ; ; his delicate hand , as _RARE_ as a _RARE_ wing , rested absently on Scotty's chest . STO
* Scotty said the same words more loudly . STO
* `` Oh . STO
* Well , we're taking a little vacation , that's all '' . STO
* He turned _RARE_ to Rachel . STO
* `` I think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little . STO
* He could now but the weakness is very definite ; ; it would _RARE_ him further and _RARE_ . STO
* He'll be stronger soon '' . STO
* His _RARE_ was on the table by Scotty's bed and he picked it up and _RARE_ it at Scotty . STO
* He said _RARE_ , `` Just keep the cap on those strong emotions '' . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ silver in the _RARE_ room . STO
* `` I'll drop by again in a few days '' . STO
* Rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone . STO
* She smoothed the covers on Scotty's bed and picked things up from the floor . STO
* She did not touch him . STO
* Scotty watched with _RARE_ . STO
* He did not speak . STO
* He had no desire to . STO
* She said , `` Do you think you'll miss school '' ? STO
* He had noticed how formal and _RARE_ exact Rachel had grown . STO
* He did not care . STO
* He felt her _RARE_ did not concern him , yet he knew he would not care even if it did . STO
* He shook his head . STO
* `` We've had any number of calls about you . STO
* You could win a _RARE_ contest at that school without any trouble . STO
* Miss _RARE_ called twice . STO
* She wants to pay you a visit . STO
* She says the children miss you . STO
* Apparently you were the light of their lives '' . STO
* Scotty shrugged slightly . STO
* Rachel came close to the bed , bent as if she would kiss him , then moved away . STO
* She was frowning . STO
* `` That doctor _RARE_ me '' . STO
* She seemed to speak to herself . STO
* `` Do you suppose his _RARE_ is characteristic of the new Negro professionals or merely of doctors in general '' ? STO
* She turned to him again . STO
* `` Well , Mrs. Charles -- Sally -- has phoned too . STO
* She was very worried '' . STO
* _RARE_ tone was dry . STO
* `` She didn't really say '' -- She glanced away at the floor , then _RARE_ gracefully and picked up one of Scotty's slippers . STO
* `` I mean , do you feel like seeing Kate '' ? STO
* Scotty said , `` I don't know '' . STO
* It was true . STO
* He did not . STO
* There was the slight pain , but it was no different from the _RARE_ in his head . STO
* `` Well , there's time , in any case . STO
* We'll wait till you're stronger and then talk about it '' . STO
* She put the _RARE_ neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed . STO
* Scotty said , `` Okay '' . STO
* This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead . STO
* Scotty was pleased . STO
* His father was a constant _RARE_ . STO
* Scotty would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep slow voice ; ; it floated up the stairs . STO
* `` How's Scotty '' ? STO
* And _RARE_ or _RARE_ reply : `` better . STO
* He's getting plenty of rest '' . STO
* `` Is his appetite improved '' ? STO
* Or : `` Does he get exercise '' ? STO
* The exchange was almost _RARE_ , and Scotty , in his bed , could hear every word of it . STO
* He never smiled . STO
* It required an energy he no longer possessed to be _RARE_ about his father . STO
* His father would come upstairs and stand _RARE_ at the foot of the bed and look at his son . STO
* After a pause , during which he studied Scotty's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too , Mr. McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs . STO
* Scotty would reply softly and his father , _RARE_ , would ask him to repeat . STO
* `` I'm eating more '' , he would say . STO
* Or : `` I walk around the house a lot '' . STO
* `` Perhaps you should get out a little '' . STO
* `` I'm not supposed to yet '' . STO
* He was not _RARE_ . STO
* He did not mind the useless , _RARE_ questions . STO
* He looked at the lined face with vague interest ; ; he felt he was _RARE_ it , as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger . STO
* Mr. McKinley examined everything with critical care , seeking something material to blame for his son's illness . STO
* `` Have you got enough blankets '' ? STO
* And another time , without _RARE_ : `` You never wore that _RARE_ I bought you '' . STO
* Where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves upward in angry motion , Papa-san sat _RARE_ , his smooth _RARE_ , his very _RARE_ _RARE_ all the turmoil about him . STO
* `` Our objective '' , the colonel had said that day of the _RARE_ , `` is Papa-san '' . STO
* There the objective sat , brooding over all . STO
* _RARE_ , burn , blast , _RARE_ it as they would , could anyone really take Papa-san ? STO
* Between the _RARE_ _RARE_ and himself , in the valley over which Papa-san _RARE_ , men had hidden high _RARE_ , _RARE_ traps , and mines . STO
* The _RARE_ valley was a pregnant _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* On the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire . STO
* At the _RARE_ base _RARE_ of _RARE_ stretched out of eye range like a wild _RARE_ of children's _RARE_ , stopped simultaneously , _RARE_ poised as if _RARE_ the magic of the child's touch to start them all rolling again . STO
* _RARE_ still , regular _RARE_ of barbed wire hung on timber supports . STO
* Was it all _RARE_ labor ? STO
* Who would clean up the mess when the war was over ? STO
* _RARE_ at his _RARE_ thoughts , Warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down . STO
* _RARE_ a group of men , tomorrow night he himself , would go out there somewhere and wait . STO
* If he were to go with White , he would be out there two days , not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san , but moving ever deeper into enemy land -- behind Papa-san -- itself . STO
* Was this what he had expected ? STO
* He hadn't realized that there would be so much time to think , so many _RARE_ . STO
* Somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told , that combat was an _RARE_ activity . STO
* Now he knew that the moment illuminated by the vision on the train would have to be approached . STO
* It could take place tomorrow night , or it might occur months from now . STO
* There was just too much time . STO
* Time to become afraid . STO
* _RARE_ suggestion _RARE_ , but he did not like the identity . STO
* He did not _RARE_ over with hatred for the enemy . STO
* He hadn't even seen him yet _RARE_ his cigarette out in the earth , Warren walked to the slit and scanned the _RARE_ hills . STO
* He saw no life , but still stood there for a time peering at the _RARE_ hills , his gaze continually returning to Papa-san . STO
* He had come here in order to test himself . STO
* While most of his beliefs were still _RARE_ , he knew that he did not believe in killing . STO
* Yet , he was here . STO
* He had come because he could not live out his life feeling that he had been a _RARE_ . STO
* There were ten men on the patrol which Sergeant Prevot led out that next night . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ was carrying a _RARE_ machine gun ; ; another man _RARE_ the _RARE_ and a box of ammunition . STO
* Warren and White each carried , in addition to their own weapons and _RARE_ , a box of _RARE_ for the _RARE_ machine gun . STO
* Others carried extra _RARE_ for the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , which was in the hands of a little Mexican named _RARE_ . STO
* Prevot had _RARE_ the two new men that afternoon . STO
* `` We just sit quiet and wait '' , Prevot had said . STO
* `` Be sure the man nearest you is awake . STO
* If Joe doesn't show up , we'll all be back here at _RARE_ hours . STO
* Otherwise , we hold a reception . STO
* Then we pull out under our mortar and _RARE_ cover , but nobody pulls out until I say so . STO
* Remember what I said about going out to get anybody left behind ? STO
* That still holds . STO
* We bring back all dead and wounded '' . STO
* At _RARE_ hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the point of departure . STO
* Then began the journey through their own mine fields . STO
* Mines . STO
* _RARE_ were _RARE_ than theirs , some said . STO
* They set bouncing _RARE_ to jump and _RARE_ at _RARE_ level while we more _RARE_ had them go off at the head . STO
* Mines . STO
* Big ones and little . STO
* The crude wooden boxes of the enemy , our nicely turned gray metal _RARE_ . STO
* But theirs _RARE_ the _RARE_ . STO
* Mines . STO
* A foot misplaced , a leg missing . STO
* Mines . STO
* All sizes : big ones , some wired to set off a whole field , little ones , hand _RARE_ size . STO
* _RARE_ traps to fill the head with _RARE_ of metal . STO
* Warren tried to shake off the _RARE_ of his fears by looking at the sky . STO
* It was dark . STO
* Prevot had said that the _RARE_ would be bounced off the clouds at _RARE_ hours , `` which gives us time to get settled in position '' . STO
* Because they were new men and to be sure that they didn't get lost , Prevot had placed Warren and White in the center of the patrol as it filed out . STO
* His eyes now fixed on _RARE_ solid figure , Warren could hear behind him the _RARE_ of another . STO
* He could also hear the stream which he had seen from his position . STO
* They were going to follow it for part of their journey . STO
* `` It's safe '' , Prevot had said , `` and it provides cover for our noise '' . STO
* Soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night . STO
* On their right rose the _RARE_ covered with brush and trees . STO
* If a branch extended out too far , each man held it back for the next , and if they met a low _RARE_ , each warned the other . STO
* Thus , _RARE_ they advanced _RARE_ ; ; then they turned to the right , climbed the _RARE_ , and walked into the valley again . STO
* There was no cover here , only grass _RARE_ against _RARE_ . STO
* And with each sigh , like a whip in the hand of an expert , the grass stripped something from Warren . STO
* The gentle _RARE_ of each _RARE_ left him more naked than before , until he felt his _RARE_ flesh tremble , _RARE_ by each new sound . STO
* The shapes of the men ahead of him lacked _RARE_ , as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh . STO
* The dark forms moved like _RARE_ on some _RARE_ _RARE_ , their _RARE_ _RARE_ for want of vocal _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ , broken trees in the valley assumed _RARE_ shapes . STO
* _RARE_ of brush that they passed were so many _RARE_ _RARE_ straining in anger to tear and _RARE_ on his bones . STO
* _RARE_ over all , Papa-san _RARE_ down at him , threatening a hundred hidden _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ in the distance a _RARE_ flashed on , its beam _RARE_ the sky . STO
* The sharp _RARE_ was absorbed by a cloud , then reflected to the earth in a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Somewhere over there another patrol had need of light . STO
* Warren thought of all the men out that night who , like himself , had left their _RARE_ ridge and -- fear working at their guts -- picked their way into the area beyond . STO
* From the east to the west coast of the _RARE_ _RARE_ was a strip of land in which _RARE_ men were at that same moment _RARE_ crawling through the night , sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound , or shouting _RARE_ confused rifle _RARE_ and muzzle _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ arm went up and Warren raised his own . STO
* The patrol was stopping . STO
* Prevot came up `` . STO
* Take that spot over there '' , he whispered , pointing to a small _RARE_ of blackness . STO
* `` Give me your machine gun _RARE_ '' . STO
* Warren handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line . STO
* _RARE_ in the grass behind the brush _RARE_ , Warren looked about . STO
* The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush . STO
* Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew . STO
* Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes , setting up the machine gun on a small _RARE_ so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol . STO
* Warren _RARE_ his _RARE_ safety off and gently , slowly sneaked another _RARE_ of ammunition from one of the cloth _RARE_ that marked the upper part of his body with an Aj . STO
* This he placed within quick reach . STO
* The walk and his fears had served to _RARE_ him and his sweaty _RARE_ cooled at the touch of the night air . STO
* Although the _RARE_ _RARE_ fitted the upper part of his body _RARE_ , he felt no security . STO
* Figures seemed to _RARE_ in the surrounding dark ; ; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched . STO
* Certain this _RARE_ was only imaginary , he yet stared in _RARE_ horror , his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon . STO
* He was aware of insistent inner _RARE_ , as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body . STO
* Above , the _RARE_ ivory _RARE_ of their _RARE_ pointed at the clouds , _RARE_ the _RARE_ dark to a _RARE_ light . STO
* Then the figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees , standing like the _RARE_ of a medieval _RARE_ scene . STO
* Even so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; ; the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ presence of the other men in the patrol , he felt _RARE_ united to these nine _RARE_ sharing this _RARE_ of being with him . STO
* He sensed something precious in the _RARE_ moment , something _RARE_ to the knowledge gained on his _RARE_ trip through the French _RARE_ , a knowledge _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* -- In France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone _RARE_ men had thrown up to the sky , and always as he wandered , he felt a stranger to their _RARE_ . STO
* They were poems in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning -- enough to make his being _RARE_ with the desire for the _RARE_ he sensed there . STO
* _RARE_ , that _RARE_ mystery through which he traveled for thirty days , sleeping in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ or alongside roads , had worked some subtle change in him , he knew , and it was in _RARE_ that he had met Pierre . STO
* Pierre had no hands ; ; they had been severed at the wrists . STO
* With leather cups fitted in his _RARE_ , he _RARE_ his _RARE_ . STO
* He and Warren had traveled together for four days . STO
* They visited the _RARE_ at _RARE_ and Pierre had to sign the register , _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of the visiting _RARE_ . STO
* He took the pen in his _RARE_ and began to write . STO
* `` Wait ! STO
* Wait '' ! STO
* _RARE_ the guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside . STO
* They crowded the small room and peered over one _RARE_ shoulders to watch the _RARE_ man write his name in the book . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , they exclaimed . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* And then the questions came , eager , interested questions , and many _RARE_ on his having overcome his _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ it ever bother you '' , Warren had asked , `` to have people always asking you about your hands '' ? STO
* `` Oh , the French are a very curious people '' , Pierre had laughed . STO
* `` They are also honest _RARE_ after truth . STO
* Now the English are painfully silent about my missing hands . STO
* They refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there . STO
* The Americans , like yourself , take the fact for granted , try to be helpful , but don't ask questions . STO
* I'm used to all three , but I think the French have the _RARE_ attitude '' . STO
* That was the day that Pierre had told Warren about the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* `` You are looking tired and there you can rest . STO
* It will be good for you . STO
* I think , too '' , he said , his dark eyes _RARE_ , `` that you will find there some clue to the secret of the _RARE_ about which you have spoken '' . STO
* Within two weeks Warren was ringing the bell at the _RARE_ gate . STO
* The monk who opened the door immediately calmed his worries about his reception : `` I speak English '' , the old man said , `` but I do not hear it very well '' . STO
* He smiled and stuck a large finger with white hairs _RARE_ on it into his ear as though that might help . STO
* _RARE_ at _RARE_ _RARE_ , the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor . STO
* `` Will you please wait in here . STO
* _RARE_ sat over his second _RARE_ in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue . STO
* _RARE_ Little _RARE_ was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the _RARE_ scent of beer , _RARE_ smoke , and Italian cooking . STO
* _RARE_ over the bar was an oil painting of a nude _RARE_ had accepted from a student at the _RARE_ _RARE_ who needed to eat and drink and was broke . STO
* The nude was small and _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and was called `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* This was one place where _RARE_ could go for a drink in a back _RARE_ without anyone _RARE_ him , or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the _RARE_ . STO
* The other _RARE_ were taxi drivers and art students and small _RARE_ . STO
* The reporters had not yet discovered that this was his _RARE_ . STO
* His friend Jane was with him . STO
* She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did _RARE_ too much and didn't own the _RARE_ . STO
* She was the widow of a writer who had died in an _RARE_ crash , and _RARE_ had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury . STO
* This meant _RARE_ out press _RARE_ and the like . STO
* Jane sat _RARE_ and interested . STO
* _RARE_ had a pleasant glow as he said , `` You see , both of them , I mean the President and _RARE_ Lawrence , are _RARE_ . STO
* A romantic is one who thinks the world is _RARE_ _RARE_ and all he has to do is find the right key , and then _RARE_ justice and _RARE_ will appear . STO
* It's like focusing a camera ; ; the distant ship isn't there until you get the focus . STO
* You know what I'm talking about . STO
* I'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live with them . STO
* `` But when it comes to war , the Colonel knows what it is and _RARE_ doesn't . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ knows that a soldier will get the _RARE_ Service _RARE_ for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian . STO
* He had a mean , _RARE_ sheer bastard in his outfit , and someone _RARE_ the name Trig for him . STO
* That's to say , he was trigger happy . STO
* He'd shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own _RARE_ . STO
* He was a wiry , _RARE_ , silent country boy from the red clay of rural Alabama , and he spoke with the broad _RARE_ that others normally make fun of . STO
* But not in front of Trig . STO
* I heard of some that tried it back in the States , and he'd knock them clear across the room . STO
* _RARE_ been a pretty bad incident back at the Marine base . STO
* A New York kid , a refugee from one of the Harlem _RARE_ , made fun of _RARE_ _RARE_ , and drew a knife . STO
* Before the fight was over , the Harlem boy had a _RARE_ and Trig was cut up badly . STO
* They caught Trig stealing liquor from the _RARE_ mess , and he got a couple of girls in trouble . STO
* The fear of punishment just didn't bother him . STO
* It wasn't there . STO
* It was left out of him at birth . STO
* This is why he made such a magnificent soldier . STO
* He wasn't troubled with the ordinary , _RARE_ fear that _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ individual soldiers and whole companies under fire running in panic . STO
* It just didn't occur to Trig that anything serious would happen to him . STO
* Do you get the picture of the kind of fellow he was '' ? STO
* Jane nodded with a pleasant smile . STO
* `` All right . STO
* There was a _RARE_ nest in a mountain cave , and it was picking off our men with _RARE_ accuracy . STO
* The Colonel ordered that it be wiped out , and I suggested , ' You ask for volunteers , and promise each man on the patrol a _RARE_ of whisky , ten dollars and a _RARE_ pass to _RARE_ . STO
* Trig was one of the five volunteers . STO
* The patrol _RARE_ around in back of the cave , approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild _RARE_ . STO
* You could hear them from our _RARE_ . STO
* There was a lot of shooting . STO
* We knew the enemy was subdued , because a _RARE_ was fired as the signal . STO
* So we hurried over . STO
* Two of our men were killed , a third was wounded . STO
* Trig and a very black colored boy from _RARE_ had killed or put out of action ten guerrillas by _RARE_ and _RARE_ fighting . STO
* When we got there , Trig and the Negro were _RARE_ over possession of a gold _RARE_ around the neck of a wounded _RARE_ . STO
* The colored boy had it , and Trig _RARE_ at him with a knife and said , ' Give that to me , you black bastard . STO
* We don't _RARE_ _RARE_ to walk on the same sidewalk with white men where I come from . STO
* `` The Negro got a bad _RARE_ on his chest from the knife wound '' . STO
* `` What did the Colonel do about the men '' ? STO
* Jane asked in her _RARE_ , interested way . STO
* _RARE_ laughed . STO
* `` He recommended both of them for the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ fellow for the _RARE_ _RARE_ , too , for a _RARE_ wound . STO
* So you see Mr. _RARE_ knows what it's all about . STO
* But not _RARE_ Lawrence . STO
* When he was in the war , he was in Law or _RARE_ or something like that , and an old buddy of his told me he would come down on _RARE_ to the _RARE_ and read the _RARE_ for _RARE_ -- just like the one we sent in for Trig -- and go away with a real glow . STO
* These were _RARE_ nine feet tall to him '' . STO
* _RARE_ Lawrence was alone at the small , perfectly appointed table by the window looking out over the river . STO
* He had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a _RARE_ with two heads . STO
* _RARE_ him was Mrs. _RARE_ . STO
* He thought how this _RARE_ , _RARE_ older woman _RARE_ her way through the streets of _RARE_ on a day in June , enjoying the flowers in the shops , the _RARE_ from old friends , but never really drawing a deep , _RARE_ breath , was so like himself . STO
* He , and Mrs. _RARE_ , too , had never permitted themselves the _RARE_ of _RARE_ that dug into the bone marrow of the spirit . STO
* He had not because he was both poor and ambitious . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ a kind of _RARE_ on the ambitious . STO
* They cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars along a dark country _RARE_ . STO
* No , they must look the other way and climb one more painful step up the ladder . STO
* He made the decision with his eyes open , or so he thought . STO
* At any cost , he must leave the _RARE_ Pennsylvania mining town where his father was a _RARE_ . STO
* And so he had , so he had . STO
* At State College , he had no time to walk among the _RARE_ on the _RARE_ edge . STO
* From his room he could look out in _RARE_ and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly , _RARE_ , across the campus , and he could smell the sweet _RARE_ winds . STO
* He was not stone . STO
* He was not _RARE_ . STO
* He had to teach himself patiently that these traps were not for him . STO
* He must mentally pull the _RARE_ and close the window , so that all that existed was in the books before him . STO
* At law school , the same . STO
* More of this _RARE_ down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New York . STO
* By the time he was _RARE_ enough -- his goals were high -- he was _RARE_ and afraid of women . STO
* The only one who would have him was his _RARE_ , the strange unhappy woman who became his wife . STO
* Perhaps it was right ; ; perhaps it was just . STO
* He had dared to _RARE_ nature , to turn his back to the _RARE_ , and he was punished . STO
* Like Mrs. _RARE_ , with her _RARE_ about Peter _RARE_ , he had his moments of _RARE_ over a youth too well spent . STO
* If he had had a son , he would tell him , `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ while _RARE_ may This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying '' . STO
* But then his son could afford it . STO
* Lawrence was waiting for Bill _RARE_ . STO
* The Vice President had called and asked if he could see the Secretary at his home . STO
* He said the matter was urgent . STO
* The Secretary was uneasy about the visit . STO
* He did not like _RARE_ . STO
* He suspected something _RARE_ and _RARE_ about him . STO
* Lawrence could not put his finger on it precisely , and this worried him . STO
* When you disliked or _RARE_ a man , you should have a reason . STO
* _RARE_ nature was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell . STO
* Lawrence stared a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic , hoping that a clue to his dislike of the Vice President would appear . STO
* It did not . STO
* Therefore , he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and _RARE_ with his point of view . STO
* A half hour later the Vice President arrived . STO
* He looked very carefully at every piece of _RARE_ , as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind . STO
* He observed the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the hall , the _RARE_ painting in the library , as well as the long shelves of _RARE_ volumes ; ; the pattern of the _RARE_ rug , the delicate _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He said to the Secretary , `` I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near _RARE_ . STO
* How did you find out about this '' ? STO
* He waved his arm around at the _RARE_ . STO
* It was not a _RARE_ question , Lawrence decided . STO
* This young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious ; ; he had to find out . STO
* The Secretary did not tell him at what cost , at what _RARE_ , he learned these things . STO
* He merely said , `` Any good _RARE_ these days can make you a _RARE_ home '' . STO
* The Vice President said , `` If you hear of any names that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they _RARE_ the Vice _RARE_ home , let me know . STO
* I can do business with that kind '' . STO
* Again , Lawrence thought a little sadly , these were the fees of poverty and ambition . STO
* _RARE_ did not have the chance to grow up _RARE_ . STO
* He had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years . STO
* They had brandy in the library . STO
* _RARE_ looked at Lawrence with a searching glance , the kind that a _RARE_ attorney would give a man on trial . STO
* What are your _RARE_ ? STO
* Where will you break ? STO
* How best to destroy your peace ? STO
* The Vice President said with a slight _RARE_ , `` There isn't anyone who loves the President more than I do . STO
* Old Chris is my ideal . STO
* At the same time , you have to face facts and realize that a man who's been in the Marine Corps all his life doesn't understand much about politics . STO
* What does a monk know about sex '' ? STO
* Lawrence listened with the _RARE_ , _RARE_ calm of the lawyer , but his face was in the shadow . STO
* `` So , we have to protect the old man for his own good . STO
* You see what I mean . STO
* Congress is full of _RARE_ , and if you want to get along with them , you have to be _RARE_ . STO
* This is why I say we just can't go ahead and _RARE_ the Germans and pull down our own defenses . STO
* Let me tell you what happened to me today . STO
* A fellow came up to me , a Senator , I don't have to tell you his name , and he told me , ' I love the President like a brother , but God damn it , he's _RARE_ me . STO
* I've got a quarter of a million Germans in my state , and those _RARE_ tune in on Father _RARE_ every night , and if he tells them to go out and _RARE_ in the public square , that's what they do . STO
* He's telling them now to write letters to their _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ of Germany . STO
* And another one comes to me and he says , ' Look here , there's a mill in my state _RARE_ five thousand people making uniforms for the Navy . STO
* The Bishop looked at him coldly and said , `` Take it or leave it '' ! STO
* _RARE_ , there was nothing else to do . STO
* He was caught in a machine . STO
* But _RARE_ was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let's go and see what it's like '' . STO
* _RARE_ was about _RARE_ miles west of _RARE_ , near the _RARE_ _RARE_ and on the _RARE_ River , a small and dirty stream . STO
* The city was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its _RARE_ , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama . STO
* But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived -- servants and _RARE_ huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and _RARE_ were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime . STO
* Wilson came by train from _RARE_ and looked the city over ; ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were . STO
* Beyond were industries and factories . STO
* Then they went down to Black Bottom . STO
* In the midst of this crowded region was the _RARE_ African Methodist _RARE_ Church . STO
* It was an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair . STO
* But it was a _RARE_ . STO
* It had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town , black and white , knew of it . STO
* It had just suffered a _RARE_ , the final crisis in a long series of _RARE_ . STO
* For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead , and the city _RARE_ him . STO
* He was a _RARE_ man , once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability . STO
* He was stern and _RARE_ with his _RARE_ , but _RARE_ and _RARE_ with the whites , especially the rich who partly supported the church . STO
* The _RARE_ Board , headed by a black man named _RARE_ , had practically taken over as the pastor grew old , and had its way with the support of the Amen corner . STO
* The characteristic thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious _RARE_ . STO
* A knot of old _RARE_ , chiefly women , listened weekly to a _RARE_ . STO
* It began invariably in low tones , almost _RARE_ , and then gradually worked up to high , shrill _RARE_ to God and man . STO
* And then the Amen corner took hold , _RARE_ a form of group participation in worship that _RARE_ from years before the Greek chorus , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West _RARE_ , and then here in Alabama . STO
* With shout and slow dance , with tears and song , with scream and _RARE_ , the corner group was _RARE_ by _RARE_ and shivering , _RARE_ , shouting , possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force . STO
* It spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who _RARE_ behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion . STO
* It sometimes ended in _RARE_ _RARE_ with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor . STO
* To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they lived from week to week . STO
* It was often _RARE_ in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting . STO
* Wilson , on his first Sunday , witnessed this with something like _RARE_ . STO
* He had _RARE_ a short _RARE_ , trying to talk _RARE_ to the audience , to tell them who he was , what he had done in _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and what he proposed to do here . STO
* He _RARE_ with them on the loss of their old pastor . STO
* But then , at mention of that name , the Amen corner broke loose . STO
* He had no chance to say another word . STO
* At the very end , when the audience was silent and _RARE_ , a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed out . STO
* The audience did not think much of the new pastor , and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say . STO
* During the next weeks he looked over the situation . STO
* First of all there was the _RARE_ , an utterly impossible place for _RARE_ people to live in , originally poorly conceived , apparently not repaired for years , with no _RARE_ or sewage , with _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church , a woman named _RARE_ who , as Wilson afterward found , was briefly referred to as The _RARE_ because of her sharp tongue and _RARE_ initiative . STO
* Ann _RARE_ was a lonely , devoted soul , never married , _RARE_ a _RARE_ home and devoted to her church , but a _RARE_ _RARE_ and born _RARE_ . STO
* She _RARE_ over the new pastor like an _RARE_ angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief _RARE_ . STO
* Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition . STO
* The salary of the pastor had for years been _RARE_ annually and even this was in _RARE_ . STO
* Wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least _RARE_ , but when he mentioned this to the _RARE_ they said nothing . STO
* The church itself must be repaired . STO
* It was dirty and neglected . STO
* It really ought to be _RARE_ , and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this . STO
* Meanwhile , the city itself should be talked to . STO
* The streets in the colored section were dirty . STO
* There was _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The children had nowhere to go and no place to play , not even _RARE_ . STO
* The school was small , dark and _RARE_ . STO
* The teacher was a _RARE_ fool . STO
* There were two liquor _RARE_ not very far from the church , one white , that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for Negroes ; ; the other exclusively Negro . STO
* _RARE_ , there was a good deal of gambling in both . STO
* On the other side of the church was a quiet , _RARE_ house with _RARE_ and recently painted . STO
* Wilson inquired about it . STO
* It was called Kent House . STO
* The _RARE_ of the church , _RARE_ , was its _RARE_ . STO
* One of the leading members of the Amen corner was cook ; ; there were two or three colored _RARE_ employed there . STO
* Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people , which seemed to him rather _RARE_ . STO
* Why should a white hotel be set down in the center of Black Bottom ? STO
* But nevertheless it looked respectable . STO
* He was glad to have it there . STO
* The rest of Black Bottom was a rabbit _RARE_ of homes in every condition of neglect , _RARE_ and careful _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , carefully repaired huts , and nicely painted and _RARE_ _RARE_ were _RARE_ together cheek by _RARE_ with little distinction . STO
* The best could not escape from the worst and the worst _RARE_ _RARE_ beside the better . STO
* The yards , front and back , were narrow ; ; some were _RARE_ _RARE_ , some had flower _RARE_ . STO
* Behind were _RARE_ , for there was no sewage system . STO
* After looking about a bit , Wilson discovered beyond Black Bottom , across the river and far removed from the white city , a considerable tract of land , and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot . STO
* He talked about it to the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ looked him over rather carefully . STO
* He was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand . STO
* But there was one thing that he had to stress , and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses , the dollar money , had been seriously falling behind in this church , and that must be looked after immediately . STO
* In fact , he _RARE_ clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent here -- to make a larger contribution of dollar money . STO
* Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was , they must have a better church , a more _RARE_ conduct of the church organization , and an effort to get this religious center out of its _RARE_ of wild worship into a modern church organization . STO
* He emphasized to the _RARE_ _RARE_ the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ was sure that that would be impossible . STO
* But he told Wilson to `` go ahead and try '' . STO
* And Wilson tried . STO
* It did seem impossible . STO
* The bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in _RARE_ , and the real estate people said _RARE_ that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in , and that none would be sold to colored folk . STO
* When it was proposed to _RARE_ the church , Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high . STO
* He was sure that he could do better if he went to _RARE_ to get the deal financed . STO
* But when this proposal was made to his _RARE_ Board , he met _RARE_ opposition . STO
* The church certainly would not be removed . STO
* The very proposition was _RARE_ . STO
* It had been here fifty years . STO
* It was going to stay forever . STO
* It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject . STO
* As for _RARE_ , well , that might be looked into , but there was no hurry , no hurry at all . STO
* Wilson again went downtown to a different _RARE_ , an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic , but he shook his head . STO
* `` Reverend '' , he said , `` I think you don't quite understand the situation here . STO
* Don't you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church ? STO
* _RARE_ , stores , _RARE_ , some gambling , I hope not too much . STO
* The colored people are getting employment at Kent House and other places , and they are near their places of employment . STO
* When a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them . STO
* Now , if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years . STO
* By that time , perhaps something better can be done '' . STO
* Then Wilson asked , `` What about this Kent House which you mention ? STO
* I don't understand why a white hotel should be down here '' . STO
* The young _RARE_ looked at him with a certain surprise , and then he said _RARE_ : `` I'm afraid I can't tell you anything in particular about Kent House . STO
* You'll have to find out about it on your own . STO
* Hope to see you again '' . STO
* And he dismissed the colored pastor . STO
* It was next day that _RARE_ came and sat beside him and took his hand . STO
* She said , `` My dear , do you know what Kent House is '' ? STO
* `` No '' , said Wilson , `` I don't . STO
* I was just asking about it . STO
* What is it '' ? STO
* `` It's a house of _RARE_ for white men with white girls as _RARE_ . STO
* They hire a good deal of local labor , including two members of our _RARE_ Board . STO
* They buy some supplies from our colored _RARE_ and they are _RARE_ by some of the best white gentlemen in town '' . STO
* Wilson stared at her . STO
* `` My dear , you must be mistaken '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ to Mrs. _RARE_ '' , she said . STO
* And after Wilson had talked to Mrs. _RARE_ and to others , he was absolutely amazed . STO
* This , of course , was the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities -- putting white houses of _RARE_ with colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly . STO
* But it had largely disappeared on account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the part of the Negroes as they became more educated and got better wages . STO
* But this situation of Kent House was more subtle . STO
* The wages involved were larger and more regular . STO
* The _RARE_ were white and from out of town , avoiding local friction . STO
* The backing from the white town was greater and there was little publicity . STO
* Good wages , _RARE_ and _RARE_ of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes . STO
* And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go . STO
* And for him to leave this job now without _RARE_ anything would mean practically the end of his career in the Methodist church , if not in all churches . STO
* Payne dismounted in _RARE_ Place and handed the reins to _RARE_ . STO
* There was a fog , which increased the darkness of the night . STO
* Two gas lamps were no more than a _RARE_ glow . STO
* He might have been anywhere or nowhere . STO
* The _RARE_ was that he was _RARE_ a _RARE_ from Dr. _RARE_ . STO
* Secretary of State Seward was a sick man . STO
* The idea had come from _RARE_ , who had once been a _RARE_ clerk . STO
* The sick were always receiving _RARE_ . STO
* No one would question such an errand . STO
* The bottle was filled up with _RARE_ . STO
* Before Payne _RARE_ the Old _RARE_ , _RARE_ home , where _RARE_ had once been killed . STO
* Now it would have another death . STO
* From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ heavily up the _RARE_ and rang the bell . STO
* Like the bell at _RARE_ , the _RARE_ was _RARE_ too high . STO
* It was still Good Friday , after all . STO
* A nigger boy opened the door . STO
* Payne did not notice him . STO
* He was thinking chiefly of Cap . STO
* If their schedules were to _RARE_ , there was no point in _RARE_ time . STO
* He pushed his way inside . STO
* For a moment the hall confused him . STO
* This was the largest house he had ever been in , almost the largest building , except for a hotel . STO
* He had no idea where _RARE_ room would be . STO
* In the half darkness the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the hall seemed enormous . STO
* Above him somewhere were the _RARE_ . STO
* Seward would be up there . STO
* He explained his errand , but without bothering much to make it _RARE_ , for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army . STO
* He did not really want to kill , but as in the sexual act , there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be _RARE_ , even while you watched yourself giving way to it . STO
* He was no longer worried . STO
* Everything would be all right . STO
* He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped . STO
* Still , the sensation always surprised him . STO
* It was a _RARE_ he felt no part in . STO
* He could only watch with a sort of gentle _RARE_ while his body did these quick , _RARE_ , and efficient things . STO
* He brushed by the _RARE_ boy and _RARE_ heavily up the stairs . STO
* They were _RARE_ , but made for _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , not the great _RARE_ he wore . STO
* The sound of his footsteps was like a muffled _RARE_ . STO
* At the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown . STO
* He stopped and whispered his errand . STO
* Young Frederick Seward held out his hand . STO
* _RARE_ a little , Payne shook his head . STO
* Dr. _RARE_ had told him to deliver his package in person . STO
* Frederick Seward said his father was sleeping , and then went through a _RARE_ at his father's door , to prove the statement . STO
* `` Very well '' , Payne said . STO
* `` I will go '' . STO
* He smiled , but now that he knew where the _RARE_ Seward was , he did not _RARE_ to go . STO
* He pulled out his pistol and fired it . STO
* It made no sound . STO
* It had _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ it , he smashed the butt down on Frederick _RARE_ head , over and over again . STO
* It was the first blow that was always difficult . STO
* After that , violence was _RARE_ easy . STO
* He got caught up into it and became a different person . STO
* Only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would _RARE_ over it for days , whereas at the time it had seemed quite real . STO
* The nigger boy fled down the stairs , screaming , `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* It was not murder at all . STO
* Payne was more _RARE_ than that . STO
* He was merely clearing a way to what he had to do . STO
* He ran for the sick room , found his pistol was broken , and threw it away . STO
* A knife would do . STO
* From childhood he had known all about _RARE_ . STO
* Someone blocked the door from inside . STO
* He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness . STO
* He saw only dimly moving figures , but when he slashed them they yelled and fled . STO
* He went for the bed , jumped on it , and struck where he could , repeatedly . STO
* It was like finally getting into one's own _RARE_ to _RARE_ one's dreams . STO
* Two men pulled him off . STO
* Nobody said anything . STO
* Payne _RARE_ at their arms . STO
* There was a lady there , in a _RARE_ . STO
* He would not have wanted to hurt a lady . STO
* Another man approached , this one fully dressed . STO
* When the knife went into his chest , he went down at once . STO
* `` I'm mad '' , shouted Payne , as he ran out into the hall . STO
* `` I'm mad '' , and only wished he had been . STO
* That would have made things so much easier . STO
* But he was not mad . STO
* He was only dreaming . STO
* He _RARE_ down the stairs and out of the door . STO
* Somewhere in the fog , the nigger boy was still yelling murder . STO
* One always _RARE_ up , even from one's own dreams . STO
* The _RARE_ air _RARE_ him . STO
* _RARE_ , he saw , had fled . STO
* Well , one did not expect much of people like _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ his horse , walked it away , mounted , and _RARE_ it on . STO
* The nigger boy was close behind him . STO
* Then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone . STO
* He rode on and on . STO
* He had no idea where he was . STO
* After some time he came to an open field . STO
* An open field was better than a building , that was for sure , so he dismounted , turned off the horse , and plunged through the grass . STO
* He felt curiously sleepy , the world seemed far away ; ; he knew he should get to Cap , but he didn't know how . STO
* He was sure , for he had done as he was told , hadn't he ? STO
* Cap would find him and take care of him . STO
* So choosing a good tree , he clambered up into it , found a comfortable _RARE_ , and curled up in it to sleep , like the _RARE_ bear he was , with his hands across his chest , as though _RARE_ with honey . STO
* _RARE_ always made him tired , but he was not frightened . STO
* In Boston , _RARE_ _RARE_ was winding up a performance of A New _RARE_ To _RARE_ Old _RARE_ . STO
* It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more . STO
* Acting _RARE_ him . STO
* On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . STO
* As Sir _RARE_ _RARE_ ( how often had he had to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he raised his arm and _RARE_ : `` Where is my _RARE_ now '' ? STO
* That was one of the high spots of the play . STO
* The audience , as usual , loved it . STO
* He was delighted to see them so happy . STO
* If he had any worries , it was only the small ones , about Mother in New York , and his daughter _RARE_ and what she might be doing at this hour , with her Aunt Asia , in Philadelphia . STO
* Everyone is _RARE_ about his profession , if he has _RARE_ it long enough , but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those _RARE_ people out there , who might _RARE_ you or _RARE_ you , but that was largely , though not entirely , up to you . STO
* They made the world seem friendly somehow , though he knew it was not . STO
* 7 , _RARE_ was quite right about one thing . STO
* Laura _RARE_ had been in the green room . STO
* The commotion had brought her into the wings . STO
* Since she could not act , one part suited her as well as any other , and so she was the first person to offer Mr. Lincoln a glass of water , holding it up to the box , high above her head , to Miss Harris , who had asked for it . STO
* She had been one of the first to collect her _RARE_ . STO
* It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience , as that they had been stunned already . STO
* Most of them had seen Our American Cousin before , and unless Miss _RARE_ was on stage , there was not much to it . STO
* The theatre was hot and they were _RARE_ with boredom . STO
* The stage had been empty , except for Harry Hawk , doing his star _RARE_ . STO
* The audience was fond of Harry Hawk , he was a dear , in or out of character , but he was not particularly funny . STO
* At the end of the _RARE_ the audience would _RARE_ . STO
* Meanwhile it looked at the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Well , I guess I know enough to turn you inside out , you _RARE_ old _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Said _RARE_ , otherwise Hawk . STO
* There was always a pause here , before the next line . STO
* That was when the gun went off . STO
* Yet even that explosion did not mean much . STO
* _RARE_ were going off all over Washington City these days , because of the _RARE_ , and the theatre was not _RARE_ . STO
* Then the audience saw a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , it said _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ had delivered his line . STO
* Behind him _RARE_ a small _RARE_ cloud of smoke . STO
* They strained forward . STO
* They had not heard what had been said . STO
* They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily . STO
* The figure _RARE_ from the box , almost lost its balance , the flag draped there tore in the air , the figure landed on its left leg , fell on its hands , and pressed itself up . STO
* Harry Hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings . STO
* His speech _RARE_ . STO
* He did not lower his arm . STO
* The figure was so _RARE_ dressed , that it was as though a character from some other play had _RARE_ into this one . STO
* The play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The _RARE_ . STO
* This figure looked like the slave _RARE_ from that . STO
* But it also looked like a _RARE_ , _RARE_ away from the light . STO
* There was something _RARE_ and crazy about its motion that disturbed them . STO
* Then it disappeared into the wings . STO
* Harry Hawk had not shifted position , but he at last lowered his arm . STO
* Mrs. Lincoln screamed . STO
* There was no _RARE_ that scream . STO
* It was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do . STO
* Yet this scream had a different note in it . STO
* That absence of an urgent _RARE_ dashed them awake like a _RARE_ of water . STO
* _RARE_ Harris , one of the guests in the box , stood up and demanded water . STO
* Her action was _RARE_ . STO
* When something unexpected happened , one always asked for water if one were a woman , brandy if one were a man . STO
* Mrs. Lincoln screamed again . STO
* In the Presidential box someone leaned over the _RARE_ and yelled : `` He has shot the President '' ! STO
* That got everybody up . STO
* On the stage , Harry Hawk began to weep . STO
* Laura _RARE_ brushed by him with the glass of water . STO
* The crowd began to move . STO
* In Washington City everyone lived in a bubble of _RARE_ , and one death might attract another . STO
* It was not exactly panic they gave way to , but they could not just sit there . STO
* The _RARE_ voices , for no one could bear silence , _RARE_ out the sound of Mrs. _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* At the rear of the _RARE_ , upstairs , some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor . STO
* It would not give . STO
* A Dr. Charles _RARE_ clambered up on the stage and got the actors to _RARE_ him up to the box . STO
* In the audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same principle which had led Miss Harris to demand water . STO
* Someone opened the corridor door from the inside , and called for a doctor . STO
* Somehow Dr. Charles _RARE_ was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the dingy corridor . STO
* He went straight to the Presidential box . STO
* As usual , Mrs. Lincoln had lost her head , but nobody _RARE_ her for doing so now . STO
* There was a little blood on the _RARE_ of her dress , for the assassin had slashed Miss _RARE_ companion , Major _RARE_ , with a knife . STO
* _RARE_ said he was bleeding to death . STO
* By the look of him he wasn't that far gone . STO
* With a _RARE_ , the man spread his legs and , a third time , confronted them . STO
* Once more , Katie reared , and _RARE_ in fear . STO
* For a moment , boy and mount hung in _RARE_ . STO
* Stevie twisted and , frantically , commanded the mare to leap straight ahead . STO
* But the stranger was _RARE_ still . STO
* With a bold arm , he dared once more to _RARE_ them . STO
* Katie reared a third time , then , trembling , descended . STO
* The stranger _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ , he _RARE_ with all his might and forced Katie to her knees . STO
* It was absurd . STO
* Stevie could feel himself _RARE_ . STO
* He saw the ground coming up -- and the _RARE_ head . STO
* With incredible _RARE_ , he brought his fists together and struck . STO
* The blow encountered _RARE_ hair and hard bone . STO
* The man _RARE_ a _RARE_ cry , spun about , and collapsed in the sand . STO
* Katie scrambled to her feet , Stevie _RARE_ _RARE_ his seat . STO
* Again Katie reared , and now , _RARE_ , he compelled her to bring her _RARE_ down again and again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger . STO
* He could feel his own feet , _RARE_ , striking repeatedly until the body was limp . STO
* He _RARE_ , and his lips _RARE_ . STO
* He heard himself _RARE_ . STO
* They rode around and around to _RARE_ the figure into the sand . STO
* Only the top of the head , with a spot bare and white as a _RARE_ , remained visible . STO
* Stevie was shouting triumphantly . STO
* A train _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , he _RARE_ . STO
* They were _RARE_ him . STO
* He was frightened ; ; his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt . STO
* Then Katie stumbled , and again he was falling , falling ! STO
* `` Stevie ! STO
* Stevie '' ! STO
* His mother was _RARE_ him , but he was still falling . STO
* His head hung over the boards of _RARE_ stall ; ; before it was sprawled the _RARE_ corpse of the _RARE_ stranger . STO
* `` Stevie , wake up now ! STO
* We're nearly there '' . STO
* He had been dreaming . STO
* He was safe in his _RARE_ arms . STO
* The train had slowed . STO
* _RARE_ winked as the cars rolled beside a little _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* The _RARE_ called . STO
* He came by and repeated , `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Chapter 6 Bong ! STO
* Bong ! STO
* _RARE_ him awake . STO
* The room _RARE_ as if a giant hand had rocked it . STO
* Bong ! STO
* A dull _RARE_ and a _RARE_ echo . STO
* The walls _RARE_ , the floor trembled , the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He stared at the far morning , expecting a _RARE_ to swing across the horizon . STO
* Bong ! STO
* He raced to the window and yanked at the _RARE_ . STO
* Bong ! STO
* The wood was old , the paint _RARE_ . STO
* Bong ! STO
* A fresh breeze _RARE_ him . STO
* Six o'clock ! STO
* He put his head out . STO
* There was the _RARE_ roof of the church ; ; _RARE_ climbed the red brick walls like a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The clock which had struck presented an innocent face . STO
* In the kitchen Mama was _RARE_ the _RARE_ . STO
* `` There's a tower and a steeple on the church a million feet high . STO
* And the _RARE_ clock in the whole world '' ! STO
* `` I know , Stephen '' , she smiled . STO
* `` They say that our steeple is one hundred and _RARE_ feet high . STO
* The clock you heard strike -- it's really the town clock -- was installed last April by Mrs. _RARE_ , on her birthday '' . STO
* He dressed , and sped _RARE_ . STO
* He crossed _RARE_ Street to _RARE_ Square . STO
* The steeple leaned backward , while the church advanced like a _RARE_ creature in a long , _RARE_ coat . STO
* The _RARE_ seemed to hold up the sky . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , was the city of God . STO
* The Dutch _RARE_ Church , with two _RARE_ and its own school was on Main Street ; ; the _RARE_ Church was one block down _RARE_ Street ; ; the Catholic Saint Mary's Church , with an even taller steeple and a cross on top , stood on _RARE_ Street . STO
* The _RARE_ had the largest cemetery , near the _RARE_ River where Main Street ran south ; ; Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds . STO
* God was everywhere , in the _RARE_ , in the steeple , in the clouds , in the trees , and in the mountains _RARE_ on the horizon . STO
* Somewhere , beyond , where shadows _RARE_ , must be the _RARE_ pit of which Papa _RARE_ and the _RARE_ Lake of Fire . STO
* So , walking in _RARE_ , he became familiar with God , who _RARE_ chiefly in Drew _RARE_ Church with its high steeple and clock . STO
* There was no church like Drew Church , no preacher like Papa , who was intimate with Him , and could _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* To know God he must follow in _RARE_ footsteps . STO
* He was fortunate , and proud . STO
* The _RARE_ , _RARE_ on their _RARE_ in the Square , beneath the _RARE_ monument , got to their feet when Papa approached : `` _RARE_ , Reverend '' ! STO
* His being and His will -- Stevie could not divide God from his Papa -- _RARE_ every _RARE_ face , turned the _RARE_ into a band of angels , and the _RARE_ into the _RARE_ to Heaven . STO
* `` We have nine hundred and eleven members in our charge '' , Mama announced , `` and three hundred and eighty _RARE_ scholars '' . STO
* When Papa went out to do God's work , Stevie often accompanied him in the _RARE_ , which was drawn by Violet , the new black mare . STO
* Although they _RARE_ _RARE_ as far as _RARE_ , beyond the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the machine shop , and along the Delaware and Hudson _RARE_ , and _RARE_ to Brooklyn , below Point Peter , he could see the church _RARE_ wherever he looked back . STO
* Sometimes they went south and rolled past the _RARE_ -- `` _RARE_ , Reverend '' ! STO
* -- and crossed the suspension bridge to _RARE_ ; ; that was Pennsylvania . STO
* In the Delaware River , three long _RARE_ were _RARE_ with _RARE_ trees and _RARE_ . STO
* South of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and below the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ and the Delaware , was the _RARE_ Rock , from which Stevie could _RARE_ New Jersey and Pennsylvania , as well as New York , simply by spinning around on his _RARE_ . STO
* On these _RARE_ , Papa instructed him on man's chief end , which was his duty to God and his own _RARE_ . STO
* However , a boy's _RARE_ eyes might _RARE_ . STO
* Where _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ into the _RARE_ was a magnificent swimming hole . STO
* Papa pointed a _RARE_ finger at the _RARE_ youth : `` _RARE_ recreation '' ! STO
* Stevie saw no _RARE_ ; ; it troubled him that he couldn't always see what Papa saw . STO
* He was torn between the excitement in the _RARE_ waters and a little engine _RARE_ _RARE_ on the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` Where you been today '' ? STO
* Ludie inquired every evening , pretending that he did not care . STO
* `` He'll make a preacher out of you '' ! STO
* `` No , he won't '' ! STO
* Stevie _RARE_ . STO
* `` Not me '' ! STO
* `` _RARE_ got to be a preacher in the family . STO
* He made a will and last _RARE_ before we left _RARE_ . STO
* I heard them ! STO
* Uncle and Aunt _RARE_ were the witnesses '' . STO
* `` Will he die '' ? STO
* `` Everybody does '' . STO
* Ludie could be _RARE_ . STO
* To speak of Papa dying was a sin . STO
* It could never happen as long as God was alert and the Drew steeple stood guard with its peaked _RARE_ . STO
* Stevie was constantly _RARE_ into the church . STO
* He pulled with all his strength at the heavy , _RARE_ door , and _RARE_ along the _RARE_ wall . STO
* The cold , mysterious presence of God was all around him . STO
* At the end of a shaft of light , the _RARE_ appeared to be broad stairs in a long _RARE_ . STO
* Far away , standing before a _RARE_ window in the study room , was his father , hands _RARE_ under his _RARE_ , and staring into the dark church . STO
* The figure was _RARE_ in an extraordinary _RARE_ . STO
* The boy shuddered at the _RARE_ pale countenance with its _RARE_ and gray hair . STO
* Would Papa really die ? STO
* The mouth was _RARE_ and wide , the long _RARE_ in the upper lip like a slide . STO
* When _RARE_ slender fingers removed the _RARE_ , there were red _RARE_ on the bridge of the strong nose . STO
* `` It's time you began to think on God , Stephen . STO
* Perhaps one day He will choose you as He chose me , long ago . STO
* Therefore , give Him your affection and store up His love for you . STO
* _RARE_ your heart to Him and _RARE_ , Stephen , _RARE_ ! STO
* For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the Lake of Fire '' . STO
* Stevie had heard these words many times , yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble . STO
* For he feared the Lake of Fire . STO
* He _RARE_ to think of God and His eternal _RARE_ ; ; he must _RARE_ to be _RARE_ . STO
* Papa was disappointed that none of the brothers had heard the Call . STO
* Not George , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ , certainly not Ludie . STO
* _RARE_ was at _RARE_ and Will at Albany Law School , where they surely could not hear it . STO
* _RARE_ God would choose him . STO
* He would hear the Call and would run to tell Papa . STO
* The stern face would relax , the _RARE_ arms would embrace him , `` My son '' ! STO
* Yet how might he know the Call when it came ? STO
* Probably , as in _RARE_ , a still , small voice would whisper . STO
* It would _RARE_ him once ; ; if he missed it , never again . STO
* What if it came when he was playing , or was asleep and dreaming ? STO
* He must not fail to hear it . STO
* He was _RARE_ chosen ; ; therefore , nothing but good could happen to him , even in God's _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* When the _RARE_ grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley , he was _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ might fly into a closet , shut the door and _RARE_ her head in the clothes ; ; he dared to wait for the lightning . STO
* _RARE_ could strike you blind if you were a _RARE_ ! STO
* But he was good . STO
* He _RARE_ his fists and faced the terror . STO
* _RARE_ crashed ; ; _RARE_ tumbled down the _RARE_ , and bounced and bounced till their own fury split them open . STO
* _RARE_ might strike the _RARE_ of the other churches ; ; not of Drew Church . STO
* A flash _RARE_ the trees as a _RARE_ bolt _RARE_ in several directions . STO
* Violet _RARE_ from the stable . STO
* He ran out into the _RARE_ , sped across the yard and into the _RARE_ room . STO
* `` Don't be afraid , Violet '' ! STO
* He shouted , and was _RARE_ at the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Don't you be afraid '' ! STO
* He would save her . STO
* If there was a fire or a _RARE_ he would save Mama first and Violet next . STO
* _RARE_ and shaking , he stood near the _RARE_ stall and dared to _RARE_ her muzzle . STO
* `` Don't you be afraid , Violet '' ! STO
* After the storm , the sky cleared blue and cool , and _RARE_ air swept the hills . STO
* When the sun came out , Stevie strode proudly into _RARE_ Square , smiling like a landlord on _RARE_ tenants . STO
* The fountain had _RARE_ over , the _RARE_ were wet , the _RARE_ monument _RARE_ . STO
* Even before the _RARE_ had dried , the Civil War _RARE_ were _RARE_ back to their places . STO
* The great _RARE_ _RARE_ as if the lightning had polished it . STO
* He jumped . STO
* The pointed shadow had nearly touched him . STO
* He trailed Ludie to the baseball game in the lot on _RARE_ Street near the Dutch _RARE_ . STO
* `` Go on home '' ! STO
* Ludie screeched at him . STO
* `` _RARE_ tell Papa '' ! STO
* No one told on Ludie , not even when he slipped live _RARE_ into the _RARE_ . STO
* Ludie did as he pleased . STO
* Ludie took his _RARE_ and climbed to the _RARE_ to shoot at _RARE_ . STO
* Ludie _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Ludie had a cigar box full of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and a Roman candle from last Fourth of July . STO
* Ludie _RARE_ rides on freight cars , and was _RARE_ by Mr. _RARE_ , the railroad guard . STO
* He came home _RARE_ , ran straight to the _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ cold water . STO
* Stevie _RARE_ him . STO
* That Ludie ! STO
* He , too , cocked his cap at a _RARE_ angle , _RARE_ _RARE_ in his pocket , and _RARE_ down Main Street . STO
* On the _RARE_ lawn , little girls in white _RARE_ were playing _RARE_ at a tea party . STO
* A _RARE_ sat _RARE_ beside a _RARE_ half his size . STO
* Stevie _RARE_ for a dog . STO
* He wondered whether God had a dog in the sky . STO
* He _RARE_ down _RARE_ Street , past the First National Bank with its green window shades . STO
* He crossed the _RARE_ to Delaware House , where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ crowded the _RARE_ . STO
* A tall lady , with a _RARE_ collar very low on her bosom , turned _RARE_ green eyes upon him . STO
* She was taller than _RARE_ . STO
* She was so beautiful with her _RARE_ mouth and _RARE_ air that she had to be wicked . STO
* _RARE_ screeched ; ; a piano _RARE_ . STO
* `` P. J. '' -- as Ludie called the town -- was crowded with summer people who came to the mountains to escape the heat in the big cities . STO
* They stayed at hotels and _RARE_ , or at private homes . STO
* _RARE_ people went to Delaware House , _RARE_ House , American House or _RARE_ House . STO
* If the _RARE_ bastard could write ! STO
* That's how it should be . STO
* It's those two fucken _RARE_ ! STO
* _RARE_ , I wish they could write ! STO
* _RARE_ pussy . STO
* He thought of sweet wet nigger pussy . STO
* Oh , sweet land of heaven , _RARE_ there just _RARE_ like sweet nigger pussy ! STO
* He thought of her , the first one . STO
* He had caught her coming out of the _RARE_ . STO
* She was a _RARE_ one . STO
* Oh how they bounced ! STO
* _RARE_ , warm , sweet and _RARE_ , sweet _RARE_ sixteen , she was . STO
* Man , how I love nigger pussy ! STO
* The snow came a little faster now , he noted . STO
* He thought of Joe Harris , the nigger who had gone after his sister . STO
* He chuckled , the memory vivid . STO
* _RARE_ , We _RARE_ him ! STO
* _RARE_ , we fixed him ! STO
* The snow again . STO
* If only the fucken weather wasn't so lousy ! STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , Lord . STO
* What I have to put up with ! STO
* _RARE_ , I can't figure out what in hell for they went and put _RARE_ in my squad for . STO
* Only one worth a _RARE_ , and that's Brandon . STO
* He ain't so bad . STO
* His thoughts turned to other things . STO
* The big shock everybody had when they found _RARE_ Slater and those others done for . STO
* _RARE_ for . STO
* He had been pretty scared himself , wondering what the hell was coming off . STO
* But he soon saw which way the ball was bouncing . STO
* Soon came back to his senses . STO
* `` I soon came back to my senses '' , he said , aloud , to the young _RARE_ , proudly , drawing himself up , as if making a report to some important superior . STO
* I was the first to get my squad on the ball , and anybody _RARE_ it was easy is pretty damn dumb . STO
* Look at _RARE_ . STO
* That goddamn _RARE_ was the worst . STO
* He kept _RARE_ , not me , not me , I don't _RARE_ wind up like _RARE_ . STO
* But I told him , _RARE_ . STO
* `` I told him '' , he said aloud They'll get the guys that done it . STO
* That'll put the place back to normal . STO
* _RARE_ , by God . STO
* Maybe it's a good thing it happened . STO
* Maybe they'll stop it now , once for all . STO
* _RARE_ the place up . STO
* They're _RARE_ it now . STO
* I hear the whole bunch is _RARE_ out in the snow . STO
* They'll get the guys that done it . STO
* There was something _RARE_ him though : as yet they hadn't Five days . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ of annoyance ran through him . STO
* His eyes blinked hard , snapping on and _RARE_ some bad things that were trying to push their way into him . STO
* A tune began to _RARE_ inside his head . STO
* One of his _RARE_ : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* It always came on , _RARE_ , just like a radio or _RARE_ box , whenever he started to worry too much about something , when the bad things tried to push their way into him . STO
* The music drove them off , or away , and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments , humming and _RARE_ within , beating the rhythm within . STO
* He glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the _RARE_ when they caught them . STO
* _RARE_ the bastards over to me -- to me and my boys -- no nigger ever got what would be _RARE_ to them -- reactionary bastards . STO
* He had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a _RARE_ began . STO
* It was a word he was proud of , a word that meant much to him , and he used it with great pleasure , almost as if it were an exclusive possession , and more : he sensed himself to be very highly educated , four cuts above any of the folks back home . STO
* `` Four cuts at least '' , he chuckled to himself , `` and I owe it all to them '' . STO
* The word also made him feel hate , sincere hate , for those so labeled . STO
* He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball . STO
* It came up again and again in the discussion sessions . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ bastards been _RARE_ to _RARE_ up the Program for months . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , hard _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Not captured , sent here . STO
* To _RARE_ up the program . STO
* You guys remember that . STO
* Remember that He heard himself _RARE_ them . STO
* He saw himself before them _RARE_ the speech . STO
* He laughed , suddenly , feeling a _RARE_ of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving _RARE_ respect and attention . STO
* One day , _RARE_ had told him ( smiling , _RARE_ him on the back ) as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders , `` Keep it up , your squad is good , one of the best , keep it up , keep up the good work '' . STO
* He would ! STO
* That was really something , coming from _RARE_ . STO
* `` Really something '' , he said , aloud . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ bastards _RARE_ down here in the night and _RARE_ off _RARE_ Slater and those other poor bastards . STO
* `` They'll get them by God and let them bring them down here to me , just let them , God , I'll _RARE_ their balls right off . STO
* '' His arm moved swiftly , violently , once , twice . STO
* He felt intense satisfaction . STO
* He was _RARE_ within . STO
* Before him , _RARE_ , bleeding to death , they lay . STO
* It was as if it had been done . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , he said aloud , _RARE_ on them . STO
* He halted , and looked around . STO
* _RARE_ of cold sweat were suddenly _RARE_ within him . STO
* The thought came back , the one nagging at him these past four days . STO
* He tried to _RARE_ it . STO
* But the words were forming . STO
* He knew he couldn't . STO
* He _RARE_ himself . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ start _RARE_ . STO
* He fought it , seeking to kill the last few words , but on they came out . STO
* He was trembling , a strange feeling upon him , fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot . STO
* But it didn't . STO
* And he took heart ; ; the final word came forth . STO
* Now he heard it , fully ; ; `` _RARE_ _RARE_ his place '' He listened , waited , nothing happened . STO
* He felt good . STO
* His old self . STO
* The music arrived , taking him its rhythm . STO
* _RARE_ him , _RARE_ all through him , the _RARE_ lifted him , took him from one magic _RARE_ to another , stopping briefly at each Brandon . STO
* He is good . STO
* Damn good . STO
* But a nigger . STO
* Johnson . STO
* Jesus , the guy says he is trying . STO
* But he isn't with it , not at all with it . STO
* When I talked to _RARE_ about it , he said , Everyone can learn , if he is not a _RARE_ or lazy . STO
* No one is stupid . STO
* That's what he said . STO
* He _RARE_ know . STO
* It is plain as hell Johnson is no reactionary . STO
* So you're not _RARE_ , Johnson , you bastard you . STO
* He looked over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a wave of _RARE_ . STO
* How he _RARE_ him . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ Johnson , _RARE_ _RARE_ in my side of the whole fucken squad . STO
* He was the guy what always _RARE_ at _RARE_ Time . STO
* Why couldn't they have dumped him off on someone else ? STO
* Why me ? STO
* Why didn't the damn _RARE_ _RARE_ him off ? STO
* Why Slater ? STO
* Like a particle drawn to a _RARE_ he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind . STO
* The music surged up , but it failed to check it . STO
* Who is the man to take His place ? STO
* The guy with most on the _RARE_ . STO
* Most on the ball . STO
* _RARE_ men . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ up . STO
* _RARE_ the score With a supreme effort , he broke it off . STO
* He turned to the window again . STO
* A _RARE_ and _RARE_ within him . STO
* The snow was _RARE_ down furiously now . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ hitting the ground , _RARE_ higher and higher . STO
* He stared at it , amazed , alarmed . STO
* The whole fucken _RARE_ _RARE_ in ! STO
* _RARE_ ! STO
* _RARE_ it ! STO
* _RARE_ the whole building , _RARE_ us all , by _RARE_ . STO
* Jesus ! STO
* Somebody , got to be somebody If I don't put my two cents in soon , somebody else will I know they're _RARE_ only for one thing : for the bastards what done it to be _RARE_ . STO
* Maybe they already got them . STO
* He was again _RARE_ with pleasure , seeing himself clearly in _RARE_ shoes . STO
* _RARE_ dog , sleeping and eating right there with the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ , all of them . STO
* _RARE_ dog . STO
* Poor _RARE_ Slater . STO
* Jesus , imagine , the _RARE_ bastards , they'll get _RARE_ , they'll get what's _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ about suddenly . STO
* It was nothing , though his heart was _RARE_ wildly . STO
* Somebody was up . STO
* That was all . STO
* `` _RARE_ , you're _RARE_ early '' , a sleepy voice said . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , said Coughlin , _RARE_ , _RARE_ him up and down . STO
* `` _RARE_ that come down , _RARE_ '' , said the man , scratching himself , _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , said Coughlin , practically _RARE_ on him . STO
* The man moved away . STO
* That's the way . STO
* They'll _RARE_ the line . STO
* _RARE_ it . STO
* Keep the chatter to a minimum , short answers , one word , if possible . STO
* Less bull the more you can do with _RARE_ . STO
* That's Brown's trouble . STO
* All he does is to _RARE_ with his squad , and they are the _RARE_ bastards around . STO
* Just about to get their _RARE_ kicked into hut Seven . STO
* _RARE_ of room there now . STO
* All those dumb _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* You can do anything with these dumb _RARE_ if you know how . STO
* Anything . STO
* They'd cut their _RARE_ belly open . STO
* Give _RARE_ the works . STO
* See , he's already snapping it up , the dumb _RARE_ . STO
* Coughlin grinned , feeling _RARE_ on top of things . STO
* He watched the snow once again . STO
* It _RARE_ him . STO
* It made no sense to him . STO
* He _RARE_ around , suddenly hot all over , finding the man who had been standing before him a few moments back , _RARE_ him to the spot on which he now stood , _RARE_ . STO
* `` You , Listen ! STO
* -- name William _RARE_ Four Internal _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ -- _RARE_ -- now '' ! STO
* The man _RARE_ before the hot fury , searching frantically for the answer . STO
* _RARE_ woke up . STO
* There was a hell of a noise this time of morning . STO
* He stared out the window . STO
* For Christ's sake ! STO
* The whole fucken _RARE_ _RARE_ in ! STO
* He looked for the source of the noise that had _RARE_ him . STO
* It was that _RARE_ Coughlin . STO
* What the hell was he up to now ? STO
* Why didn't he drop dead ? STO
* How did they miss him when they got Slater ? STO
* How ? STO
* Then he was asking himself the usual early morning questions : What the Hell am I _RARE_ here ? STO
* Is this a _RARE_ ? STO
* _RARE_ I _RARE_ ? STO
* Is this for real ? STO
* _RARE_ I _RARE_ ? STO
* From somewhere in the hut came _RARE_ voice . STO
* `` How long did you study ? STO
* How long , buddy '' ? STO
* `` For Christ's sake '' ! STO
* A voice _RARE_ . STO
* `` Don't _RARE_ me , buddy ! STO
* Just answer . STO
* _RARE_ -- _RARE_ ! STO
* '' I'm no hero . STO
* Did I start the damn war ? STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ started going over today's lesson . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ from the core . STO
* Did I start the damn war ? STO
* Who did ? STO
* That's a good one . STO
* I thought I knew . STO
* Why don't Uncle Sam mind his own fucken business ? STO
* I'll bet both together did . STO
* I bet . STO
* So _RARE_ them both . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Just let me go home to Jersey , back to the shore , oh , Jesus , the shore . STO
* The waves _RARE_ in on you and your girl at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight . STO
* If I _RARE_ do this to stay alive by God I'll do it . STO
* I hated the goddamn army from the first day I got in anyhow . STO
* All _RARE_ like Coughlin run it anyway , one way or another . STO
* _RARE_ them . STO
* He rolled over and tried to shut out the noise , now much louder . STO
* He _RARE_ into the blanket . STO
* Brandon dreamed . STO
* He was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water . STO
* A river , wide as the Missouri , where it ran by his place . STO
* The log was spinning . STO
* But he was not . STO
* So what ? STO
* Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning ? STO
* ( he asked this out loud , but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut ) . STO
* Over on the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him . STO
* He couldn't make out what he was saying . STO
* No doubt it had to do with the log . STO
* Why should he be concerned ? STO
* Rousseau is so _RARE_ that Voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books , too . STO
* But while the two men are riding into the country , where they are going to dinner , they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of thieves , who strip them of everything , including most of their clothes . STO
* `` You must be a very learned man '' , says Voltaire to one of the _RARE_ . STO
* `` A learned man '' ? STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ in his face . STO
* But Voltaire _RARE_ . STO
* He goes to the chief himself . STO
* `` At what university did you study '' ? STO
* He asks . STO
* He _RARE_ to believe that the _RARE_ chief never attended a higher institution . STO
* `` To have become so _RARE_ '' , he says , `` surely you must have studied many arts and sciences '' . STO
* The chief , annoyed by these questions , _RARE_ Voltaire down and shouts at him that he not only never went to any school , but never even learned how to read . STO
* When finally the two _RARE_ men reach their _RARE_ home , _RARE_ fears are once again aroused . STO
* For it is such a distinguished place , with such fine works of art and such a big library , that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become _RARE_ by all this culture . STO
* To _RARE_ surprise , however , their host gives them fresh clothes to put on , opens his purse to _RARE_ them money and _RARE_ them down before a good dinner . STO
* _RARE_ after dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor . STO
* Could he have pen and paper , please ? STO
* He is in a hurry to write another _RARE_ against culture . STO
* Such was the _RARE_ that Voltaire gave to _RARE_ of laughter at _RARE_ _RARE_ and that was soon _RARE_ in _RARE_ throughout the literary circles of Europe , to be printed _RARE_ later , but with the name of _RARE_ of _RARE_ , the famous _RARE_ , substituted for that of Rousseau . STO
* How cruel ! STO
* But at the same time how understandable . STO
* How could the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the _RARE_ , the lies , the _RARE_ , the errors , _RARE_ and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life ? STO
* How , for example , could a Voltaire understand the strange _RARE_ in which a Rousseau would find himself when , soon after the _RARE_ of his first _RARE_ , he acquired still another title to _RARE_ ? STO
* This time as a _RARE_ . STO
* As a composer . STO
* Ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it , Rousseau had dreamed of _RARE_ through to _RARE_ as the result of a successful opera . STO
* But his _RARE_ in this _RARE_ was not great . STO
* And his efforts to get a performance for his _RARE_ _RARE_ invariably failed . STO
* And for good reasons . STO
* His _RARE_ music had little merit . STO
* But then one day , while on a _RARE_ visit to the country home of a retired _RARE_ _RARE_ , Rousseau amused the company with a few little _RARE_ he had written , to which he attached no great importance . STO
* He was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs . STO
* `` Put a few such songs together '' , they urged him . STO
* `` _RARE_ them onto some sort of little plot , and you'll have a _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* He didn't believe them . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , he said . STO
* `` This is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away '' ! STO
* `` Heaven _RARE_ '' ! STO
* _RARE_ the ladies , _RARE_ by his music . STO
* `` You must make an opera out of this material '' . STO
* And they wouldn't leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised . STO
* Oh , the irony and the bitterness of it ! STO
* That after all his years of effort to become a composer , he should now , now when he was still _RARE_ _RARE_ to the critics of his _RARE_ on the _RARE_ and _RARE_ , be so close to a success in music and have to _RARE_ it . STO
* Or at least appear to _RARE_ it ! STO
* But what else could he do ? STO
* You couldn't on the one hand _RARE_ the arts and at the same time practice them , could you ? STO
* Well , yes , perhaps in literature , since you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself . STO
* But now music too ? STO
* No . STO
* That would be too much ! STO
* And the fault , of course , was _RARE_ . STO
* The fault was _RARE_ and that of the whole culture of this _RARE_ age . STO
* For it was _RARE_ type of music that he had been trying to write , and that he couldn't write . STO
* These little songs , however , were sweet _RARE_ from the heart , tender _RARE_ of his childhood , little _RARE_ that anyone could _RARE_ and that would make one want to weep . STO
* But no . STO
* He couldn't appear as a composer now . STO
* That glory , _RARE_ for so long , was now _RARE_ to him . STO
* Still , just for the ladies , and just for this once , for this one weekend in the country , he would make a little piece out of his _RARE_ . STO
* The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was _RARE_ . STO
* And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote . STO
* But then , after the little _RARE_ had been given its feeble _RARE_ rendering , everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever , and that the _RARE_ Academy of Music must now have the _RARE_ in order to give it the really _RARE_ performance it _RARE_ . STO
* Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a _RARE_ , standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance . STO
* The ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him . STO
* A contradiction ? STO
* _RARE_ , what was a contradiction in one's life ? STO
* Every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes , and saying yes when she meant no . STO
* Rousseau had to admit that though he couldn't agree to a public performance , he would indeed , just for his own private satisfaction , _RARE_ love to know how his work would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices . STO
* `` I'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to think '' , he said . STO
* Duclos , the _RARE_ , pointed out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible . STO
* The musicians of the _RARE_ _RARE_ would not _RARE_ a work merely to see how it would sound . STO
* _RARE_ to satisfy the _RARE_ curiosity . STO
* Rousseau agreed . STO
* But he recalled that _RARE_ had once had a private performance of his opera _RARE_ , behind closed doors , just for himself alone . STO
* Duclos understood what was bothering Rousseau : that the writer of the _RARE_ of _RARE_ should now become known as the writer of an amusing little _RARE_ . STO
* That would certainly be _RARE_ . STO
* But Duclos thought he saw a way out . STO
* `` Let me do the _RARE_ to the _RARE_ Academy '' , he suggested . STO
* `` Your name will never appear . STO
* No one will even suspect that it is your work '' . STO
* To that Rousseau could agree . STO
* But now what crazy _RARE_ and turns of his emotions ! STO
* _RARE_ at one and the same time that his work might be turned down -- which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author -- and that the work would be accepted , and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly _RARE_ how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself . STO
* And how anxious this lover of _RARE_ was for applause ! STO
* And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for _RARE_ , Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks . STO
* All these emotions were _RARE_ up to new heights when , after acceptance and the first _RARE_ , there _RARE_ such a _RARE_ of excitement among _RARE_ music _RARE_ that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to _RARE_ him that the news had reached the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of _RARE_ . STO
* Imagine the honor of it ! STO
* `` What was your answer '' ? STO
* Jean Jacques asked , _RARE_ to appear _RARE_ . STO
* `` I refused '' , Duclos said . STO
* `` What else could I do ? STO
* Monsieur De _RARE_ was _RARE_ , of course . STO
* But I said I would first have to get the _RARE_ permission . STO
* And I was certain he would refuse '' . STO
* How _RARE_ all this was ! STO
* Why had not this success come to him before he had plunged into his _RARE_ , and before he had committed himself to a life of _RARE_ and denial ? STO
* Now , when everything was opening up to him -- even the court of Louis 15 ! STO
* -- he had to play a role of _RARE_ . STO
* Back and forth Duclos had to go , between M. De _RARE_ and Jean Jacques and between the _RARE_ _RARE_ and Jean Jacques again , as his little _RARE_ , The Village _RARE_ , though still _RARE_ , took on ever more importance . STO
* And of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his _RARE_ friends . STO
* But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles . STO
* How _RARE_ it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most _RARE_ terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ was such that people who could not possibly have _RARE_ their way into the _RARE_ were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be _RARE_ . STO
* And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of _RARE_ in a cafe , Rousseau found himself _RARE_ in _RARE_ , trembling lest his _RARE_ become known , and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer . STO
* He felt himself now , as he himself says in his _RARE_ , at a crucial point of his life . STO
* And that was why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal _RARE_ called to take him to the palace , he did not bother to _RARE_ . STO
* On the contrary , he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days . STO
* Seeing him in that condition , and about to enter the hall where the King , the _RARE_ , the whole royal family and all the members of the highest _RARE_ would be present , _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ and others tried to stop him . STO
* `` You can't go in that way '' ! STO
* They cried . STO
* `` Why not '' ? STO
* Jean Jacques asked . STO
* `` Who is going to stop me '' ? STO
* `` You haven't dressed for the occasion '' ! STO
* They pointed out to him . STO
* `` I'm dressed as I always am '' , Rousseau said . STO
* `` Neither better nor worse '' . STO
* `` At home , yes '' , they argued . STO
* `` But here you are in the palace . STO
* There's the King . STO
* And Madame De _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` If they are here , then surely I have the right to be here '' , Rousseau said . STO
* `` And even more right . STO
* Since I am the composer '' ! STO
* `` But in such a _RARE_ condition '' . STO
* `` What is _RARE_ about me '' ? STO
* Rousseau asked . STO
* `` Is it because of my _RARE_ that hair grows on my face ? STO
* Surely it would grow there whether I washed myself or not . STO
* A hundred years ago I would have worn a beard with pride . STO
* And those without _RARE_ would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion . STO
* Now times have changed , and I must pretend that hair doesn't grow on my face . STO
* That's the fashion . STO
* And fashion is the real king here . STO
* Not Louis 15 , , since even he _RARE_ . STO
* Now , if you don't mind , I should like to hear my own piece performed '' . STO
* But of course behind his _RARE_ he didn't feel bold at all . STO
* He trembled lest his piece should fail . STO
* And this in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society , his fear of making some _RARE_ or _RARE_ remark . STO
* And even deeper than that : his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly _RARE_ to _RARE_ himself . STO
* Could he walk out in the midst of his piece ? STO
* Here , before the court ? STO
* Before the King ? STO
* It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began . STO
* The rider from _RARE_ was as good as his word . STO
* He came _RARE_ and _RARE_ down the road , his horse kicking up clouds of dust , shouting : `` They're _RARE_ ! STO
* By God , they're _RARE_ , they are '' ! STO
* We heard him before he ever showed , and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight . STO
* _RARE_ Chandler hadn't _RARE_ the strength of his lungs , not at all . STO
* I think you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every _RARE_ with importance . STO
* I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man , and when a very small man is up on a saddle , he'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there . STO
* That's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment . STO
* As for this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I can't say ; ; but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction . STO
* The last thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of _RARE_ and _RARE_ and mechanics _RARE_ on top of a stone wall , and this _RARE_ rider made us feel a good deal _RARE_ and more alert to the situation . STO
* We came down off the wall as if he had _RARE_ all of us , and we crouched behind it . STO
* I have heard people talk with contempt about the British _RARE_ , but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Whatever we felt about the redcoats , we respected them in terms of their trade , which was killing ; ; and I know that I , myself , was _RARE_ with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun . STO
* I wanted to wipe my _RARE_ , but I didn't dare to , the state my hands were in , just as I didn't dare to do anything about the _RARE_ . STO
* The gun would fire or not , just as chance _RARE_ . STO
* I put a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun , because the most important thing I had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it . STO
* The gunfire , which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now , stopped for long enough to count to twenty ; ; and in that brief interval , a redcoat officer came tearing down the road , whipping his horse fit to kill . STO
* I don't know whether he was after our rider , who had gone by a minute before , or whether he was simply _RARE_ conditions ; ; but when he passed us by , a musket roared , and he reared his horse , swung it around , and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come . STO
* He was a fine and _RARE_ rider , but his skill was wasted on us . STO
* From above me and somewhere behind me , a rifle cracked . STO
* The redcoat officer collapsed like a _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle , except that one _RARE_ foot caught in the _RARE_ . STO
* Half _RARE_ by the weight dragging , the dust , and the heat , the horse leaped our wall , _RARE_ out the _RARE_ brains against it , and leaving him lying there among us -- while the horse crashed away through the brush . STO
* It was my _RARE_ to war and the insane _RARE_ war plays ; ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become . STO
* And now the redcoats were coming , and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us . STO
* I must state that the faster things happened , the _RARE_ they happened ; ; the passage and rhythm of time changed , and when I remember back to what happened then , each event is a separate and frozen incident . STO
* In my _RARE_ , there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the _RARE_ redcoats , and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to _RARE_ indefinitely . STO
* Yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds , and then the front of the British army came into view . STO
* It was only hours since I had last seen them , but they had changed and I had changed . STO
* In the very front rank , two men were wounded and staggered along , _RARE_ blood behind them . STO
* No _RARE_ here , no _RARE_ , and the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust . STO
* They _RARE_ with _RARE_ fixed , and as fixed on their faces was anger , fear , and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ after rank of them came down the road , and the faces were all the same , and they walked in a sea of dust . STO
* `` _RARE_ , hold your fire ! STO
* Hold your fire '' ! STO
* A voice called , and what made it even more terrible and _RARE_ was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant , only some of them glancing toward the stone wall , from behind which the voice came . STO
* The front of their column had already passed us , when another officer came riding down the side of the road , not five _RARE_ from where we were . STO
* My Cousin Simmons carried a musket , but he had loaded it with bird shot , and as the officer came opposite him , he rose up behind the wall and fired . STO
* One moment there was a man in the saddle ; ; the next a _RARE_ horror on a horse that _RARE_ through the redcoat ranks , and during the next second or two , we all of us fired into the suddenly _RARE_ column of soldiers . STO
* One moment , the road was filled with _RARE_ _RARE_ , marching four by four with a purpose as _RARE_ as death ; ; the next , a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming fury of sound , out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their _RARE_ and their cursing fury . STO
* In the course of this , they had fired on us ; ; but I have no memory of that . STO
* I had squeezed the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry _RARE_ ; ; and then I was adding my own voice to the _RARE_ of sound , _RARE_ more _RARE_ language than I ever thought I knew , _RARE_ and shouting , and aware that if I had passed water before , it was not enough , for my pants were soaking wet . STO
* I would have stood there and died there if left to myself , but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his _RARE_ grip and fairly _RARE_ me out of there ; ; and then I came to some _RARE_ and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I _RARE_ Cousin Simmons by far . STO
* Everyone else was running . STO
* Later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall . STO
* Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching . STO
* We tumbled to a stop in _RARE_ _RARE_ cow hole , a _RARE_ bit of _RARE_ with a muddy pool of water in its middle . STO
* A dozen _RARE_ _RARE_ sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the _RARE_ of some of the men , which was so great that they _RARE_ into the muddy water and _RARE_ up _RARE_ of it . STO
* Isaac _RARE_ , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and _RARE_ his hot brow . STO
* It may appear that we were cruel and _RARE_ , but no one had time to spend _RARE_ with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend . STO
* I know that I myself felt that it was a _RARE_ shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball , as Isaac had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself . STO
* I was drunk with excitement and the smell of _RARE_ that came floating down from the road , and the fact that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next . STO
* Meanwhile , I _RARE_ my gun , as the other men were doing . STO
* We were less than a quarter of a mile from the road , and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it . STO
* _RARE_ you looked , you saw _RARE_ running across the _RARE_ , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; ; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty _RARE_ were making their way in our direction . STO
* Cousin _RARE_ and some others felt that we should _RARE_ toward _RARE_ and take up new positions ahead of the _RARE_ British column , but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road . STO
* I didn't offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out . STO
* Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; ; but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much _RARE_ pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass , what with the _RARE_ of the road and their _RARE_ and ammunition _RARE_ . STO
* While this was being discussed , we saw the _RARE_ to the west of us _RARE_ out and breaking into little _RARE_ of two and three men as they approached the road . STO
* It was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the _RARE_ who had been in the _RARE_ of the North Bridge , which entitled them to a sort of veteran status , and we felt that if they employed this _RARE_ , it was likely enough the best one . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ said : `` It makes sense . STO
* If we cluster together , the redcoats can make an advantage out of it , but there's not a _RARE_ thing they can do with two or three of us except _RARE_ us , and we can _RARE_ them '' . STO
* That settled it , and we broke into parties of two and three . STO
* Cousin _RARE_ _RARE_ decided to remain with the Reverend and poor Isaac _RARE_ until life passed away -- and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world . STO
* I went off with Cousin Simmons , who maintained that if he didn't see to me , he didn't know who would . STO
* `` Good _RARE_ , Adam '' , he said , `` I thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place '' . STO
* `` I learned that now '' , I said . STO
* We ran east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road , panting from the effort and soaked with sweat . STO
* There was a _RARE_ of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road , and the shouting and gunfire never _RARE_ . STO
* Under the trees , there was a dead redcoat , a young boy with a _RARE_ white skin and a face full of _RARE_ , who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes . STO
* Three men were around him . STO
* They had stripped him of his musket and equipment , and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off . STO
* Cousin Simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away . STO
* `` God's name , what are you to _RARE_ the dead with the fight going on '' ! STO
* Cousin Simmons roared . STO
* They tried to _RARE_ him , but Joseph Simmons was as wide as two average men , and it would have taken _RARE_ men than these were to _RARE_ him . STO
* That summer the gambling houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre _RARE_ , a _RARE_ manufacturer . STO
* _RARE_ was no longer permitted in the streets . STO
* The _RARE_ and other places of _RARE_ were _RARE_ . STO
* The slit _RARE_ had to go . STO
* _RARE_ was no longer _RARE_ . STO
* In _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ , Jake _RARE_ , _RARE_ down the _RARE_ in St. Peter's one Sunday morning , followed by one of the women from the _RARE_ , whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame . STO
* _RARE_ themselves down on the front bench , they turned to _RARE_ at those around them . STO
* John's first impulse was to _RARE_ their _RARE_ . STO
* But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him . STO
* _RARE_ he opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well . STO
* He finished the worship service as if there had been no _RARE_ attempt to _RARE_ God and man . STO
* The next morning , as the clock struck nine , he appeared at the Council meeting in the _RARE_ Hall and insisted that the couple would have to be punished if the Church was to be respected . STO
* `` I have told you before , and I tell you again '' , Monsieur Favre said _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ to the preaching of the _RARE_ '' ! STO
* John stiffened in anger . STO
* `` That is the answer the _RARE_ will always make when the Church points its fingers at their _RARE_ . STO
* I say to you that the Church will ever _RARE_ evil '' ! STO
* John's reply was like a _RARE_ of war . STO
* Monsieur Favre sat down in his _RARE_ stall , lips compressed , eyes _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , a short man with a _RARE_ of stomach , rose . STO
* Every eye was on him as he began to speak . STO
* `` What _RARE_ _RARE_ says is true . STO
* How can we have a good city unless we respect morality '' ? STO
* Abel _RARE_ , a tall man with _RARE_ cheeks and _RARE_ eyes , got to his feet . STO
* `` We all know that Jake _RARE_ and the woman are _RARE_ living together . STO
* It would be well to show the _RARE_ how we deal with _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , the son of the famous _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* `` Do not listen to that _RARE_ . STO
* He is _RARE_ the liberty my father gave his life to win '' ! STO
* John was quietly insistent . STO
* `` There can be no _RARE_ when souls are in _RARE_ '' . STO
* A week later the sentence of the Council was carried out : Jake _RARE_ and the woman were _RARE_ naked through the streets past a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Before them stalked the _RARE_ , _RARE_ as he went , `` Thus the Council deals with those who break its laws -- _RARE_ , thieves , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ persons . STO
* Let _RARE_ _RARE_ their ways , and let every man _RARE_ '' ! STO
* John's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just received from his sister Mary . STO
* Charles had died two weeks before , in early November , without being _RARE_ to the Church . STO
* The _RARE_ , in a body , had tried to force him on his _RARE_ to let them give him the last _RARE_ of the Church , but he had died still _RARE_ _RARE_ by faith . STO
* _RARE_ had taken place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the _RARE_ , so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug up and burned . STO
* The _RARE_ of St. _RARE_ , _RARE_ De _RARE_ , had been a good friend , but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in _RARE_ ground . STO
* John closed his eyes and saw once again the little _RARE_ in his mother's bedroom , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs . STO
* The _RARE_ Virgin was still there , but no one knelt before her now . STO
* Not even _RARE_ ; ; she , too , prayed only to God . STO
* For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of _RARE_ , the touch of his mother's hand , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ voice in the square _RARE_ rooms , his father's bass tones _RARE_ to the _RARE_ , and the sight of the beloved _RARE_ . STO
* But he had to follow the light . STO
* Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy _RARE_ , why had He given them to him ? STO
* The _RARE_ trees stood like _RARE_ in the February night . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ the streets and covered the _RARE_ _RARE_ , as John _RARE_ toward St. Peter's . STO
* A carriage _RARE_ by , its dim lights _RARE_ through the gloom . STO
* The sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow _RARE_ the holes of his shoes , his only ones , now _RARE_ with folded _RARE_ . STO
* The city had recently given him a small salary , but it was not enough to supply even _RARE_ . STO
* As he _RARE_ the square , a round figure muffled in a long , black _RARE_ _RARE_ by . STO
* John recognized _RARE_ _RARE_ and called out a _RARE_ . STO
* How grateful he was to such men ! STO
* There were several on the Council who tried to live like _RARE_ . STO
* Despite their efforts , the problems seemed to grow _RARE_ all the time . STO
* _RARE_ his steps , John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells . STO
* _RARE_ the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead _RARE_ , and on the smaller bell , the _RARE_ , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air . STO
* John leaned upon the stone _RARE_ . STO
* He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his _RARE_ cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes . STO
* Below the _RARE_ world rolled away to _RARE_ white _RARE_ ; ; above him the deep blue sky _RARE_ with stars . STO
* He stood very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the _RARE_ , then down at the _RARE_ lights below . STO
* `` How long , my Lord ? STO
* How long ? STO
* I have never asked for an easy task , but I am weary of the _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ was difficult these days . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ him . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ were frequent . STO
* _RARE_ tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of Peter Robert , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , Martin _RARE_ , and even the _RARE_ Louis Du _RARE_ . STO
* An occasional _RARE_ from Italy brought news of Peter Robert , who was now _RARE_ his Bible among the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ came regularly from _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Martin . STO
* He had Anthony and William to _RARE_ in and consult . STO
* But William continued to find a bitter joy in _RARE_ images and tearing down symbols sacred to the Old Church . STO
* John found it difficult , but he held him in check . STO
* And Anthony was busy most of the time _RARE_ this girl and that . STO
* His easy good looks made him a favorite with the ladies . STO
* _RARE_ , instead of becoming the City of God , as John had dreamed , had in the two years since he had been there , continued to be a _RARE_ place where all manner of vice _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ poured in , _RARE_ the _RARE_ and rules in order to remain , and then _RARE_ them . STO
* _RARE_ rolled , _RARE_ _RARE_ their trade , thieves _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ who were truly _RARE_ longed for the simple _RARE_ of days gone by . STO
* _RARE_ recalled the _RARE_ of the past and demanded : `` Are we going to allow the _RARE_ Pope , _RARE_ _RARE_ , to _RARE_ our liberty ? STO
* Why , oh why , doesn't he stick to preaching the _RARE_ , instead of _RARE_ in civic affairs , politics , economics , and social issues that are no concern of the Church '' ? STO
* And John's reply was always the same : `` Anything that affects souls is the concern of the Church ! STO
* We will have _RARE_ '' ! STO
* _RARE_ burned behind his eyes as he prayed and _RARE_ tonight . STO
* Unless the confusion cleared , he would not be coming here much longer . STO
* Monsieur _RARE_ threat would become a reality , for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that _RARE_ '' . STO
* The slow _RARE_ of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ at first , the _RARE_ grew until it sounded loud against the wind . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ ! STO
* John thought . STO
* What is he doing here at this hour ? STO
* He started down the steps to meet the _RARE_ preacher , who had been one of the early _RARE_ in Paris . STO
* `` John ? STO
* Is that you ? STO
* I came to _RARE_ you of a plot '' ! STO
* John stood above him , his face _RARE_ . STO
* What now ? STO
* Slowly , like a man grown old , he took _RARE_ hand and led him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little _RARE_ where a fire still burned . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* John asked _RARE_ . STO
* `` Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit . STO
* I went to your rooms , and Anthony told me you were here . STO
* Two _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , are to challenge you and William to a debate before the Council . STO
* It is to be a trap . STO
* You know the law : if you lose the debate after accepting a challenge , you will be _RARE_ '' ! STO
* `` What will be the subject '' ? STO
* `` You are to be accused of _RARE_ to _RARE_ the religious who remain loyal '' . STO
* _RARE_ and fear _RARE_ in John . STO
* Ever since the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of Christ . STO
* Those who refused to believe that He was the eternal _RARE_ of God were termed _RARE_ . STO
* Peter _RARE_ had come to _RARE_ , saying that he had been a _RARE_ of the Church of Rome and had been _RARE_ in Paris for his _RARE_ faith . STO
* He asked to be appointed a preacher . STO
* But _RARE_ _RARE_ had _RARE_ him , revealing he had never been a _RARE_ , but was an _RARE_ , afraid to state his faith , because he knew John _RARE_ had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death . STO
* So John had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now _RARE_ sought _RARE_ . STO
* John sighed . STO
* `` If William agrees , we should insist on a public debate '' , he said at length . STO
* `` There is more to the conspiracy . STO
* Bern demands that the Lord's Supper be administered here as it used to be , with _RARE_ bread . STO
* Furthermore , Bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council , _RARE_ only the word of God and stop _RARE_ in politics '' ! STO
* `` It was always the spirit with Christ ; ; matters such as _RARE_ or _RARE_ bread are _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ must remain a sovereign state . STO
* We will not yield to the demands of Bern '' ! STO
* The _RARE_ played over _RARE_ flowing white _RARE_ and _RARE_ features . STO
* `` Monsieur Favre indicated that if I would _RARE_ , after you and William are _RARE_ , following the debate , I will be given a place of influence '' . STO
* `` What was your reply to that '' ? STO
* `` That I would rather be _RARE_ with two such _RARE_ than be made the Chief _RARE_ '' ! STO
* The following morning , as John entered the Place _RARE_ on his way to visit a sick refugee , he had a _RARE_ of danger . STO
* Then suddenly a group of men and dogs circled him . STO
* He wanted to run , but he knew that if he did , he would be lost . STO
* He stood very still , his heart _RARE_ wildly . STO
* On the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ the _RARE_ brothers and _RARE_ Favre shook their fists . STO
* `` Are you going to _RARE_ with the demands of Bern '' ? STO
* The _RARE_ Jake called . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* A _RARE_ with a big _RARE_ of a nose roared . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* John lifted his hand for silence . STO
* `` _RARE_ this : the _RARE_ will not yield to the demands of Bern '' . STO
* His voice shook a little . STO
* Somebody _RARE_ a stone . STO
* For an instant John was stunned . STO
* When he felt the side of his head , his fingers came away covered with blood . STO
* Before he could duck , another stone struck him . STO
* And another . STO
* `` Let him be now '' ! STO
* Pierre _RARE_ , the _RARE_ manufacturer said , his little pig eyes _RARE_ . STO
* `` We have taught him a lesson '' . STO
* The crowd moved back and John started _RARE_ down the hill . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ him as he staggered forward . STO
* Then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow . STO
* At once a _RARE_ of dogs was snapping and _RARE_ around him . STO
* One , more horrible than the rest , _RARE_ , _RARE_ deep in his throat , his hair _RARE_ . STO
* With great difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run , sweat pouring down his face . STO
* _RARE_ in the shelter of the tent -- a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no longer _RARE_ -- Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the _RARE_ counter of boards laid across two beer _RARE_ . STO
* There was , of course , no real need to _RARE_ everything . STO
* A quarter inch this way or that for the _RARE_ , or the _RARE_ , or the _RARE_ sugar , or the _RARE_ , or the _RARE_ , or the condensed milk , or the _RARE_ , or the _RARE_ -- what could it mean ? STO
* Adam watched his own hands make the _RARE_ , anxious movement that , when rain falls and nobody comes , and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the _RARE_ , has been the _RARE_ of stall _RARE_ , forever . STO
* He recognized the gesture . STO
* He knew its meaning . STO
* He had seen a dry , old , _RARE_ hand reach out , with that painful _RARE_ , to touch , to _RARE_ , to shift _RARE_ , some object worth a _RARE_ . STO
* Back in _RARE_ he had seen that gesture , and at that sight his heart had always died within him . STO
* On such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand , whatever face it might be . STO
* Now the face was his own . STO
* He wondered what expression , as he made that gesture , was on his face . STO
* He wondered if it wore the old anxiety , or the old , taut _RARE_ . STO
* But there was no need , he remembered , for his hand to reach out , for his face to show concern or _RARE_ . STO
* It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came . STO
* Then why was he assuming the role -- the gesture and the suffering ? STO
* What was he _RARE_ ? STO
* Or was he now taking the role -- the gesture and the suffering -- because it was the only way to _RARE_ his history and identity in the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ of this land . STO
* This was Virginia . STO
* He looked out of the tent at the company street . STO
* The rain dripped on the freezing _RARE_ of the street . STO
* Beyond that _RARE_ gray of the rain , he saw the stretching _RARE_ , low _RARE_ log _RARE_ , _RARE_ with mud , with _RARE_ a man would have to _RARE_ to get through , with _RARE_ of _RARE_ laid over _RARE_ or boards from _RARE_ boxes , or fence rails , with _RARE_ _RARE_ of sticks and dried mud . STO
* The chimney of the hut across from him was _RARE_ by a beef barrel with ends knocked out . STO
* In this heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help . STO
* The smoke from that chimney rose as _RARE_ as smoke from any other , and hung as sadly in the drizzle , creeping back down along the _RARE_ canvas of the roof . STO
* Over the door was a board with large , _RARE_ _RARE_ : home sweet home . STO
* This was the hut of Simms Purdew , the hero . STO
* The men were huddled in those _RARE_ . STO
* Adam knew the names of some . STO
* He knew the faces of all , _RARE_ or _RARE_ , old or young , fat or thin , suffering or _RARE_ , sad or gay , good or bad . STO
* When they stood about his tent , _RARE_ each other , _RARE_ their _RARE_ , cursing command or weather , he had studied their faces . STO
* He had had the need to understand what life _RARE_ behind the mask of flesh , behind the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ . STO
* Once _RARE_ looking at Simms Purdew , the only man in the world whom he hated , he had seen the heavy , _RARE_ , _RARE_ jaw open and close to _RARE_ the cruel , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and had seen the _RARE_ eyes go _RARE_ with whisky and _RARE_ , and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that _RARE_ creature . STO
* He was seeing , somehow , the face of a young boy , the boy Simms Purdew must once have been , a boy with _RARE_ hair , and blue eyes dancing with _RARE_ , and the boy mouth grinning _RARE_ among the _RARE_ . STO
* In that moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying : I must not hate him , I must not hate him or I shall die . STO
* His heart suddenly opened to joy . STO
* He thought that if once , only once , he could talk with Simms Purdew , something about his own life , and all life , would be clear and simple . STO
* If Simms Purdew would turn to him and say : `` Adam , you know when I was a boy , it was a funny thing happened . STO
* _RARE_ tell you now '' -- If only Simms Purdew could do that , whatever the thing he remembered and told . STO
* It would be a sign for the _RARE_ , and he , Adam , would understand . STO
* Now , Adam , in the gray light of afternoon , stared across at the hut opposite his tent , and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom , snoring on his bunk , with the _RARE_ of whisky choking the air . STO
* He saw the sign above the door of the hut : home sweet home . STO
* He saw the figure of a man in a _RARE_ coming up the company street , with an _RARE_ of wood . STO
* It was _RARE_ James , the _RARE_ of Simms Purdew . STO
* He carried the wood , carried the water , did the cooking , cleaning and _RARE_ , and occasionally got a kick in the butt for his _RARE_ . STO
* Adam watched the moisture flow from the _RARE_ . STO
* It gave the _RARE_ fabric a dull _RARE_ , like metal . STO
* _RARE_ James _RARE_ lowered his head , pushed aside the _RARE_ door of the hut , and was gone from sight . STO
* Adam stared at the door and remembered that Simms Purdew had been _RARE_ the _RARE_ of _RARE_ for _RARE_ at _RARE_ . STO
* The street was again empty . STO
* The drizzle was _RARE_ off now , but the light was _RARE_ . STO
* With enormous interest , Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the street , and his spirit , moved a form . STO
* The form was _RARE_ in an army blanket , much _RARE_ , _RARE_ at the neck with a cord . STO
* From under the _RARE_ _RARE_ of blanket the feet moved in the mud . STO
* The feet wore army shoes , in obvious _RARE_ . STO
* The head was wrapped in a _RARE_ and on top of the _RARE_ rode a great _RARE_ across which a piece of _RARE_ had been flung . STO
* The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle . STO
* _RARE_ ran down the cheeks , gathered at the tip of the nose , and at the chin . STO
* The figure was close enough now for him to see the nose _RARE_ to _RARE_ the drop _RARE_ there . STO
* The figure stopped and one hand was _RARE_ freed from the _RARE_ to scratch the nose . STO
* Then the figure moved on . STO
* This was one of the _RARE_ women who had built their own huts down near the river . STO
* They did washing . STO
* Adam recognized this one . STO
* He recognized her because she was the one who , in a winter _RARE_ , on the edge of camp , had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly . STO
* `` _RARE_ o' _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She had _RARE_ in her soft _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ o' _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Her name was Mollie . STO
* They called her Mollie the Mutton , and laughed . STO
* _RARE_ down the street after her , Adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket . STO
* He could not make out , but he knew that again she was scratching her nose . STO
* Mollie the Mutton was scratching her nose . STO
* The words ran _RARE_ in his head : Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain . STO
* Then the words fell into a pattern : `` Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose , _RARE_ her nose in the rain . STO
* Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain '' . STO
* The pattern would not stop . STO
* It came again and again . STO
* He felt trapped in that pattern , in the repetition . STO
* Suddenly he thought he might weep . STO
* `` What's the matter with me '' ? STO
* He demanded out loud . STO
* He looked wildly around , at the now empty street , at the mud , at the rain . STO
* `` Oh , what's the matter with me '' ? STO
* He demanded . STO
* When he had stored his stock in the great oak chest , locked the two big _RARE_ and secured the additional chain , tied the fly of the tent , and picked up the cash box , he moved up the _RARE_ street . STO
* He would _RARE_ the cash box into the hands of Jed _RARE_ , then stand by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items sold . STO
* Then he -- Then what ? STO
* He did not know . STO
* His mind closed on that prospect , as though fog had descended to _RARE_ out a valley . STO
* Far off , in the dusk , he heard voices singing , muffled but strong . STO
* In one of the huts a group of men were huddled together , singing . STO
* He stopped . STO
* He strained to hear . STO
* He heard the words : `` Rock of Ages , _RARE_ for me , Let me hide myself in _RARE_ ! STO
* Let the water and the blood From _RARE_ _RARE_ side flow ! STO
* '' He thought : I am a Jew from _RARE_ . STO
* He was standing there , he thought , in Virginia , in the _RARE_ dusk , in a _RARE_ greatcoat that had belonged to another Jew . STO
* That other Jew , a young man too , had left that greatcoat behind , in a rich house , and _RARE_ away . STO
* He had crossed the river which now , beyond the woods _RARE_ , was sliding _RARE_ under the mist . STO
* He had plunged into the dark woods beyond . STO
* He had died there . STO
* What had that man , that other young Jew , felt as he stood in the _RARE_ and heard other men , far away , singing together ? STO
* Adam thought of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ after _RARE_ , row after row , the thousands of huts , stretching away into the night . STO
* He thought of the men , the _RARE_ thousands , _RARE_ in them . STO
* He thought of Simms Purdew snoring on his bunk while _RARE_ James crouched by the _RARE_ , _RARE_ an _RARE_ for _RARE_ , and a wet log _RARE_ . STO
* He thought of Simms Purdew , who once had _RARE_ at the edge of a _RARE_ , a _RARE_ scream on his lips , and swung a _RARE_ musket like a _RARE_ to beat down the _RARE_ of Rebel _RARE_ about him . STO
* He thought of Simms Purdew rising up , _RARE_ in glory . STO
* He felt the _RARE_ of pity _RARE_ through him , _RARE_ his very flesh . STO
* Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know . STO
* They did not know who they were or know their own worth . STO
* In the pity for them his _RARE_ was gone . STO
* Then he thought of _RARE_ _RARE_ standing in his rich house saying : `` God is tired of taking the blame . STO
* He is going to let _RARE_ take the blame for a while '' . STO
* He thought of the old man laughing under the _RARE_ of the great _RARE_ . STO
* He thought : Only in my heart can I make the world hang together . STO
* Adam rose from the _RARE_ necessary to enter the hut . STO
* He saw Mose _RARE_ by the _RARE_ , breaking up _RARE_ into a pan . STO
* A pot was boiling on the _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ give _RARE_ _RARE_ all his money '' ? STO
* Mose asked softly . STO
* Adam nodded . STO
* `` Yeah '' , Mose murmured , `` yeah . STO
* And look what he done give us '' . STO
* Adam looked at the pot . STO
* `` What is it '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Mose said , and _RARE_ licked his lips . STO
* `` _RARE_ big fat chicken , yeah '' . STO
* He licked his lips again . STO
* Then : `` yeah . STO
* A chicken with six _RARE_ and a tail _RARE_ a _RARE_ . STO
* And it _RARE_ for _RARE_ '' . STO
* Mose _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ you , _RARE_ ? STO
* It is the same _RARE_ same , tell me its name . STO
* It is _RARE_ with _RARE_ on . STO
* It is salt _RARE_ . STO
* It is salt _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* That _RARE_ , it was so full of _RARE_ it would jump and run and not come when you say , _RARE_ . STO
* Had to put my foot on it to hole it down while I cut it up _RARE_ the _RARE_ '' . STO
* He dumped the pan of _RARE_ _RARE_ into the boiling pot of _RARE_ . STO
* `` Good _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , he mumbled , and stirred the pot . STO
* He stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder . STO
* `` _RARE_ what _RARE_ _RARE_ et tonight '' ? STO
* He demanded . STO
* `` _RARE_ what I had to fix _RARE_ _RARE_ Him '' ? STO
* Adam shook his head . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Mose said . STO
* She was a child too much a part of her environment , too eager to grow and learn and experience . STO
* Once , they were at _RARE_ for the summer ( again , Fritzie said , a good place , even though they were being robbed ) . STO
* One soft evening -- that marvelous _RARE_ time when the _RARE_ _RARE_ warmth _RARE_ and a smell of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ everything -- Amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk . STO
* Fritzie was on the couch reading ; ; Laura was sitting in an easy chair about eight feet away . STO
* The infant , in white _RARE_ _RARE_ , her face intense and _RARE_ , had _RARE_ a few _RARE_ steps toward her father . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ walk -- walk '' , he said . STO
* Then , gently , he shoved her behind toward Laura . STO
* Amy walked -- making it halfway across the cottage floor . STO
* She lost not a second , picking herself up and continuing her _RARE_ to Laura . STO
* Then Laura took her gently and shoved her off again , toward Fritzie : Amy did not laugh -- this was work , concentration , achievement . STO
* In a few minutes she was making the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; soon she was _RARE_ around the house , _RARE_ her new skill . STO
* Some _RARE_ logic , a _RARE_ of optimism as _RARE_ as the scent of _RARE_ _RARE_ that came through the window ( a _RARE_ perhaps _RARE_ by the pill Fritzie had given her ) , _RARE_ her for a moment . STO
* Amy had to be safe , had to come back to them -- if only to _RARE_ that share of _RARE_ experiences that were her due , if only to give her parents another chance to do better by her . STO
* Through the _RARE_ of terror , she _RARE_ _RARE_ sharp point -- Amy would be _RARE_ , a new child , with new parents , living under new circumstances . STO
* The comfort was _RARE_ , yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to _RARE_ without the _RARE_ of illusion . STO
* _RARE_ at her husband's _RARE_ body , his chest rising and falling in _RARE_ _RARE_ , she saw the _RARE_ of his _RARE_ world , that _RARE_ garden from which he _RARE_ flowers and _RARE_ . STO
* She _RARE_ him . STO
* She admired him . STO
* In the darkness , she saw him stirring . STO
* He seemed to be muttering , his voice surprisingly clear . STO
* `` _RARE_ should have let me take that money out '' , Andrus said . STO
* `` _RARE_ minute I'd have been fine . STO
* _RARE_ should have let me do it '' . STO
* Laura touched his hand . STO
* `` Yes , I know , Fritzie . STO
* I should have '' . STO
* Tuesday The heat _RARE_ on Tuesday . STO
* Southern California gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell , _RARE_ , more _RARE_ , more laden with man's _RARE_ impurities than the worst days of the summer past . STO
* It could continue this way , hitting _RARE_ and more in the Valley , Joe McFeeley knew , into October . STO
* He and _RARE_ Moll were _RARE_ coffee at the breakfast bar . STO
* Both had been up since _RARE_ -- _RARE_ on the _RARE_ watch , McFeeley unable to sleep during his _RARE_ relief . STO
* The night before , they had telephoned the Andrus maid , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and she had arrived early , bursting her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused McFeeley and _RARE_ Moll . STO
* The latter , _RARE_ her for the coffee , had winked and muttered , `` Sure _RARE_ , honey '' . STO
* _RARE_ was the wrong woman for these _RARE_ . STO
* With a hard eye , she informed Moll : `` Don't sure _RARE_ me , officer . STO
* I'm honey only to my husband , understand '' ? STO
* Sergeant Moll understood . STO
* The maid was very black and very _RARE_ , _RARE_ in a yellow _RARE_ uniform . STO
* Her speech was barren of _RARE_ ; ; she was one of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ the rolling _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ of Los Angeles . STO
* Not seeing her dark intelligent face , one would have _RARE_ the voice as that of a _RARE_ Village _RARE_ , ten years out of _RARE_ . STO
* After she had served the detectives coffee and toast ( they politely _RARE_ eggs , uncomfortable about their _RARE_ ) , she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock market _RARE_ . STO
* While she was thus engaged , McFeeley questioned her about her whereabouts the previous day , any _RARE_ she had of people hanging around , of _RARE_ delivery boys or _RARE_ , of strange cars _RARE_ the neighborhood . STO
* She answered him precisely , missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , Joe realized , was her own woman . STO
* She was the only kind of Negro Laura Andrus would want around : independent , _RARE_ , probably charging double what ordinary _RARE_ did for _RARE_ -- and _RARE_ efficient . STO
* When the parents emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later , the maid greeted them quietly . STO
* `` I'm awful sorry about what's happened '' , _RARE_ said . STO
* `` Maybe _RARE_ be a _RARE_ day '' . STO
* She charged off to the _RARE_ . STO
* Moll took his coffee into the nursery . STO
* During the night , a phone company _RARE_ had _RARE_ the bells and installed red _RARE_ on the _RARE_ . STO
* Someone would have to remain in the office continually . STO
* McFeeley greeted the parents , then studied his _RARE_ . STO
* He wanted to take the mother to headquarters at once and start her on the _RARE_ file . STO
* `` _RARE_ well '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* Andrus did not answer him . STO
* His face was _RARE_ with _RARE_ , _RARE_ than normal . STO
* The woman had the _RARE_ look of an _RARE_ , as if she had not slept at all . STO
* `` Oh -- we managed '' , she said . STO
* `` I'm a little _RARE_ . STO
* Did anything happen during the night '' ? STO
* `` Few _RARE_ calls '' , McFeeley said . STO
* `` A couple of tips we're running down -- nothing promising . STO
* We can expect more of the same . STO
* Too bad your number is in the _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Didn't occur to me my child would be _RARE_ when I had it listed '' , Andrus muttered . STO
* He settled on the sofa with his coffee , warming his hands on the cup , although the room was heavy with heat . STO
* The three had little to say to each other . STO
* The previous night's horror -- the absolute failure , overcast with the _RARE_ of the press , had left them all with a _RARE_ sense of _RARE_ , of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ their coffee , discussing the weather , the day's shopping , _RARE_ _RARE_ at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news show , even the front page of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Register , resting on the kitchen bar . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; Amy still missing . STO
* Once , Andrus walked by it , hastily scanned the bold black _RARE_ and the _RARE_ lead of the article ( by _RARE_ _RARE_ , staff _RARE_ -- age not given ) , and muttered : `` We a _RARE_ national _RARE_ '' . STO
* McFeeley told the parents he would _RARE_ them to police headquarters in a half hour . STO
* Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors . STO
* He did not want to bring the _RARE_ to the station house too early -- _RARE_ had summoned a press conference , and he didn't want them subjected to the reporters again . STO
* He could think of nothing else to tell them : no _RARE_ , no hopeful _RARE_ at great _RARE_ that day . STO
* When the detective left , Andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to _RARE_ the network to get a substitute director for his current project . STO
* Mrs. Andrus was talking to the maid , arranging for her to come in every day , instead of the four days she now worked . STO
* Outside , only a _RARE_ of reporters remained . STO
* The bulk of the press corps was covering _RARE_ conference . STO
* In contrast to the _RARE_ of the previous night , there were only four cars parked across the street . STO
* Two men he did not recognize were _RARE_ coffee and _RARE_ sweet rolls . STO
* He did not see _RARE_ , or _RARE_ , or _RARE_ , or any of the _RARE_ crew that had so _RARE_ him twelve hours ago . STO
* However , the _RARE_ remained , _RARE_ by several dozen _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The street _RARE_ had not yet been around . STO
* One of the reporters called to him : `` Anything new , Lieutenant '' ? STO
* And he ignored him , _RARE_ the parked cars and walking up the path to the _RARE_ house . STO
* When McFeeley was halfway to the door , the _RARE_ emerged -- a _RARE_ , dark man , his head thick with _RARE_ black hair , his eyes like two of the black _RARE_ he _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* McFeeley identified himself . STO
* The master of the house , his _RARE_ face _RARE_ , _RARE_ to _RARE_ his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective . STO
* Inside , as soon as Mr. _RARE_ had _RARE_ -- in a hoarse whisper -- the _RARE_ errand , his family gathered in a _RARE_ , forming a mass of dark flesh on and around a _RARE_ sofa which stood at one side of a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ by marble _RARE_ and _RARE_ lamps , they seemed to be _RARE_ for a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It was amazing how they had _RARE_ together for protection : an enormous _RARE_ in a _RARE_ silk _RARE_ , rising from the breakfast table ; ; a gross boy in his _RARE_ , _RARE_ in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; ; a girl in her _RARE_ , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; ; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the _RARE_ . STO
* They answered him in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , _RARE_ the word from Papa , who _RARE_ cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white _RARE_ and burst off to the _RARE_ . STO
* No , they hadn't seen anyone around ; ; no , they didn't know the Andrus family ; ; yes , they had read about the case ; ; yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no longer . STO
* They offered no opinions , _RARE_ nothing , betrayed no emotions . STO
* _RARE_ them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple . STO
* The _RARE_ people seemed to him of that _RARE_ of human beings whose _RARE_ _RARE_ them from _RARE_ . STO
* He imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined ( if they were , they were never _RARE_ ) , whose children had no unhappy _RARE_ , whose names never knew scandal . STO
* The equation was simple : _RARE_ brought them happiness , and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had , let no one in on the _RARE_ . STO
* By comparison , Fritzie and Laura Andrus were quivering _RARE_ . STO
* They possessed no outer _RARE_ , no hard shells of confidence ; ; they had enough difficulty getting from day to day , let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them . STO
* _RARE_ expressed no curiosity over the case , offered no expression of sympathy , made no move to _RARE_ _RARE_ to the door . STO
* All four remained _RARE_ on the sofa until he had left . STO
* He had spoken to Mrs. . STO
* _RARE_ the previous day . STO
* There remained a family named Kahler , owners of a two-story _RARE_ house on the south side of the Andrus home . STO
* Their names had not come up in any discussions with Laura , and he had no idea what they would be like . STO
* McFeeley noted the _RARE_ lawn and _RARE_ : each blade of grass _RARE_ , bright and firm ; ; each _RARE_ _RARE_ with good health . STO
* The door was answered by a slender man in his _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , somewhat _RARE_ in manner , wearing _RARE_ glasses . STO
* When Joe identified himself , he nodded , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ him into a _RARE_ living room . STO
* Mrs. Kahler joined them . STO
* She had a _RARE_ quality -- a gray , lean woman , not _RARE_ . STO
* Both were dressed rather formally . STO
* The man wore a _RARE_ and a tie , the woman had on a dark green dress and three _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ thing '' , Mr. Kahler said , when they were seated , `` when I heard you ringing , I figured it was that guy down the block , _RARE_ '' . STO
* McFeeley looked puzzled . STO
* Kahler continued : `` I fixed his dog the other day and I guess he's sore , so I expected him to come _RARE_ in '' . STO
* Mr. Kahler went on to explain how _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ had been `` making '' in his flower beds . STO
* The dog refused to be scared off , so Kahler had purchased some small _RARE_ . STO
* He would lay in wait in the garage , and when the _RARE_ came scratching around , he'd let fly with a _RARE_ bomb . STO
* `` _RARE_ the hell out of him '' , Kahler grinned . STO
* `` I hit him in the _RARE_ once '' . STO
* Both grinned at the detective . STO
* `` Finally , all I needed was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a _RARE_ and that dumb dog would run _RARE_ for his life '' . STO
* In the dim _RARE_ light they dressed and straightened up the room , and then they went across the hall to the kitchen . STO
* She was _RARE_ by the stove . STO
* He found the pilot light and turned on one of the _RARE_ for her . STO
* The gas _RARE_ up two inches high . STO
* They found the _RARE_ . STO
* And put water on to boil and then searched through the _RARE_ . STO
* Several sections of a _RARE_ of dark bread ; ; butter ; ; _RARE_ ; ; a tiny cake of ice . STO
* In their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver , they opened every _RARE_ door in the kitchen and _RARE_ . STO
* While she was settling the _RARE_ , he went back across the hall to their bedroom , opened one of the _RARE_ , and took out powdered coffee and sugar . STO
* She appeared with the _RARE_ and he opened the windows . STO
* `` Do you want to call Eugene '' ? STO
* He didn't , but it was not really a question , and so he left the room , walked down the hall to the front of the apartment , hesitated , and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study . STO
* A sleepy voice answered . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , Harold said , in an _RARE_ that did credit to Miss _RARE_ , his _RARE_ French teacher . STO
* At the same time , his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here , and _RARE_ an appeal to whatever is reasonable , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ in everybody . STO
* Since ordinary _RARE_ conversation was impossible , it was at least something that they were able to offer Eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it , and the plate of bread and butter , and that Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first . STO
* Eugene put a _RARE_ of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water . STO
* _RARE_ , he said : `` I am sorry that my work _RARE_ me from doing anything with you today '' . STO
* They assured him that they did not expect or need to be _RARE_ . STO
* Harold put a _RARE_ of powdered coffee in his cup and filled it with hot water , and then , stirring , he sat back in his chair . STO
* The chair creaked . STO
* Every time he moved or said something , the chair creaked again . STO
* Eugene was not entirely silent , or openly _RARE_ -- unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the _RARE_ that creaked so _RARE_ was an act of _RARE_ . STO
* It went right on _RARE_ under his own considerable weight , and all it needed , Harold thought , was for somebody to _RARE_ himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it . STO
* Through the open window they heard sounds below in the street : _RARE_ , a tired _RARE_ _RARE_ step , voices . STO
* Harold indicated the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in . STO
* Eugene told him and he promptly forgot . STO
* They passed the _RARE_ , the bread , the _RARE_ butter , back and forth . STO
* Nothing was said about hotels or train _RARE_ . STO
* Eugene offered Harold his car , to use at any time he cared to , and when this offer was not accepted , the _RARE_ creaked . STO
* They all three had another cup of coffee . STO
* Eugene was in his _RARE_ and dressing gown , and on his large feet he wore yellow _RARE_ slippers that turned up at the toes . STO
* `` _RARE_ me '' , he said in _RARE_ English , and got up and left them , to _RARE_ and dress . STO
* The first shrill ring of the telephone brought Harold out into the hall . STO
* He realized that he had no idea where the telephone was . STO
* At that moment the bathroom door flew open and Eugene came out , with his face _RARE_ for shaving , and strode down the hall , _RARE_ the _RARE_ of his dressing gown as he went . STO
* The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall . STO
* Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub . STO
* Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them . STO
* Harold shook his head . STO
* `` _RARE_ called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said . STO
* `` She wants you and _RARE_ to have dinner with her tomorrow night '' . STO
* He handed Harold a key to the front door , and _RARE_ him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment . STO
* When enough time had _RARE_ so that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten , Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another . STO
* In the room next to theirs was a huge _RARE_ , of _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ with gold _RARE_ . STO
* It was the most _RARE_ _RARE_ he had ever seen . STO
* Then came their bathroom , and then a bedroom that , _RARE_ by the photographs on the walls , must belong to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A young woman who looked like _RARE_ , with her two children . STO
* _RARE_ and Eugene on their wedding day . STO
* _RARE_ photographs in _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and an elderly man who must be _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , considerably younger and very different . STO
* The _RARE_ . STO
* And a _RARE_ man whose glance -- direct , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ accusing -- was _RARE_ by the _RARE_ and black frame . STO
* It was the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person . STO
* Professor _RARE_ , could it be ? STO
* With the metal _RARE_ closed , the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there . STO
* One of the _RARE_ _RARE_ was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and _RARE_ , which seemed to be _RARE_ in brown or _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The curtains were of the same material , and there were some big oil paintings -- _RARE_ in the style of _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Though , taken individually , the big rooms were , or seemed to be , square , the apartment as a whole formed a _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ , the study where Eugene slept , was light and bright and _RARE_ and cheerful . STO
* The window looked out on the Place _RARE_ -- it was the only window of the apartment that did . STO
* _RARE_ around slowly , he saw a marble _RARE_ , a desk , a low _RARE_ of _RARE_ with _RARE_ brass wire instead of glass _RARE_ in the doors . STO
* The _RARE_ Eugene had slept in , made up now with its _RARE_ _RARE_ cover and _RARE_ . STO
* The portable record player with a pile of classical records beside it . STO
* _RARE_ Fifth was the one on top . STO
* _RARE_ Music could not be _RARE_ passion . STO
* Besides , the records were dusty . STO
* He tried the doors of the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ he could read easily through the _RARE_ wires : works on _RARE_ , _RARE_ physics , history , _RARE_ , political science . STO
* No poetry . STO
* No novels . STO
* He moved over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything . STO
* The clock on the _RARE_ piece was _RARE_ and _RARE_ so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room . STO
* The _RARE_ called out to them as they were passing through the _RARE_ . STO
* Her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building , and her small front room was _RARE_ with heavy furniture -- a big , round , oak dining table and chairs , a _RARE_ , with a row of _RARE_ letters inserted between the mirror and its frame . STO
* The _RARE_ had come while they were out , and had been put in their room , the _RARE_ said . STO
* He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said : `` Now what do we do '' ? STO
* `` Call the _RARE_ , I guess '' . STO
* `` I guess '' . STO
* Rather than sit around waiting for the _RARE_ to be delivered , they had gone _RARE_ . STO
* They went to the _RARE_ _RARE_ , expecting to find the _RARE_ of Europe , and found instead a _RARE_ of that long double row of _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ clothing and _RARE_ of every sort , as far as the eye could see . STO
* They looked , even so . STO
* _RARE_ at everything . STO
* _RARE_ bought some cotton _RARE_ , and Harold bought _RARE_ . STO
* They had lunch at a sidewalk cafe _RARE_ the intersection of two broad , busy , _RARE_ streets , and coming home they got lost in the _RARE_ ; ; it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed , in order to take the line that went to the Place _RARE_ . STO
* It was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted it into the _RARE_ . STO
* When he opened the door , there stood Eugene , on his way out of the apartment . STO
* He was wearing _RARE_ and shorts and an _RARE_ shirt , and in his hand he carried a little black bag . STO
* He did not explain where he was going , and they did not ask . STO
* Instead , they went on down the hall to their room . STO
* `` Do you think he could be having an affair '' ? STO
* _RARE_ asked , as they heard the front door close . STO
* `` Oh no '' , Harold said , shocked . STO
* `` Well , this is France , after all '' . STO
* `` I know , but there must be some other explanation . STO
* He's probably spending the evening with friends '' . STO
* `` And for that he needs a little bag '' ? STO
* They went shopping in the neighborhood , and bought two _RARE_ of bread with the _RARE_ _RARE_ they had been given in _RARE_ , and some cheese , and a dozen eggs , and a bag of _RARE_ from a _RARE_ in the Place _RARE_ -- the first _RARE_ they had seen since they landed . STO
* They had _RARE_ , sitting in front of a cafe . STO
* When they got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment , and thought how , under different circumstances , they might have stayed on here , in these _RARE_ , _RARE_ rooms that reminded him of the _RARE_ apartment in the East _RARE_ . STO
* They could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days . STO
* He went down the hall to _RARE_ bathroom , to turn on the _RARE_ heater , and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming _RARE_ . STO
* He felt them . STO
* They were damp . STO
* He reached out and felt the bath _RARE_ hanging on the _RARE_ rack over the tub . STO
* _RARE_ also . STO
* He looked around the room and then called out : `` Come here , quick '' ? STO
* `` What is it '' ? STO
* _RARE_ asked , standing in the doorway . STO
* `` I've solved the mystery of the little bag . STO
* There it is and there is what was in it . STO
* But where do people go swimming in Paris ? STO
* That boat in the river , maybe '' . STO
* `` What boat '' ? STO
* `` There's a big boat anchored near the Place De La _RARE_ , with a swimming pool in it -- didn't you notice it ? STO
* But if he has time to go swimming , he had time to be with us '' . STO
* She looked at him in surprise . STO
* `` I know '' , he said , reading her mind . STO
* `` I don't know what I'm going to do with you '' . STO
* `` It's because we are in France '' , he said , `` and know so few people . STO
* So something like this matters more than it would at home . STO
* Also , he was so nice when he was nice '' . STO
* `` All because I didn't feel like dancing '' . STO
* `` I don't think it was that , really '' . STO
* `` Then what was it '' ? STO
* `` I don't know . STO
* I wish I did . STO
* The _RARE_ coat , maybe . STO
* The thing about Eugene is that he's very proud '' . STO
* And the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be . STO
* For instance -- what about all those people Harold _RARE_ went toward _RARE_ , as if this were the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of knowing each other ? STO
* Fortunately , the _RARE_ questions raised by objects do not need to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields . STO
* And in any case , answers may _RARE_ but they do not change anything . STO
* He brought with him a mixture of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , of about a hundred _RARE_ weight . STO
* They took _RARE_ body , then , and wrapped it in _RARE_ with the _RARE_ ; ; that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial . STO
* _RARE_ as present at the _RARE_ were Mary , Mary's sister , Mary _RARE_ , John , Joseph of _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ as he might , he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus . STO
* _RARE_ the scene was crowded with _RARE_ , such as the dramatic _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ , where the _RARE_ _RARE_ had _RARE_ Mary's last _RARE_ moment . STO
* In his concept there could be no one else present . STO
* His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe . STO
* When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap ? STO
* Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of _RARE_ was at _RARE_ _RARE_ asking for Christ's body , _RARE_ was gathering his mixture of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and the others had gone home to _RARE_ . STO
* Those who saw his finished _RARE_ would take the place of the _RARE_ witnesses . STO
* They would feel what Mary was undergoing . STO
* There would be no _RARE_ , no angels . STO
* These would be two human beings , whom God had chosen . STO
* He felt close to Mary , having spent so long _RARE_ on the beginning of her journey . STO
* Now she was intensely alive , _RARE_ ; ; her son was dead . STO
* Even though he would later be _RARE_ , he was at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross . STO
* In his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother ; ; only what Mary felt for her son . STO
* _RARE_ inert body would be passive , his eyes closed . STO
* Mary would have to carry the human communication . STO
* This seemed right to him . STO
* It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems . STO
* Since his Christ was to be life size , how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming _RARE_ ? STO
* His Mary would be slender of _RARE_ and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this _RARE_ man as _RARE_ and _RARE_ as she would a child . STO
* There was only one way to accomplish this : by design , by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he _RARE_ the _RARE_ corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept . STO
* He started by making free sketches to _RARE_ up his thinking so that images would appear on paper . STO
* _RARE_ , these _RARE_ what he was feeling within himself . STO
* At the same time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping at the _RARE_ , _RARE_ up fresh impressions of what they looked like , how they moved . STO
* In particular he sought the gentle , _RARE_ _RARE_ , with head _RARE_ and _RARE_ coming to the middle of their _RARE_ , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper . STO
* _RARE_ that _RARE_ could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ as he went along , _RARE_ a _RARE_ clay figure , then bought yards of an _RARE_ material from a _RARE_ , wet the _RARE_ cloth in a _RARE_ and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the _RARE_ , to the consistency of thick mud . STO
* No fold could be _RARE_ , each turn of the _RARE_ had to serve _RARE_ , to cover the _RARE_ slender legs and feet so that they would give _RARE_ support to Christ's body , to _RARE_ her inner turmoil . STO
* When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made . STO
* `` So that's sculpture '' , commented Argiento _RARE_ , when he had _RARE_ down the floor for a week , `` making mud _RARE_ '' . STO
* Michelangelo grinned . STO
* `` See , Argiento , if you control the way these _RARE_ are _RARE_ , like this , or made to flow , you can _RARE_ the body attitudes . STO
* They can have as much _RARE_ appeal as flesh and bone '' . STO
* He went into the Jewish quarter , wanting to draw _RARE_ faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked . STO
* The Jewish section was in _RARE_ , near the _RARE_ at the church of San _RARE_ a _RARE_ . STO
* The colony had been small until the Spanish _RARE_ of _RARE_ drove many Jews into Rome . STO
* Here , for the most part , they were well treated , as a `` _RARE_ of the Old _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' ; ; many of their _RARE_ members were prominent in the _RARE_ as _RARE_ , musicians , _RARE_ . STO
* The men did not object to his _RARE_ them while they went about their work , but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to _RARE_ . STO
* He was told to ask for _RARE_ _RARE_ at the _RARE_ on Saturday afternoon . STO
* Michelangelo found the _RARE_ in the room of study , a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous _RARE_ eyes , _RARE_ in black _RARE_ with a _RARE_ on his head . STO
* He was reading from the _RARE_ with a group of men from his _RARE_ . STO
* When Michelangelo explained why he had come , _RARE_ _RARE_ replied _RARE_ : `` The Bible _RARE_ us to bow down to or to make _RARE_ images . STO
* That is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture '' . STO
* `` But , _RARE_ _RARE_ , you don't object to others creating works of art '' ? STO
* `` Not at all . STO
* Each religion has its own _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I am _RARE_ a _RARE_ from white _RARE_ marble . STO
* I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew . STO
* I cannot accomplish this if you will not help me '' . STO
* The _RARE_ said thoughtfully , `` I would not want my people to get in trouble with the Church '' . STO
* `` I am working for the _RARE_ of San _RARE_ . STO
* I'm sure he would _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` What kind of models would you prefer '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* In their _RARE_ . STO
* Not bulky _RARE_ , but _RARE_ men . STO
* With intelligence . STO
* And sensitivity '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ smiled at him with _RARE_ old but _RARE_ eyes . STO
* `` Leave me your address . STO
* I will send you the best the quarter has to offer '' . STO
* Michelangelo hurried to _RARE_ solitary _RARE_ room with his sketches , asked the _RARE_ to design a stand which would _RARE_ the seated _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ studied the drawings and _RARE_ a _RARE_ couch . STO
* Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber . STO
* _RARE_ he and Argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets . STO
* His first model arrived at dusk . STO
* He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to _RARE_ , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of _RARE_ to _RARE_ around his _RARE_ , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes . STO
* He then draped him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother's lap . STO
* The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; ; only the instructions from his _RARE_ kept him from _RARE_ . STO
* But at the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother _RARE_ in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was after , and promised to speak to his friends . STO
* He worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the _RARE_ . STO
* Mary presented quite a different problem . STO
* Though this sculpture must take place _RARE_ years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive of her as a woman in her _RARE_ , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry . STO
* His image of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman , even as had his memory of his mother . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ introduced him into several Roman homes . STO
* Here he _RARE_ , sitting in their flowing _RARE_ of _RARE_ and silk , young girls not yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year or two . STO
* Since the _RARE_ _RARE_ hospital had taken only men , he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy ; ; but he had _RARE_ the women of _RARE_ in their fields and homes . STO
* He was able to _RARE_ the body lines of the Roman women under their _RARE_ . STO
* He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together : a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He drew toward the composite design from his _RARE_ accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches . STO
* Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay . STO
* Here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to _RARE_ forms . STO
* When he wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity , he added or _RARE_ clay . STO
* Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in _RARE_ quality and _RARE_ . STO
* He respected each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character : his _RARE_ drawings had a _RARE_ , suggesting skin texture ; ; the clay he used _RARE_ to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an _RARE_ , in a _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull . STO
* Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; ; they remained rough starting points . STO
* When _RARE_ he was charged with spontaneous energy ; ; too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere _RARE_ of his model . STO
* The true _RARE_ had to be inside the marble itself . STO
* _RARE_ and models were his thinking . STO
* _RARE_ was action . STO
* 10 . STO
* The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice . STO
* Argiento had been trained so _RARE_ by the _RARE_ that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the _RARE_ _RARE_ with river sand after each meal . STO
* `` Argiento , this is _RARE_ '' , he complained , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather . STO
* `` You're too clean . STO
* _RARE_ the studio once a week . STO
* That's enough '' . STO
* `` No '' , said Argiento _RARE_ . STO
* `` Every day . STO
* Before dawn . STO
* I was taught '' . STO
* `` And God help anyone who _RARE_ to _RARE_ you '' ! STO
* _RARE_ Michelangelo ; ; yet he knew that he had nothing to _RARE_ about , for Argiento made few demands on him . STO
* The boy was becoming acquainted with the _RARE_ families that brought produce into Rome . STO
* On _RARE_ he would walk miles into the _RARE_ to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses . STO
* The one thing he missed from his farm in the _RARE_ Valley was the animals ; ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by _RARE_ : `` Today I go see the horses '' . STO
* It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him . STO
* He was crouched over his _RARE_ in the _RARE_ getting his _RARE_ into _RARE_ , when a _RARE_ of steel flew into his eye and _RARE_ itself in his pupil . STO
* He stumbled into the house , eyes burning like fire . STO
* Argiento made him lie down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , _RARE_ some clean white _RARE_ cloth and applied it to _RARE_ the _RARE_ . STO
* Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned . STO
* He assumed he could _RARE_ the _RARE_ out . STO
* But it would not come . STO
* Argiento never left his side , keeping the water _RARE_ , applying hot _RARE_ throughout the night . STO
* By the second day Michelangelo began to worry ; ; and by the second night he was in a state of panic : he could see nothing out of the _RARE_ eye . STO
* At dawn Argiento went to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ arrived with his family surgeon , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The surgeon carried a _RARE_ of live _RARE_ . STO
* He told Argiento to take a bird out of the _RARE_ , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood _RARE_ into _RARE_ injured eye . STO
* The surgeon came back at dusk , cut the vein of a second _RARE_ , again washed out the eye . STO
* _RARE_ was very still and her breath came in small _RARE_ gasps . STO
* The thin legs _RARE_ _RARE_ once , then Kate felt the little body _RARE_ in her arms and heard one _RARE_ sound . STO
* The _RARE_ flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands . STO
* The child was gone . STO
* When Juanita awoke , Kate was still _RARE_ the dead child , still _RARE_ in _RARE_ , `` No , no , oh , no ! STO
* '' They put Kate to bed and wired _RARE_ and sent for the young _RARE_ minister . STO
* He sat beside _RARE_ bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him . STO
* When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words _RARE_ . STO
* Few of the neighbors came , but Mrs. _RARE_ came , called by _RARE_ . STO
* `` It always comes in _RARE_ '' , she sighed heavily . STO
* `` _RARE_ never comes but in _RARE_ '' . STO
* They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and _RARE_ the little box in the quiet family plot . STO
* Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of _RARE_ . STO
* She would not accept the death of such a little child . STO
* `` God called her to Him '' , the minister had said . STO
* God would not do that , Kate thought _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ letter came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself . STO
* In blind panic of grief she accepted _RARE_ _RARE_ , and believed in her _RARE_ that she had been cursed by God . STO
* She held _RARE_ letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed . STO
* She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son . STO
* Joel came and sat _RARE_ with her , sharing her pain and _RARE_ , _RARE_ his eyes from the ice _RARE_ on her bosom . STO
* Juanita and Mrs. _RARE_ kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried . STO
* When she returned to life in the big house she felt _RARE_ of all emotion save _RARE_ to duty . STO
* She _RARE_ herself daily to do what must be done . STO
* She had even _RARE_ herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the _RARE_ room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate _RARE_ of the baby's death . STO
* Juanita _RARE_ about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to `` Miss Juanita _RARE_ '' , bearing a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Seeing the _RARE_ hand , Kate knew _RARE_ that it was from the _RARE_ colonel . STO
* The Federal forces had taken _RARE_ and _RARE_ from the _RARE_ and were moving to take all the mountains . STO
* Kate tried to contain her curiosity and _RARE_ at what the letter _RARE_ , at what _RARE_ existed for Juanita . STO
* Uncle Randolph and Joel had _RARE_ the bottom lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including _RARE_ , had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp . STO
* Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school . STO
* He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from _RARE_ Ferry . STO
* Kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss . STO
* She loved him and missed his company . STO
* Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own . STO
* What it was Kate could not _RARE_ . STO
* He claimed to be visiting the _RARE_ saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his _RARE_ , but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs. _RARE_ funeral . STO
* Joel knew what he was about , however . STO
* `` You're gonna get caught '' , she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the _RARE_ one morning . STO
* `` Not this old _RARE_ '' , chuckled Uncle Randolph . STO
* `` Everybody knows I'm just a _RARE_ , _RARE_ old man who takes to drink . STO
* I aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ still , my foot '' , said Joel . STO
* `` You're back there riding with the guerrillas , the _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , said Uncle Randolph , smiling , `` or I'll give you another black eye '' . STO
* He patted the eye Joel had had _RARE_ in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back . STO
* Kate had no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the _RARE_ at night , had heard _RARE_ on the River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn . STO
* _RARE_ , Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a _RARE_ _RARE_ to his saddle , _RARE_ singing `` Old Dan _RARE_ '' at the top of his voice . STO
* _RARE_ his voice ring _RARE_ up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch _RARE_ as he walked into the house , cold sober . STO
* What he was about became clear to her with the _RARE_ of another _RARE_ proclamation by General _RARE_ , threatening _RARE_ against Rebel guerrillas . STO
* She was taken up in worry for the _RARE_ old man . STO
* Kate drew more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work . STO
* She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss _RARE_ crack Joel across the face with a _RARE_ for letting a snake loose in the _RARE_ . STO
* Kate had walked past the school on her morning _RARE_ and had seen the whole incident , had seen _RARE_ burning _RARE_ before Miss _RARE_ cold , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He had the hardest _RARE_ of growing before him now , as he approached twelve . STO
* These would be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately . STO
* She tried to find some way to draw him out , to help him . STO
* Whenever she found time , she went _RARE_ picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths _RARE_ , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day . STO
* He tended the new _RARE_ _RARE_ had _RARE_ . STO
* He helped Kate and Juanita _RARE_ the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still _RARE_ watching the last fat bees working against the _RARE_ _RARE_ dusk . STO
* No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph . STO
* They stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the _RARE_ , bringing the news . STO
* _RARE_ wrote grimly of the destruction of _RARE_ Ferry before they abandoned it ; ; of their first engagement at _RARE_ _RARE_ after Old Jack's First _RARE_ had destroyed all the rolling stock of the B & O _RARE_ . STO
* The men were _RARE_ , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished . STO
* The _RARE_ came _RARE_ his _RARE_ and told them of the _RARE_ in _RARE_ , Which had formed a new state government by _RARE_ the government at _RARE_ in the east _RARE_ because they were _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ his _RARE_ _RARE_ before them , he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains , at _RARE_ and _RARE_ mountains both , and the Federal _RARE_ on _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ all them _RARE_ _RARE_ the hills , they did ! STO
* They won't never _RARE_ over _RARE_ loyal western Virginia , them _RARE_ ! STO
* The _RARE_ is making everybody take the _RARE_ of _RARE_ around these parts too '' , he _RARE_ . STO
* After he had gone , Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly , `` Would you take their _RARE_ '' ? STO
* And the old man had given a _RARE_ and wicked laugh and said , `` Hell , yes ! STO
* I think I've taken it about fifty times already '' ! STO
* _RARE_ at _RARE_ look of shock . STO
* Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of _RARE_ baby and at _RARE_ decision to go with the South `` And , dear Kate '' , she wrote , `` poor Dr. _RARE_ son Robert is now _RARE_ a _RARE_ company to go South , to his good father's sorrow . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ of Fort _RARE_ is home and _RARE_ volunteers for the U.S. Army . STO
* In spite of the fact that the state _RARE_ voted us neutral , John _RARE_ Morgan is openly flying the _RARE_ flag over his _RARE_ factory '' ! STO
* _RARE_ of a big battle spread like a _RARE_ up the valley . STO
* _RARE_ were _RARE_ at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to _RARE_ for the news . STO
* `` All _RARE_ know down _RARE_ is it were at _RARE_ _RARE_ and it were a big fight '' , the old man told them . STO
* In the next few days they had cause to _RARE_ . STO
* It had been a big battle , and the _RARE_ forces had won . STO
* _RARE_ and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing . STO
* Kate and Mrs. _RARE_ waited for letters anxiously . STO
* Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the _RARE_ . STO
* They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had _RARE_ her land _RARE_ . STO
* The week after _RARE_ the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an _RARE_ rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window . STO
* They had already lost most of their corn , she thought . STO
* _RARE_ they to be _RARE_ again because of the _RARE_ great victory ? STO
* She remembered _RARE_ last proclamation as she hurried _RARE_ down the stairs . STO
* At the landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door . STO
* Juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth . STO
* As Kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel _RARE_ framed in the doorway , his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore . STO
* Kate greeted him _RARE_ , uneasy with _RARE_ at his visit . STO
* `` What brings you here again , Colonel _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She asked , taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the _RARE_ were closed against the afternoon sun . STO
* `` I stopped to say _RARE_ , Mrs. _RARE_ , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby . STO
* I wish our doctor could have saved her '' . STO
* `` It was a terrible loss to me '' , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at _RARE_ . STO
* `` Where will you go now that you're leaving _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She asked him , seeing _RARE_ eyes grow bleak . STO
* `` As you know , General _RARE_ has been _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He has _RARE_ me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the _RARE_ . STO
* I am to go to Washington to serve with him '' . STO
* `` When are you to leave '' ? STO
* Kate asked , watching them both now anxiously . STO
* Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly . STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* Would you permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell , Mrs. _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ here in the parlor where it's cool '' , she said , trying to be calm . STO
* It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs. _RARE_ not to see them . STO
* Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations . STO
* Then she took _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ young _RARE_ where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden . STO
* When _RARE_ called to his _RARE_ and the pair rode off down the River Road where the _RARE_ burned blue , Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry . STO
* She sought Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling . STO
* `` He wants me to go with him tomorrow '' , she told Kate . STO
* `` What do you want to do '' ? STO
* Kate asked , uneasy at the _RARE_ of the girl's dilemma . STO
* `` I could go with him . STO
* He knows me as your _RARE_ , which , of course , I am . STO
* But I am a slave ! STO
* You own me . STO
* It's your decision '' , said Juanita , holding her face very still , trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she _RARE_ her words too distinctly . STO
* `` No , the decision is yours . STO
* I have held your papers of _RARE_ since I married Mr. _RARE_ '' . STO
* The red glow from the _RARE_ had died out of the sky . STO
* The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more . STO
* The things left _RARE_ they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ put out the remaining _RARE_ with a long _RARE_ , and in the smell of scented _RARE_ , the comforting awareness of each other's bodies , the retained pattern of _RARE_ and guests remembered , their minds grew _RARE_ and then empty of images . STO
* They slept -- _RARE_ with a _RARE_ high-pitched snoring , the damn _RARE_ ivory teeth watching him from a _RARE_ table . STO
* In the _RARE_ below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows . STO
* It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of _RARE_ black and the stars _RARE_ the _RARE_ sky . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , old , slow , careful of foot , came down the great staircase , dressed in her best _RARE_ black silk , her _RARE_ shoe _RARE_ held forward . STO
* `` Well , I'm here at last '' , she said , _RARE_ the old _RARE_ on the walls . STO
* `` I don't hear the music . STO
* I am getting _RARE_ , I must admit it '' . STO
* She came to the _RARE_ and stood on the two _RARE_ steps that led down to it . STO
* `` Where is everyone ? STO
* I say , where is everyone ? STO
* Peter , you _RARE_ , you've forgot to order the musicians '' . STO
* She stood there , a large old woman , smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son . STO
* There were times now , like this , when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations . STO
* Was it a birthday ball ? STO
* When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen ? STO
* Or was it her own first ball as _RARE_ of this big house , a Van _RARE_ bride from way _RARE_ near Albany , from _RARE_ . STO
* And this handsome _RARE_ , staring and _RARE_ , was he her _RARE_ ? STO
* _RARE_ picked up the _RARE_ of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a _RARE_ _RARE_ around the _RARE_ . STO
* David _RARE_ was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh . STO
* He had _RARE_ hard from Boston , and he was not used to _RARE_ . STO
* Now , driving the horse and _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ , he felt as if every bone was _RARE_ by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to _RARE_ into _RARE_ and leave his big body helpless and unable to move . STO
* The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the _RARE_ landscape was like a setting for _RARE_ and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the _RARE_ wheels hit a _RARE_ and came out with a _RARE_ and went on . STO
* He would cross to Manhattan , to Harlem _RARE_ , before morning . STO
* There a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of _RARE_ . STO
* He would send on by trusted _RARE_ the _RARE_ with their _RARE_ news . STO
* And he would sleep , sleep , and never think of roads and _RARE_ sore _RARE_ , of colonial wars . STO
* Strange how everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long . STO
* _RARE_ , Sir _RARE_ , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right _RARE_ along to the bay past fish _RARE_ and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of _RARE_ road . STO
* A mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a _RARE_ and _RARE_ grace . STO
* _RARE_ there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads . STO
* David reached for the pair of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ at his feet . STO
* He pulled out one of them and cocked it . STO
* A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of _RARE_ bushes . STO
* It was a _RARE_ hen , five or six feet tall . STO
* It had the features of a man _RARE_ by _RARE_ of loose feathers . STO
* It ran , this _RARE_ beast , on two thin legs , and its wings -- were they _RARE_ arms ? STO
* -- _RARE_ as it ran . STO
* Its _RARE_ was bloody . STO
* Black strips of skin hung from it . STO
* The horse _RARE_ at the _RARE_ thing and _RARE_ its _RARE_ . STO
* David took a firm hand with it . STO
* The creature in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes , _RARE_ with an insane fear . STO
* The _RARE_ bird thing ran away , and to David its _RARE_ sounded like the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Then it was gone . STO
* He drove on , _RARE_ and shaken . STO
* The Sons were out tonight . STO
* Chapter 10 New York lay _RARE_ in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long _RARE_ _RARE_ of Manhattan Island . STO
* It was _RARE_ settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into _RARE_ streets , mostly around the _RARE_ , going _RARE_ north to _RARE_ Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem _RARE_ . STO
* From there it looked across at _RARE_ County and the Hudson River where the _RARE_ houses , _RARE_ , and big farms of the original ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ began . STO
* On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island _RARE_ . STO
* On the western tip of Long Island _RARE_ Brooklyn _RARE_ . STO
* It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor . STO
* A _RARE_ of housing and _RARE_ _RARE_ the top of the heights , and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ was bounded by _RARE_ fences , and there were _RARE_ cattle . STO
* On the _RARE_ north and south , the _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- _RARE_ -- lived along the _RARE_ Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island . STO
* The morning hawk , hungry for any _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ item , kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the _RARE_ in the bay , _RARE_ by the Jersey _RARE_ . STO
* They often threw _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The larger ships were near _RARE_ _RARE_ , already being called , by a few , Jersey City . STO
* These were the ships of His _RARE_ Navy , _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the East _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* The news of battle on _RARE_ Hill had already _RARE_ through , and New York itself was now left in the hands of the local _RARE_ Congress . STO
* The fish hawk , his wings not moving , circled and _RARE_ lower . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ becoming clearer to him , the sides of the wooden sea walls _RARE_ painted yellow and black , the _RARE_ _RARE_ at the _RARE_ . STO
* The captain's _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ was being _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* On shore `` the freed slaves to _RARE_ '' -- the town _RARE_ -- watched the ships and waited . STO
* The _RARE_ de _RARE_ , those sharp _RARE_ and barriers around the _RARE_ at the _RARE_ , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in _RARE_ _RARE_ as the _RARE_ came in . STO
* _RARE_ the bay the _RARE_ were heavy in green timber ; ; their rock _RARE_ led down to the Hudson . STO
* Below in the open bay facing Manhattan was _RARE_ Island , _RARE_ with _RARE_ shells and mud _RARE_ behind which _RARE_ farms , cattle _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ County , past the white church at _RARE_ , past _RARE_ Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white _RARE_ roads of the Long Island _RARE_ there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something _RARE_ to happen . STO
* Today , tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight . STO
* The British ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London . STO
* _RARE_ for more ships , more _RARE_ _RARE_ , and asked what was to be done with a war of _RARE_ ? STO
* David _RARE_ , having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He looked out through _RARE_ turned a faint _RARE_ by sun and weather , looked out at _RARE_ Bridge toward _RARE_ . STO
* The road seemed _RARE_ with a few more wagons than usual ; ; a carriage raising up the choking June dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local _RARE_ company _RARE_ with _RARE_ , _RARE_ rifles , every kind of horse pistol , old _RARE_ , or _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ events of the last few days _RARE_ _RARE_ mind and he rubbed his _RARE_ chin and felt again the _RARE_ in his _RARE_ caused by his saddle _RARE_ from Boston . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ , he _RARE_ . STO
* He had sent the _RARE_ downtown to the proper people and had slept . STO
* Now there was more to do . STO
* _RARE_ not written down had to be _RARE_ to the local provincial government . STO
* He scratched his _RARE_ neck . STO
* From the _RARE_ , hung on a _RARE_ chair , David took out a good English razor , a present from John _RARE_ . STO
* He found _RARE_ water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he _RARE_ his face and stood _RARE_ the razor on his broad leather belt , its _RARE_ held firm by a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* He hoped he was free of _RARE_ . STO
* Here he was , suddenly caught up in the _RARE_ of a war , in the spite and _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war . STO
* David _RARE_ had certain _RARE_ _RARE_ that this _RARE_ was not wholly what it appeared on the surface . STO
* He knew that many were using it for their own ends . STO
* But it did not matter . STO
* He _RARE_ the razor slowly ; ; what _RARE_ was that a new concept of Americans was being born . STO
* That some men did not want it he could understand . STO
* The moral _RARE_ of _RARE_ made them loyal usually to their _RARE_ . STO
* Yet some , like _RARE_ _RARE_ , would _RARE_ themselves for the new ideas . STO
* _RARE_ circumstances would test us all , he decided . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ would occur . STO
* No doubt John _RARE_ would do well now ; ; war was a _RARE_ heaven . STO
* And what of that poor _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ he had seen on the road driving down from _RARE_ ? STO
* _RARE_ like that would increase rather than be done away with . STO
* One had to believe in final events or one was _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of nothing . STO
* He saw with John _RARE_ now that the _RARE_ of man was a dream . STO
* Life was a short play of _RARE_ shadows . STO
* David began to _RARE_ with great _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Time plays an essential part in our _RARE_ , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine ( or admit ) the image of _RARE_ laughing filled his mind -- so desirable , so _RARE_ , so full of _RARE_ of pleasure and joy . STO
* He drove _RARE_ patterns off , carefully shaving his long upper lip . STO
* It is harder , he muttered , to _RARE_ on man ( or woman ) than on God . STO
* David finished shaving , washed his face clean of _RARE_ , and _RARE_ and _RARE_ his hair . STO
* He was proud that he had never worn a _RARE_ . STO
* More and more of the _RARE_ were wearing their own hair and not using powder . STO
* He felt cheerful again , _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ in his _RARE_ brown suit , the _RARE_ riding boots . STO
* It is so easy to _RARE_ sentiment . STO
* In the meadow below , _RARE_ officers shouted at their men and on _RARE_ Bridge two boys sat fishing . STO
* The future would happen ; ; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much . STO
* A man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days . STO
* He began to pack the _RARE_ . STO
* And all this too shall pass away : it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy -- yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the _RARE_ Hudson Valley , where a feeling of _RARE_ was normal in those _RARE_ _RARE_ with their _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ men and wrinkled women in _RARE_ black _RARE_ carried on in a primitive way , almost _RARE_ from _RARE_ times . STO
* _RARE_ puzzled Andrei . STO
* He wondered how they could go on in poverty , _RARE_ , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives _RARE_ . STO
* Andrei remembered a _RARE_ meeting long ago . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ had returned from the _RARE_ in Palestine and , before the national leadership , _RARE_ the _RARE_ of drying up _RARE_ and _RARE_ the desert . STO
* A _RARE_ drive to buy _RARE_ and machinery was launched . STO
* Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference . STO
* Had he found the meaning too late ? STO
* It _RARE_ him . STO
* The land of the Lublin _RARE_ was rich , but no one seemed to care . STO
* In the _RARE_ land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the _RARE_ . STO
* He had sat beside Alexander _RARE_ at the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* All of them were there in this loosely _RARE_ association of _RARE_ _RARE_ , and each _RARE_ the other and beat his breast for his own approaches . STO
* When Alexander _RARE_ rose to speak , the hall became silent . STO
* `` I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of _RARE_ . STO
* We are here because all our _RARE_ travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity . STO
* Beyond the forest all our _RARE_ merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren , _RARE_ hills of _RARE_ . STO
* This is our singular goal . STO
* How we travel through the forest is for each man's conscience . STO
* Where we end our journey is always the same . STO
* We all seek the same thing through different ways -- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and _RARE_ _RARE_ which will continue to _RARE_ us until the _RARE_ of David _RARE_ over Zion '' . STO
* This was how Alexander _RARE_ expressed pure _RARE_ . STO
* It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it . STO
* In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine . STO
* He _RARE_ the idea of drying up _RARE_ or the _RARE_ of _RARE_ or of leaving his natural _RARE_ . STO
* Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex , `` I only want to be a _RARE_ . STO
* Warsaw is my city , not _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief . STO
* Warsaw ! STO
* He saw the _RARE_ eyes of the Home Army chief , Roman , and all the _RARE_ and the faces of the _RARE_ who held only hatred for him . STO
* They had let this black hole of death in _RARE_ heart exist without a cry of protest . STO
* Once there had been big _RARE_ rooms where _RARE_ bowed and kissed the ladies' hands as they _RARE_ from behind their fans . STO
* Warsaw ! STO
* Warsaw ! STO
* `` Miss _RARE_ . STO
* I am a Jew '' . STO
* Day by day , week by week , month by month , the _RARE_ _RARE_ at _RARE_ heart . STO
* He ground his teeth together . STO
* I hate Warsaw , he said to himself . STO
* I hate Poland and all the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of them . STO
* All of Poland is a coffin . STO
* The terrible vision of the ghetto streets _RARE_ his mind . STO
* What matters now ? STO
* What is beyond this fog ? STO
* Only Palestine , and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe . STO
* By late afternoon the train _RARE_ into the _RARE_ yards in the _RARE_ at Lublin , which was filled with lines of cars poised to _RARE_ the tools of war to the Russian front . STO
* At a _RARE_ , another train which was a familiar sight these days . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Jews . STO
* _RARE_ skilled eye _RARE_ them up . STO
* They were not _RARE_ . STO
* He guessed by their appearance that they were _RARE_ . STO
* He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka . STO
* Of all the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most . STO
* The _RARE_ were all gone . STO
* Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto . STO
* From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point . STO
* He and _RARE_ watched it carefully . STO
* Lublin generally was the _RARE_ of what would happen elsewhere . STO
* Early in _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , established _RARE_ headquarters for all of Poland . STO
* The _RARE_ ran a check on _RARE_ and had only to conclude that he was in a _RARE_ of war with Hans Frank and the civilian _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ built the _RARE_ Corps . STO
* Lublin was the seed of action for the `` final solution '' of the Jewish problem . STO
* As the _RARE_ from _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ came in through _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , work camps , concentration camps _RARE_ in the area . STO

* Lublin was their heart . STO
* In the spring of 1942 _RARE_ _RARE_ began in Lublin . STO
* The ghetto , a _RARE_ of _RARE_ , was _RARE_ into the camp in the _RARE_ _RARE_ called Majdanek . STO
* As the camp _RARE_ , it was _RARE_ by a _RARE_ of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by _RARE_ from outside Poland . STO
* In and in and in they poured through the _RARE_ of Majdanek , but they never left , and Majdanek was not growing any larger . STO
* What was happening in Majdanek ? STO
* Was _RARE_ _RARE_ the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the _RARE_ in Warsaw ? STO
* Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected ? STO
* Andrei stopped at _RARE_ Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings . STO
* His watch told him he was still early . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ he could see a portion of the ghetto wall . STO
* He found an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him . STO
* _RARE_ Boulevard was filled with black _RARE_ uniforms and the dirty _RARE_ ones of their _RARE_ . STO
* `` Captain _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the _RARE_ , homely face of Sergeant Styka . STO
* Styka sat beside him and _RARE_ his hand excitedly . STO
* `` I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn . STO
* I thought you might get in on a morning train '' . STO
* `` It's good to see you again , Styka '' . STO
* Styka studied his captain . STO
* He almost broke into tears . STO
* To him , Andrei _RARE_ had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer . STO
* His captain was thin and _RARE_ and his beautiful boots were worn and _RARE_ . STO
* `` Remember to call me _RARE_ '' , Andrei said . STO
* Styka nodded and _RARE_ and blew his nose _RARE_ . STO
* `` When that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war '' . STO
* `` I'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin '' . STO
* Styka _RARE_ about fate . STO
* `` For a time I thought of trying to reach the _RARE_ Polish Forces , but one thing led to another . STO
* I got a girl in trouble and we had to get married . STO
* Not a bad girl . STO
* So we have three children and responsibilities . STO
* I work at the _RARE_ . STO
* Nothing like the old days in the army , but I get by . STO
* Who _RARE_ ? STO
* Many times I tried to reach you , but I never knew how . STO
* I came to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall '' `` I understand '' . STO
* Styka blew his nose again . STO
* `` _RARE_ you able to make the arrangements '' ? STO
* Andrei asked . STO
* `` There is a man named Grabski who is the _RARE_ in charge of the _RARE_ at Majdanek . STO
* I did exactly as instructed . STO
* I told him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government in _RARE_ in London '' . STO
* `` His answer '' ? STO
* `` Ten thousand _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Can he be trusted '' ? STO
* `` He is aware he will not live for _RARE_ hours if he _RARE_ you '' . STO
* `` Good man , Styka '' . STO
* `` Captain _RARE_ must you go inside Majdanek ? STO
* The stories Everyone really knows what is happening there '' . STO
* `` Not everyone , Styka '' . STO
* `` What good will it really do '' ? STO
* `` I don't know . STO
* Perhaps perhaps there is a _RARE_ of conscience left in the human race . STO
* Perhaps if they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation '' . STO
* `` Do you really believe that , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` I have to believe it '' . STO
* Styka shook his head slowly . STO
* `` I am only a simple soldier . STO
* I cannot think things out too well . STO
* Until I was transferred into the _RARE_ _RARE_ I was like every other _RARE_ in my feeling about Jews . STO
* I hated you when I first came in . STO
* But my captain might have been a Jew , but he wasn't a Jew . STO
* What I mean is , he was a _RARE_ and the greatest soldier in the _RARE_ . STO
* Hell , sir . STO
* The men of our company had a dozen _RARE_ defending your name . STO
* You never knew about it , but by God , we taught them respect for Captain _RARE_ '' . STO
* Andrei smiled . STO
* `` Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think , Holy Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds of years . STO
* Why '' ? STO
* `` How can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see '' ? STO
* `` But we are neither blind nor insane . STO
* The men of your company would not allow your name _RARE_ . STO
* Why do we let the Germans do this '' ? STO
* `` I have sat many hours with this , Styka . STO
* All I ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country . STO
* I've lost faith , Styka . STO
* I used to love this country and believe that someday we'd win our battle for _RARE_ . STO
* But now I think I hate it very much '' . STO
* `` And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do '' ? STO
* The question frightened Andrei . STO
* `` Please don't go inside Majdanek '' . STO
* `` I'm still a soldier in a very small way , Styka '' . STO
* It was an answer that Styka understood . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ was beyond the bridge over the River _RARE_ near the rail center . STO
* Grabski sat in a _RARE_ _RARE_ , cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown . STO
* He was a square brick of a man with a _RARE_ face and _RARE_ Polish features . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ around the bowl of _RARE_ in which he _RARE_ thick black bread . STO
* Half of it dripped down his chin . STO
* He washed it down with beer and produced a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` Well '' ? STO
* Andrei demanded . STO
* Grabski looked at the pair of them . STO
* He grunted a sort of `` yes '' answer . STO
* `` My cousin works at the Labor Bureau . STO
* He can make you work papers . STO
* It will take a few days . STO
* I will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew . STO
* I don't know if I can get you into the inner camp . STO
* Maybe yes , maybe no , but you can observe everything from the roof of a _RARE_ we are building '' . STO
* Grabski _RARE_ his way to the bottom of the _RARE_ bowl . STO
* `` Can't understand why the hell anyone wants to go inside that _RARE_ place '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ from the Home Army '' . STO
* `` Why ? STO
* Nothing there but Jews '' . STO
* Andrei shrugged . STO
* `` We get strange orders '' . STO
* `` Well -- what about the money '' ? STO
* Andrei _RARE_ off five _RARE_ notes . STO
* Grabski had never seen so much money . STO
* His broad flat fingers , _RARE_ into massive _RARE_ by years of _RARE_ , snatched the bills _RARE_ . STO
* `` This ain't enough '' . STO
* `` You get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek '' . STO
* `` I ain't taking no _RARE_ chances for no Jew business '' . STO
* Andrei and Styka were silent . STO
* She was getting real dramatic . STO
* I'd have been more impressed if I hadn't remembered that she'd played _RARE_ _RARE_ in her _RARE_ _RARE_ course . STO
* I didn't want her back on that broken record . STO
* `` _RARE_ free in the whole _RARE_ world '' , was all I could think of to say . STO
* When I'd delivered myself of that _RARE_ there was nothing to do but order up another drink . STO
* `` I am '' , she said . STO
* I'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky _RARE_ and how it was _RARE_ fifty dollars I was spending . STO
* It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to _RARE_ her neck because she was so _RARE_ but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch . STO
* _RARE_ or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me . STO
* I was crazy about her all over again . STO
* It was the call of the wild all right . STO
* That evening turned out to be hell like all the others . STO
* We moved down Broadway from _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* It was the same old routine . STO
* Eileen got to dancing , just a little tiny dancing step to a _RARE_ tune that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick up strange men , but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd pull herself together and talk so _RARE_ in that sweet _RARE_ voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together and there I was back on the _RARE_ . STO
* I did have the decency to call up Thelma and tell her I'd met old friends and would be home late . STO
* `` I could scratch her eyes out '' , Eileen cried and _RARE_ her foot when I came back from the phone _RARE_ . STO
* `` You know I don't like my men to have other women . STO
* I hate it . STO
* I hate it '' . STO
* She got so drunk I had to take her home . STO
* It was a walk up on Hudson Street . STO
* She just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and wouldn't let me go . STO
* There was a man's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table . STO
* The place _RARE_ of some kind of hair lotion these _RARE_ characters use . STO
* `` What about _RARE_ '' ? STO
* I had to shake her to make her listen . STO
* `` Precious . STO
* What about him '' ? STO
* Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic . STO
* `` Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom . STO
* We are above being _RARE_ . STO
* He's used to me bringing home strange men . STO
* I'll just tell him you're my husband . STO
* He can't object to that '' . STO
* `` Well I object . STO
* If he _RARE_ his nose in here I'll _RARE_ him '' . STO
* `` That really would be funny '' . STO
* She began to laugh . STO
* She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed . STO
* After all I'm made of flesh and blood . STO
* I'm not a plaster saint . STO
* _RARE_ up was horrible . STO
* Never in my life have I felt so _RARE_ about anything I've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife . STO
* We both had _RARE_ . STO
* Eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the pillow . STO
* She lay under the covers making _RARE_ motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the _RARE_ . STO
* I was stumbling in my _RARE_ trying to find my way around her damn _RARE_ when I _RARE_ that _RARE_ sweet _RARE_ smell . STO
* There was somebody else in the apartment . STO
* I stiffened . STO
* _RARE_ I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a _RARE_ that is going to get into a fight . STO
* I turned around with the _RARE_ in my hand . STO
* My eyes were so _RARE_ I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth _RARE_ guy in a new spring overcoat and a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Brown eyes , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ face without an expression in the world . STO
* We didn't have time to speak before _RARE_ voice was screeching at us from the bed . STO
* `` Joseph _RARE_ _RARE_ meet _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ meet _RARE_ '' . STO
* She gave the _RARE_ laugh I ever heard . STO
* `` And don't either of you forget that I'm not any man's property . STO
* If you want to fight , go down on the sidewalk '' . STO
* She was enjoying the situation . STO
* Imagine that . STO
* Eileen was a _RARE_ all right . STO
* Instead of wanting to _RARE_ the poor bastard I found myself having a _RARE_ for him . STO
* Maybe he felt the same way . STO
* I never felt such a _RARE_ _RARE_ in my life . STO
* First thing I knew he was in the _RARE_ cooking up the breakfast and I was _RARE_ Eileen her _RARE_ and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her _RARE_ . STO
* I couldn't face Thelma after that night . STO
* I didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone . STO
* I wrote her that I'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express . STO
* Of course I had to give her _RARE_ address , but she never came near us . STO
* All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was _RARE_ forever . STO
* She never said a word about the fifty dollars . STO
* She added a _RARE_ begging me to be careful about drinking . STO
* I must know that that was my greatest weakness _RARE_ three times . STO
* _RARE_ I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away . STO
* That finished me with Thelma . STO
* _RARE_ Eileen to _RARE_ all the drama out of a situation . STO
* And there I was _RARE_ up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street . STO
* I use the phrase _RARE_ because there was something positively _RARE_ about our relationship . STO
* I felt it and it ate on me all the time , but I didn't know how right I was till later . STO
* What I did know was that Precious was always around . STO
* He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs . STO
* `` Who do you think _RARE_ the rent ? STO
* You wouldn't have me throw the poor boy out on the street '' , Eileen said when I _RARE_ her about it . STO
* I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention . STO
* Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she didn't want to hear . STO
* Still I didn't think she was _RARE_ me with Precious right then . STO
* To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night . STO
* Precious had me worried . STO
* I couldn't make out what his _RARE_ was . STO
* I'd thought him a _RARE_ or _RARE_ but he didn't seem to be . STO
* He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his _RARE_ manner . STO
* Still he let Eileen treat him like a _RARE_ . STO
* Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work . STO
* I never could find out what his business was . STO
* He always seemed to have money in his pocket . STO
* The phone had been _RARE_ but _RARE_ came for him and notes by special _RARE_ . STO
* Now and then he would disappear for several days . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions . STO
* `` Oh he's just an international _RARE_ '' , Eileen would shout with her _RARE_ laugh . STO
* Poor devil he can't have been too happy either . STO
* He got no relief from drink because , though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening , he'd leave it on the table _RARE_ . STO
* When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess . STO
* Occasionally if I pushed him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel _RARE_ _RARE_ would show through that smooth face of his . STO
* `` Some day '' , I told Eileen , `` that guy will kill us both '' . STO
* She just wouldn't listen . STO
* _RARE_ drunk every night was the only way I could handle the situation . STO
* Eileen seemed to feel the same way . STO
* We still had that much in common . STO
* The trouble was drinking cost money . STO
* The way Eileen and I were hitting it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening . STO
* Eileen must have _RARE_ a little out of Precious . STO
* I raised some _RARE_ by _RARE_ the good clothes I had left over from my respectable _RARE_ life , but when that was gone I didn't have a cent . STO
* I don't know what we would have done if Pat _RARE_ hadn't come to town . STO
* Pat _RARE_ looked like a heavier Jim . STO
* He had the same bullet head of _RARE_ _RARE_ hair but he didn't have _RARE_ _RARE_ humor or his brains or his charm . STO
* He was a big thick _RARE_ violent man . STO
* Now Pat may have been a _RARE_ and a _RARE_ , but he was a good _RARE_ Catholic and he loved his little sister . STO
* Those _RARE_ had that _RARE_ _RARE_ that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything . STO
* Pat took Eileen and me out to dinner at a _RARE_ steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again . STO
* `` _RARE_ God _RARE_ joined '' _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ were real religious people except for Kate . STO
* Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of _RARE_ . STO
* Pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost her job on that fashion magazine . STO
* It had gone big with the Hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of Art And _RARE_ . STO
* How about me trying to help her get her job back ? STO
* All evening Eileen had been as _RARE_ as a little girl getting ready for her first _RARE_ . STO
* It just about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with . STO
* `` But brother I can't take a job right now '' , she said with her eyes on her ice cream , `` I'm going to have a baby , _RARE_ _RARE_ baby , my own husband's baby '' . STO
* My first thought was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd been living together six weeks . STO
* Pat meanwhile was _RARE_ over with sentiment . STO
* _RARE_ thing that ever happened . STO
* Now Eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and _RARE_ , and she'd have to quit drinking . STO
* He'd come East for the _RARE_ , by God he would . STO
* When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into _RARE_ hand to help towards a _RARE_ . STO
* Before he left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job . STO
* Pat had contacts all over the labor movement . STO
* A friend of _RARE_ named Frank _RARE_ had just _RARE_ into the _RARE_ Union . STO
* The _RARE_ were retired _RARE_ and small time _RARE_ off _RARE_ and _RARE_ who acted as _RARE_ on the _RARE_ . STO
* Most of them were elderly men . STO
* It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the _RARE_ is awful in the _RARE_ of New York . STO
* They weren't as well paid as they should have been . STO
* One reason the _RARE_ let _RARE_ take them over was to get the protection of his _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ needed a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the _RARE_ local . STO
* There I was a retired _RARE_ and structural iron worker who'd never _RARE_ a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement . STO
* For once _RARE_ was a recommendation . STO
* _RARE_ couldn't wait to get me hired . STO
* With my gray hair and my _RARE_ countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff . STO
* The things a man will do for a woman . STO
* There was one fact which Rector could not _RARE_ , one truth which he could not deny . STO
* As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave . STO
* No matter how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never _RARE_ that one _RARE_ of pride that gave him definition as an individual . STO
* All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord's servants . STO
* It was only natural that Fletcher would _RARE_ for a position in which he could make the decisions . STO
* Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more _RARE_ office in the _RARE_ of the church -- his _RARE_ for the _RARE_ had died very early in his career -- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel . STO
* He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were _RARE_ and could not be separated . STO
* He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi _RARE_ , the _RARE_ in the village _RARE_ out , the mission standing _RARE_ , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be _RARE_ , too . STO
* But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan , that man's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , _RARE_ force for good in the world . STO
* He sighed . STO
* How foolish it was to try to _RARE_ the truth in an area where only faith would _RARE_ . STO
* He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed . STO
* His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days . STO
* His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had _RARE_ _RARE_ or whether Hino was simply _RARE_ against the _RARE_ work in the print shop , using the _RARE_ in his arm as an excuse . STO
* In any event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked , telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning . STO
* Hino was _RARE_ at the prospect . STO
* He was allowed to spend his nights at an _RARE_ near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the _RARE_ parlor -- an excellent place to make contact with the enemy . STO
* He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , _RARE_ _RARE_ as Rector gave him his final instructions . STO
* He was to get involved in no arguments ; ; he was to try to make no _RARE_ ; ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard . STO
* It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , _RARE_ _RARE_ , openly _RARE_ , would make a poor _RARE_ agent . STO
* If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it _RARE_ , but in this _RARE_ manner he would probably receive more _RARE_ answers than if he tried to get them by _RARE_ . STO
* In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino . STO
* From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job , any job -- his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand -- he had been ready to become a Christian . STO
* He had already been studying the Bible ; ; he knew the _RARE_ , and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector , announced that he wanted to be _RARE_ and that was that . STO
* Rector had never been able to find out much about _RARE_ past . STO
* Hino talked very little about himself except for the _RARE_ times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject . STO
* _RARE_ the pieces of this _RARE_ together , Rector had the vague _RARE_ of a _RARE_ . STO
* Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in _RARE_ , and divided his life between the land and the sea , _RARE_ the marginal _RARE_ on his small _RARE_ farm with _RARE_ employment on a fishing boat . STO
* Without exception _RARE_ brothers turned to either one or both of their father's _RARE_ , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired _RARE_ and proved immensely popular as a _RARE_ . STO
* He had gone into the Japanese _RARE_ , had been trained as an officer , had _RARE_ in one or two _RARE_ -- he never went into detail regarding his military experience -- and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out of the blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian . STO
* Rector was often curious ; ; often _RARE_ to ask questions but he never did . STO
* If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so _RARE_ . STO
* Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information , ready to _RARE_ it with his customary _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ with his active _RARE_ . STO
* When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some _RARE_ of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few _RARE_ in the village and the phone in _RARE_ office rarely rang unless it was important . STO
* He was surprised to find _RARE_ secretary on the other end of the line . STO
* He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted . STO
* The _RARE_ was _RARE_ a group of _RARE_ , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for the most part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission . STO
* They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it . STO
* `` Oh '' ? STO
* Rector said . STO
* `` I guess it will be all right . STO
* When would the _RARE_ like to bring his guests up here '' ? STO
* `` This afternoon '' , the secretary said . STO
* `` At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time '' . STO
* `` All right '' , Rector said . STO
* `` I will be expecting them '' . STO
* He was about to hang up the phone , but a note of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ voice left the conversation open . STO
* He had something more to say . STO
* `` I beg to _RARE_ if the back is now safe for _RARE_ '' , he said . STO
* Rector laughed despite himself . STO
* `` Unless the _RARE_ has been working on it '' , he said , then checked himself and added : `` You can tell _RARE_ that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* The secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in _RARE_ hand . STO
* Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission . STO
* For the _RARE_ to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter . STO
* Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily _RARE_ by the people in the village . STO
* At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity . STO
* No , Kayabashi was bringing his _RARE_ here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to _RARE_ it until they arrived . STO
* When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. _RARE_ to prepare tea and _RARE_ for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been _RARE_ to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . STO
* _RARE_ had a pile of _RARE_ near one side of the lawn . STO
* Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; ; he wanted the mission compound to be _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A good initial impression would be important now . STO
* He went into the print shop , where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press . STO
* `` How many _RARE_ do we have in stock '' ? STO
* Rector said . STO
* `` I should say about a hundred thousand '' , Fletcher said . STO
* `` Why '' ? STO
* `` I would like to enact a little _RARE_ this afternoon '' , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission . STO
* He did not wish to _RARE_ Kayabashi exactly , just to display the mission activities in a _RARE_ and impressive manner . STO
* Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would _RARE_ the things Rector requested . STO
* _RARE_ next stop was at the _RARE_ , where _RARE_ was _RARE_ a test . STO
* He _RARE_ to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside . STO
* He told her of the visitors and then of his plans . STO
* `` How many children do you have present today '' ? STO
* He said . STO
* She looked back toward the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Fifteen '' , she said . STO
* `` No , only fourteen . STO
* The little _RARE_ girl had had to go home . STO
* She has a pretty bad cold '' . STO
* `` I would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , _RARE_ , full of life . STO
* I want to create the impression of a compound full of children . STO
* Do you think you can manage it '' ? STO
* _RARE_ smiled . STO
* `` I'll try '' . STO
* As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall , Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him . STO
* The _RARE_ in the coffee house had done little to _RARE_ his spirits , but he was still a little _RARE_ around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident . STO
* `` I think I've fixed the _RARE_ so we won't have to worry about it for a long time '' , he said . STO
* `` I've adjusted the gauge so that the _RARE_ cuts out before the water gets too low . STO
* '' `` Fine '' , Rector said . STO
* He looked out over the _RARE_ of the compound . STO
* It was going to take a lot of activity to fill it . STO
* `` Have you ever operated a transit '' ? STO
* He said . STO
* `` No , sir '' , Johnson said . STO
* `` You are about to become a _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , Rector said . STO
* `` When _RARE_ gets back with the _RARE_ , I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys . STO
* _RARE_ can help you . STO
* You'll find an old transit in the basement . STO
* The glass is out of it , but that won't matter . STO
* It looks pretty efficient and that's the important thing '' . STO
* He went on to explain what he had in mind . STO
* Johnson nodded . STO
* He said he could do it . STO
* Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall . STO
* It was rather a childish game , all in all , but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much . STO
* He was not sure what effect it would have , but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it . STO
* He was not going to lose the mission by _RARE_ , and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little _RARE_ group to the mission , he was going to be in for a surprise . STO
* He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall , and then to take charge of the office while the party was here . STO
* When everything had been done , Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock . STO
* At two thirty he sent _RARE_ to the top of the wall at the _RARE_ corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first _RARE_ the approach of _RARE_ party . STO
* Then Rector , _RARE_ in his best blue _RARE_ suit , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting . STO
* The air was cooler here , and the _RARE_ pattern of the trees threw a _RARE_ shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant . STO
* She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be _RARE_ . STO
* The fish took the _RARE_ . STO
* He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of _RARE_ , he would be at home at the hour mentioned . STO
* But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new _RARE_ . STO
* She was told by the _RARE_ who opened the door that his _RARE_ was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed . STO
* Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the _RARE_ _RARE_ her purpose . STO
* She wrote again and now , _RARE_ for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career . STO
* She could act and she could write . STO
* His _RARE_ was concerned in the management of _RARE_ _RARE_ but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and _RARE_ her novel ? STO
* At last he _RARE_ to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal : Have you any objection to the following plan ? STO
* On Thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles . STO
* There we shall be free and unknown ; ; we can return the following morning She concluded by asking for a brief interview -- `` to settle with you where '' -- and she threw in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' . STO
* She opened his reply with trembling fingers he agreed ! STO
* And he would see her that evening . STO
* _RARE_ at last ! STO
* At their meeting he told her not to bother about `` where '' -- he would attend to that . STO
* There was one of the new _RARE_ in the room and , as Claire rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song before she left . STO
* She _RARE_ him _RARE_ charming _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' , which was the _RARE_ of the moment . STO
* She had never sung better . STO
* `` Your voice is _RARE_ '' , he approved with a warm smile . STO
* `` _RARE_ will be a new experience -- I have never before made love to a _RARE_ . STO
* There have been _RARE_ _RARE_ , chattering _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , a proud _RARE_ , a silly _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ -- whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my _RARE_ '' . STO
* And so they went , he choosing of all places an _RARE_ near _RARE_ _RARE_ , scene a generation ago of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Club . STO
* He _RARE_ Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the _RARE_ _RARE_ , which he had had at _RARE_ from old _RARE_ _RARE_ , one of the leaders of the so-called `` Order '' . STO
* Each wore the _RARE_ _RARE_ at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ girls danced in the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a _RARE_ filled with _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ up pictures of the _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , all that belonged to the age of `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the Order ! STO
* The casual _RARE_ of a _RARE_ _RARE_ seemed _RARE_ by comparison . STO
* They passed close by the turn to _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their _RARE_ _RARE_ , the air about them scented with stock , and listening to the _RARE_ who had _RARE_ in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden . STO
* _RARE_ and peaceful -- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure ? STO
* _RARE_ with the _RARE_ Byron ! STO
* How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers . STO
* How was she to behave , Claire wondered . STO
* To be passive , to be _RARE_ shy was _RARE_ absurd . STO
* She was the _RARE_ as clearly as was Venus in _RARE_ poem . STO
* And while her _RARE_ did not suffer from _RARE_ , _RARE_ might well be an equal _RARE_ . STO
* No , she would not pretend _RARE_ , but neither must she be _RARE_ bold . STO
* _RARE_ -- that was the thing . STO
* In the bedroom she would insist on darkness . STO
* With his club foot he might well be grateful . STO
* At the _RARE_ , which was situated close to a broad _RARE_ , Byron was greeted by the landlord with _RARE_ _RARE_ and addressed as `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* The place was evidently a familiar _RARE_ and Claire wondered what other _RARE_ loves had been _RARE_ in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown . STO
* The fire in the sitting room was lighted . STO
* `` What about the bedroom '' ? STO
* Byron inquired . STO
* `` Seems to me last time I was here the _RARE_ bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell '' . STO
* `` We found some _RARE_ had built a nest in the chimney , _RARE_ , but I promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again '' . STO
* So , not only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again . STO
* Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , _RARE_ of a trivial _RARE_ in the _RARE_ history of _RARE_ Juan . STO
* A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of _RARE_ . STO
* When _RARE_ ship had borne him to _RARE_ , French _RARE_ had started to cross the _RARE_ , the first shipments in a dozen _RARE_ years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural _RARE_ where the sweet _RARE_ of the Spanish _RARE_ still ruled . STO
* As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron _RARE_ as much for his own entertainment as hers . STO
* `` _RARE_ is _RARE_ '' , he said . STO
* `` The great Greek _RARE_ are concerned with man against _RARE_ , not man against man for the _RARE_ of a woman's body . STO
* So don't see yourself as a _RARE_ or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance '' . STO
* `` The gods seemed to think sex pretty important '' , she _RARE_ . STO
* `` Mars and Venus , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , Jupiter and _RARE_ , Byron and the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ nest . STO
* That would be _RARE_ , I suppose . STO
* Wasn't the _RARE_ her symbol '' ? STO
* Byron laughed . STO
* `` So you know something of the _RARE_ , do you '' ? STO
* `` Tell me about _RARE_ , how she behaved , what she did to please you '' . STO
* `` I'll tell you nothing . STO
* I don't ask you who _RARE_ you're being _RARE_ to , husband or lover . STO
* _RARE_ , I don't care '' . STO
* For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who _RARE_ away from _RARE_ , who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind . STO
* `` Very well '' , she said , `` I'll not _RARE_ you . STO
* What matter the others so long as I have my place in history '' . STO
* She was striking the right note . STO
* No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favored , _RARE_ could hardly seem _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ lover -- if ever the world was any man's _RARE_ it was his . STO
* The light supper over , Claire went to him and , _RARE_ an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee . STO
* He drew her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his . STO
* Her lips , moist and parted , spoke his name . STO
* `` Byron '' ! STO
* His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the _RARE_ _RARE_ that _RARE_ the striped _RARE_ gown ; ; then , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with _RARE_ fingers , _RARE_ it . STO
* The _RARE_ beneath was _RARE_ and , _RARE_ his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to _RARE_ it , _RARE_ as if she were a child . STO
* But , _RARE_ by his kiss , his _RARE_ hand , her desire was _RARE_ . STO
* She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom . STO
* Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame _RARE_ the rich color . STO
* He drank slowly with due appreciation . STO
* It was an excellent _RARE_ . STO
* He rose and went to the bedroom . STO
* _RARE_ in the doorway he said : `` The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most challenging _RARE_ in all nature '' . STO
* When Claire returned to _RARE_ she longed to tell them she had become _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* By odd coincidence , on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read _RARE_ , which was the latest of the _RARE_ _RARE_ successes . STO
* As he _RARE_ the _RARE_ measures , it was as much as Claire could do to _RARE_ herself from bursting out with her dramatic _RARE_ . STO
* `` Although it is not the best of which he is capable '' , said Shelley as he closed the book , `` it is still poetry of a high order '' . STO
* `` If he would only leave the East '' , said Mary . STO
* `` I am tired of _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` The hero of his next poem is _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , said Claire , with slightly _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` How do you know that '' ? STO
* _RARE_ Mary . STO
* `` I was told it on good authority '' , Claire answered _RARE_ . STO
* `` I mustn't tell , I mustn't tell '' , she repeated to herself . STO
* `` I promised him I wouldn't '' . STO
* Chapter 9 winter came , and with it Mary's baby -- a boy as she had wished . STO
* William , he was called , in honor of the man who was at once _RARE_ _RARE_ and his most bitter _RARE_ . STO
* With a _RARE_ irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly _RARE_ his daughter : `` _RARE_ and Mrs. _RARE_ will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable _RARE_ , and that her child is well '' . STO
* At the same time another child -- this one of _RARE_ brain -- was given to the world : _RARE_ , a poem of _RARE_ beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ was published only to be _RARE_ attacked , _RARE_ ignored . STO
* Shelley sent a copy to _RARE_ , a former friend , and another to _RARE_ . STO
* Neither acknowledged the gift . STO
* Only Mary's _RARE_ sustained him in his disappointment . STO
* She understood completely . STO
* Not a thought nor a _RARE_ was missed in her summary of appreciation . STO
* `` You have made the labor worth while '' , he said to her , smiling . STO
* `` And in the future , since I write for a public of one , I can save the poor _RARE_ from _RARE_ their money '' . STO
* `` A public of one '' , Mary echoed _RARE_ . STO
* `` How can you say such a thing ? STO
* There will be thousands who will _RARE_ to the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* There are some even now . STO
* What about that dear , _RARE_ Mr. _RARE_ ? STO
* I am sure he is in _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Poor Mr. _RARE_ , he always has to be _RARE_ out for my _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` There are other Mr. _RARE_ . STO
* Not everyone is _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* Mary's _RARE_ attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral _RARE_ . STO
* She was _RARE_ of his easy success as compared with _RARE_ failure . STO
* The same month that _RARE_ was published , _RARE_ sold twenty thousand copies of The _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , a _RARE_ bit of _RARE_ that even _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ at . STO
* The _RARE_ poet was at _RARE_ mark . STO
* The _RARE_ writing was in keeping with his mood of savage _RARE_ . STO
* On all sides doors were being slammed in his face . STO
* The previous _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ as they were , had only served to increase his _RARE_ . STO
* Now , under the impact of his wife's _RARE_ , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to _RARE_ , however brilliant , however _RARE_ the _RARE_ might be . STO
* He tried _RARE_ and openly _RARE_ his devotion to his half sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin . STO
* For the moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity . STO
* But the _RARE_ successfully started in the last days of autumn was now _RARE_ . STO
* Byron , since the separation from his wife had been living in a _RARE_ house in _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional _RARE_ , claiming that his every move was watched by _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ handed the pass to the colonel . STO
* He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the _RARE_ belt . STO
* Despite his _RARE_ , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines . STO
* He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task . STO
* -- _RARE_ . STO
* -- Sir ? STO
* -- _RARE_ me the copies of everything B and C companies have _RARE_ in the last six months . STO
* -- The last six months , sir ? STO
* -- You heard me . STO
* There's a lot of waste going on here . STO
* It's got to stop . STO
* I want to take a look . STO
* This is no damned holiday , _RARE_ . STO
* Get busy . STO
* -- Yes , sir . STO
* _RARE_ left the tent . STO
* Below he could see the bright _RARE_ lighting the _RARE_ . STO
* He glanced back . STO
* The colonel crouched _RARE_ on one of the _RARE_ chairs , methodically tearing at his _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ was a _RARE_ structure of heavy _RARE_ covered with earth . STO
* It stood some fifty _RARE_ from the edge of the bank . STO
* From the outside , it seemed no more than a low _RARE_ , a lump on the dark earth . STO
* A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor . STO
* Two _RARE_ enabled observers to watch across the river . STO
* The place smelled strongly of rank , _RARE_ earth , _RARE_ wood and _RARE_ . STO
* The plank floor was _RARE_ beneath _RARE_ boots . STO
* At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle . STO
* There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window _RARE_ and back , _RARE_ slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams . STO
* In the corner was the soldier with the white flag . STO
* He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth . STO
* Watson hardly looked at him . STO
* The man had come _RARE_ aboard the _RARE_ _RARE_ at the last instant , _RARE_ the flag of _RARE_ . STO
* Someone had _RARE_ him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed . STO
* An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank . STO
* The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy . STO
* When the boat had touched , the _RARE_ ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers . STO
* Watson had presented his _RARE_ and been led to the _RARE_ . STO
* The officer had told him that both lists must be checked . STO
* Watson had given his name and asked for a _RARE_ pass . STO
* The officer , surprised , said he would have to see . STO
* Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later . STO
* He had peered through the darkness at the _RARE_ . STO
* The men he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them . STO
* He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt . STO
* He had hoped to be alone in the _RARE_ , but the soldier had followed him . STO
* Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence . STO
* Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not _RARE_ his form . STO
* Watson glanced briefly at him , seeing only a body _RARE_ erect behind the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* -- We won't be too long . STO
* If my pass is approved , I may be a half hour . STO
* The soldier answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving . STO
* Watson turned away and did not see the man's knees _RARE_ and his body _RARE_ . STO
* -- Yes , sir . STO
* He had acknowledged the man . STO
* It was easier to think now , Watson decided . STO
* The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts . STO
* He paced slowly , _RARE_ , staring at the damp , _RARE_ floor . STO
* He tried to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some _RARE_ _RARE_ of the dead boy . STO
* But he groped _RARE_ . STO
* His lack of success steadily _RARE_ his interest . STO
* He stopped _RARE_ , leaned against the _RARE_ , _RARE_ wall and let his mind drift . STO
* A feeling of _RARE_ , an _RARE_ of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known , _RARE_ through him . STO
* What in the name of God was he doing , crouched in a _RARE_ pit on the wrong bank of the river ? STO
* Why had he crossed the dark water , to bring back a group of _RARE_ soldiers or to _RARE_ in a _RARE_ hole ? STO
* He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion . STO
* He was conscious of a growing sense of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ had written it all out , hadn't he ? STO
* Wasn't the report official enough ? STO
* What did he hope to accomplish here ? STO
* _RARE_ had ordered him not to leave the far bank . STO
* _RARE_ by a guilty urge , he had _RARE_ the order of a man he respected . STO
* For what ? STO
* To tell John something he would find out for himself . STO
* The figure in the corner _RARE_ loudly , a deep , liquid _RARE_ . STO
* Watson _RARE_ and then laughed aloud . STO
* _RARE_ ! STO
* The _RARE_ voice was muffled again , _RARE_ with _RARE_ . STO
* He clutched the staff , and his dark eyes blinked _RARE_ . STO
* -- _RARE_ me , sir . STO
* -- Let's get out of here . STO
* Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river _RARE_ . STO
* To his left , the two _RARE_ _RARE_ their sharp _RARE_ into the soft bank . STO
* The _RARE_ boat swung slowly to the pull of the current . STO
* A soldier held the end of a _RARE_ rope . STO
* Three Union guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready . STO
* Watson stared at them curiously . STO
* They were _RARE_ men , well fed and _RARE_ , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots . STO
* Behind them _RARE_ a long column of weak , _RARE_ men . STO
* The thin gray figures raised a hoarse , _RARE_ cry like the call of a bird _RARE_ . STO
* They moved toward the _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and shoving . STO
* Four men were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise . STO
* They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats . STO
* The Union soldiers _RARE_ arms and settled into healthy , indifferent _RARE_ to watch the feeble _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* The crawling men tried to rise and fell again . STO
* No one moved to them . STO
* Watson watched two of them _RARE_ into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg _RARE_ . STO
* In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and _RARE_ arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff . STO
* The third crawling man forced himself erect . STO
* He swayed like a _RARE_ , his arms milling in slow circles . STO
* He paced forward _RARE_ , leaning too far back , his head tilted oddly . STO
* His steps were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown back , his progress was a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He appeared to be peering _RARE_ down his nose at the crowded and _RARE_ vessel that would carry him to freedom . STO
* He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , his weight nearly _RARE_ the craft . STO
* Watson looked for the fourth man . STO
* He had reached the three passive guards ; ; he crept in an _RARE_ manner , _RARE_ the ground before him . STO
* The guards did not look at him . STO
* The figure on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered . STO
* He sank back on his thin _RARE_ like a weary _RARE_ . STO
* Then he began to crawl again . STO
* Watson watched the creeping figure . STO
* He felt a _RARE_ interest . STO
* Would the man make it or not ? STO
* If only there was a clock for him to crawl against . STO
* If he failed to reach the _RARE_ in five minutes , say , then the _RARE_ would pull away and leave him _RARE_ in the mud . STO
* _RARE_ three minutes to make it _RARE_ . STO
* Still the guards did not move , but stood inert , _RARE_ from the _RARE_ man . STO
* The figure halted , and Watson gasped . STO
* The man began to creep in the wrong direction , _RARE_ by a slight rise in the ground ! STO
* He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the _RARE_ . STO
* Watson raced for him , his boots _RARE_ the soft earth . STO
* The guards came to life with astonishing _RARE_ . STO
* They spun and flung their rifles up . STO
* Watson _RARE_ wildly . STO
* One man dropped to his knee for better aim . STO
* -- Let me help him , for the love of God ! STO
* The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces . STO
* Watson _RARE_ to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily . STO
* He reached down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm . STO
* _RARE_ his _RARE_ , a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone . STO
* Watson bent _RARE_ and lifted the man to his feet . STO
* Watson stared into a _RARE_ face . STO
* Two _RARE_ balls the color of _RARE_ rolled between _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Light sticks of fingers , the tips _RARE_ with dark earth , patted at _RARE_ throat . STO
* The man's voice was a sweet , patient whisper . STO
* -- Henry said that he'd take my arm and get me right there . STO
* But you ain't Henry . STO
* -- no . STO
* -- It don't matter . STO
* Is it far ? STO
* How far could it be , Watson thought _RARE_ , how far can a blind man crawl ? STO
* Another body length or all the rest of his _RARE_ life ? STO
* -- Not far . STO
* -- You talk deep . STO
* Not like us _RARE_ . STO
* It _RARE_ the voice , _RARE_ in camp . STO
* You _RARE_ ? STO
* -- yes . STO
* Come on , now . STO
* Can you walk ? STO
* -- Why , course I can . STO
* I can walk real good . STO
* Watson stumbled down the bank . STO
* The man leaned his frail body against _RARE_ shoulder . STO
* He was no heavier than a child . STO
* Watson paused for breath . STO
* The man _RARE_ _RARE_ , his _RARE_ breath beating softly against _RARE_ neck . STO
* His sweet whisper came after great effort . STO
* -- Oh , Christ . STO
* I wish you was Henry . STO
* He promised to take me . STO
* -- _RARE_ . STO
* We're almost there . STO
* Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff . STO
* The man swayed on a _RARE_ , turning his ruined eyes from side to side . STO
* Watson turned away , _RARE_ for the first time in many months . STO
* He heard the patient voice calling . STO
* -- Henry ? STO
* Where are you , Henry ? STO
* -- Make him lie down ! STO
* Watson snatched a deep breath . STO
* He had not meant to shout . STO
* He stood with his back to the skiff . STO
* The men _RARE_ and scratched , begging to be taken away . STO
* Watson spoke _RARE_ to the dark night _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* -- _RARE_ you ! STO
* What do you do to them ? STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ at him _RARE_ . STO
* He was angry , _RARE_ . STO
* He had not felt that during the afternoon . STO
* No , nor later . STO
* All his emotions had been inward , _RARE_ . STO
* In war , on a night like this , it was only the _RARE_ emotions that _RARE_ , what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others . STO
* Yes . STO
* That was it . STO
* He was sure of it . STO
* John's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen . STO
* What a fool he had been to think of his brother ! STO
* So Charles was dead . STO
* What did it matter ? STO
* His name had been crossed off a list . STO
* Already his cool body lay in the ground . STO
* What words had any meaning ? STO
* What had he thought of , to go to John , _RARE_ and beg understanding ? STO
* To _RARE_ with a canvas chair as a _RARE_ , _RARE_ at his heart until a rough and stupid hand _RARE_ him rise and go ? STO
* Men were _RARE_ every day , tumbled into _RARE_ like so many torn _RARE_ flung down a portable _RARE_ . STO
* What made him think John had a right to witness his brother's _RARE_ ? STO
* What right had John to any special consideration ? STO
* Was John better , more _RARE_ ? STO
* To hell with John . STO
* Let him _RARE_ with impatience to see Charles , _RARE_ open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in _RARE_ beautiful , _RARE_ hand . STO
* John would _RARE_ . STO
* He believed that brave boys didn't cry . STO
* Watson spat on the ground . STO
* He was grimly satisfied . STO
* He had _RARE_ thought himself compelled to ease his brother's pain . STO
* Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering . STO
* I would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by _RARE_ , `` O _RARE_ , O _RARE_ , O _RARE_ and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter _RARE_ with four _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ , and three composition _RARE_ with long _RARE_ and red _RARE_ '' ? STO
* As I say , I wouldn't want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done . STO
* But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the _RARE_ and _RARE_ trees that grow on the ridge . STO
* I can see it from this window where I write . STO
* It was built by the _RARE_ , and stands on the _RARE_ of ground that _RARE_ our property . STO
* It _RARE_ under a _RARE_ of thin , new grass , like some _RARE_ fact of _RARE_ , and I think Mrs. Pastern set out the _RARE_ to _RARE_ its meaning . STO
* It would have been like her . STO
* She was a pale woman . STO
* _RARE_ on her _RARE_ , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground an _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ her a cup of tea and she would say , `` Why , these cups look just like a set I gave to the _RARE_ Army last year '' . STO
* _RARE_ her the new swimming pool and she would say , _RARE_ her ankle , `` I suppose this must be where you _RARE_ your gigantic _RARE_ '' . STO
* Hand her a chair and she would say , `` Why , it's a nice _RARE_ of those _RARE_ Anne chairs I inherited from _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* These _RARE_ were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children _RARE_ , and her marriage _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ years ago , she would have been known as a golf widow , and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of _RARE_ . STO
* She usually wore _RARE_ , and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr. Pastern was dead , but Mr. Pastern was far from dead . STO
* He was marching up and down the locker room of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Club shouting , `` _RARE_ Cuba ! STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ ! STO
* Let's throw a little nuclear _RARE_ at them and show them who's boss '' . STO
* He was _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ light _RARE_ , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and China . STO
* It all began on an autumn afternoon -- and who , after all these centuries , can describe the _RARE_ of an autumn day ? STO
* One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it . STO
* The clear and searching sweep of sun on the _RARE_ was like a _RARE_ of the year's lights . STO
* _RARE_ were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its _RARE_ _RARE_ , of beginnings . STO
* The _RARE_ blue air was stretched over the _RARE_ like the skin of a _RARE_ . STO
* Leaving her house one late afternoon , Mrs. Pastern stopped to _RARE_ the October light . STO
* It was the day to _RARE_ for infectious _RARE_ . STO
* Mrs. Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of _RARE_ . STO
* It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks . STO
* Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below . STO
* _RARE_ as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Mrs. _RARE_ worked for the brain . STO
* Mrs. Ten _RARE_ did mental health . STO
* Mrs. _RARE_ worked for the blind . STO
* Mrs. _RARE_ was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat . STO
* Mrs. _RARE_ was _RARE_ , Mrs. _RARE_ was _RARE_ March of _RARE_ , Mrs. _RARE_ was _RARE_ , and Mrs. _RARE_ did the _RARE_ . STO
* Mrs. _RARE_ led the _RARE_ _RARE_ , Mrs. _RARE_ was _RARE_ , and way in the distance could be seen the _RARE_ roof of _RARE_ _RARE_ house , a roof that _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Mrs. Pastern _RARE_ the work of going from house to house with the _RARE_ _RARE_ of an honest and traditional _RARE_ . STO
* It was her destiny ; ; it was her life . STO
* Her mother had done it before her , and even her old _RARE_ , who had collected money for _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Mrs. Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her . STO
* She experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling _RARE_ . STO
* Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ were ahead of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her _RARE_ with big checks . STO
* She stopped at the _RARE_ after dusk , and had a _RARE_ . STO
* She stayed too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband . STO
* `` I got a hundred and sixty dollars for the _RARE_ fund '' , she said excitedly when he walked in . STO
* `` I did everybody on my list but the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ . STO
* I want to get my _RARE_ in tomorrow morning -- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner '' ? STO
* `` But I don't know the _RARE_ '' , Charlie Pastern said . STO
* `` Nobody does , but they gave me ten last year '' . STO
* He was tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork _RARE_ in the _RARE_ only seemed like an extension of a _RARE_ day . STO
* He was happy enough to take the _RARE_ and race up the hill to the _RARE_ , thinking that they might give him a drink . STO
* But the _RARE_ were away ; ; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door . STO
* Turning in at the _RARE_ driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them . STO
* The name encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the _RARE_ . STO
* There was a glass _RARE_ in the front door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a _RARE_ woman with red hair was arranging flowers . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , he shouted heartily . STO
* She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door . STO
* `` Oh , please come in '' , she said . STO
* The _RARE_ voice was nearly a whisper . STO
* She was not a girl , he could see . STO
* Her hair was _RARE_ , and her _RARE_ was _RARE_ , and she must have been _RARE_ forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who _RARE_ to the manners and _RARE_ of a pretty child of eight . STO
* `` Your wife just called '' , she said , _RARE_ one word from another , exactly like a child . STO
* `` And I am not sure that I have any cash -- any money , that is -- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ you step into the living room , where it's _RARE_ '' ? STO
* A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these _RARE_ was _RARE_ . STO
* Where was Mr. Flannagan , he wondered . STO
* _RARE_ home on a late train ? STO
* _RARE_ his clothes upstairs ? STO
* _RARE_ a shower ? STO
* At the end of the room there was a desk _RARE_ with papers , and she began to _RARE_ these , making _RARE_ and and noises of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting '' , she said , `` but won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ? STO
* _RARE_ on the table '' . STO
* `` What train does Mr. Flannagan come out on '' ? STO
* `` Mr. Flannagan is away '' , she said . STO
* Her voice dropped . STO
* `` Mr. Flannagan has been away for six weeks . STO
* '' `` I'll have a drink , then , if you'll have one with me '' . STO
* `` If you will promise to make it weak '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ down '' , he said , `` and enjoy your drink and look for your _RARE_ later . STO
* The only way to find things is to relax '' . STO
* All in all , they had six drinks . STO
* She described herself and her circumstances _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ all over the world . STO
* She didn't like to travel . STO
* _RARE_ made her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home . STO
* She and her husband had _RARE_ lived in New York , where she had many friends , but Mr. Flannagan thought the country would be _RARE_ in case of war . STO
* She would rather live in danger than die of _RARE_ and boredom . STO
* She had no children ; ; she had made no friends . STO
* `` I've seen you , though , before '' , she said with enormous _RARE_ , _RARE_ his knee . STO
* `` I've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the _RARE_ . STO
* '' The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no _RARE_ functions . STO
* It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the _RARE_ . STO
* And knowing its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time of life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for _RARE_ ? STO
* The remarks she made about the _RARE_ of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her _RARE_ there . STO
* `` I've never done this before '' , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave . STO
* Her voice shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely . STO
* He didn't doubt her _RARE_ , although he had heard the words a hundred times . STO
* `` I've never done this before '' , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders . STO
* `` I've never done this before '' , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor . STO
* `` I've never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey . STO
* `` I've never done this before '' , they always said , putting on their stockings . STO
* On ships at sea , on railroad trains , in summer hotels with mountain views , they always said , `` I've never done this before '' . STO
* `` Where have you been '' ? STO
* Mrs. Pastern asked sadly , when he came in . STO
* `` It's after eleven '' . STO
* `` I had a drink with the _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` She told me he was in Germany '' . STO
* `` He came home unexpectedly '' . STO
* Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news . STO
* `` _RARE_ them '' ! STO
* He shouted . STO
* `` _RARE_ a little nuclear _RARE_ at them ! STO
* _RARE_ them who's boss '' ! STO
* But in bed he had trouble sleeping . STO
* He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college . STO
* He loved them . STO
* It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known . STO
* Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his _RARE_ , his _RARE_ , his _RARE_ , his _RARE_ , and his weather in detail , but the green of the _RARE_ seemed faded in the light of his business worries . STO
* His money was tied up in a _RARE_ hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for _RARE_ , and luck had been running against him . STO
* His worries _RARE_ him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window . STO
* In the _RARE_ he could see the trees stripped of their leaves . STO
* During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his _RARE_ tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the _RARE_ near _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth . STO
* Children walking home from school would _RARE_ through what seemed to be his _RARE_ . STO
* Then , getting back into bed , he thought _RARE_ of Mrs. Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do . STO
* There are , he thought , so few true means of _RARE_ in this life that why should he _RARE_ the medicine even when the medicine seemed , as it did , a little crude ? STO
* It was not as though she noted clearly that her _RARE_ had not been to see her for ten years , not since their last journey _RARE_ to witness their Uncle _RARE_ being lowered into the rocky soil ; ; that aside from due _RARE_ of certain major events in their lives ( two marriages , two _RARE_ , one divorce ) , Christmas and _RARE_ cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the _RARE_ years . STO
* Her thoughts were not discrete . STO
* But there was a look about her mouth as though she were _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight . STO
* She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray . STO
* There she extracted two limp _RARE_ sheets and wrote off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark . STO
* Once her trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , _RARE_ , as _RARE_ as they would dropping from her own lips . STO
* And the stiffly _RARE_ look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the _RARE_ of age which , _RARE_ the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string . STO
* `` Please come down as soon as you _RARE_ can '' , the upright letters stalked from the _RARE_ pen , `` I have an important matter to discuss with you '' . STO
* To Abel : `` I am afraid there is not much to _RARE_ small children here . STO
* I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your _RARE_ . STO
* You may stay as long as you wish , of course , but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account , I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in '' . STO
* To Mark : `` Please give my _RARE_ to Myra '' . STO
* She signed the letters quickly , _RARE_ them , and placed them on the hall table for _RARE_ to mail in town . STO
* Then she went back to the _RARE_ chair and _RARE_ adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water . STO
* `` My _RARE_ will be coming down '' , she said that evening as _RARE_ brought her dinner into the dining room , the whole meal on a vast _RARE_ tray . STO
* She looked at the girl _RARE_ from eyes which had _RARE_ with the years ; ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled _RARE_ to look at her in an _RARE_ way , they had faded to a _RARE_ of color which had , possibly from her constant looking at the water , something of the light of the sea in them . STO
* _RARE_ placed the tray on the table and with a _RARE_ of dark wrist drew off the cloth . STO
* She smiled , and the teeth _RARE_ in her _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ face . STO
* `` That will be so nice for you , Mrs. _RARE_ '' , she said . STO
* Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in _RARE_ _RARE_ before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , said the old lady , and brought her eyes down to the tray . STO
* `` You remember them , I suppose '' ? STO
* She _RARE_ _RARE_ at the dish before her : `` _RARE_ . STO
* I hope _RARE_ bought them whole '' . STO
* _RARE_ stepped back , her eyes _RARE_ the tray for _RARE_ . STO
* Then she looked at the old woman again , her eyes calm . STO
* `` Yes '' , she said , `` I remember that they came here every summer . STO
* I used to play with the older one sometimes , when he'd let me . STO
* Abel '' ? STO
* The name fell with lazy _RARE_ _RARE_ from her lips . STO
* For an instant the old _RARE_ felt something _RARE_ flash through her smile . STO
* She would have said triumph . STO
* Then _RARE_ turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen . STO
* Jessica _RARE_ lifted her head and followed the _RARE_ figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the _RARE_ rise and fall of the rounded hips . STO
* For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; ; then she _RARE_ and groped for her fork . STO
* There's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected _RARE_ , _RARE_ tender green _RARE_ on the silver fork , than the _RARE_ away of a family . STO
* _RARE_ , expansion , _RARE_ -- these are the laws of living things , with the penalty for not _RARE_ them the ultimate in _RARE_ : _RARE_ . STO
* When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted . STO
* And indeed the young garden _RARE_ were _RARE_ in her mouth . STO
* She was the last living of the older generation . STO
* What had once been a widespread family -- at one time , she knew , there were enough _RARE_ to _RARE_ an entire county -- had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark . STO
* She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently _RARE_ the bitter _RARE_ . STO
* What hope lay in the _RARE_ , she asked the _RARE_ light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other _RARE_ , having _RARE_ two girl children , with none to bear on the _RARE_ name ? STO
* She ate . STO
* It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became _RARE_ at the _RARE_ empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she _RARE_ with shadows . STO
* Here , too , she talked low , _RARE_ her head at one or another of the places , most often at _RARE_ _RARE_ which faced her across the long table . STO
* Or it might have been the absent _RARE_ she addressed , consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years . STO
* She thought again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate _RARE_ . STO
* The girl , her first , she barely remembered . STO
* It could have been _RARE_ infant , for it had not survived the _RARE_ . STO
* But the boy the boy had been alive yesterday . STO
* Each _RARE_ movement in his growing was recorded on the _RARE_ film inside her . STO
* He ran on his _RARE_ sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the _RARE_ photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat _RARE_ _RARE_ in the bottom drawer of the _RARE_ . STO
* In the cruel _RARE_ of her memory the boy remained _RARE_ , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still _RARE_ to her . STO
* It was one with the _RARE_ rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea . STO
* The brothers drove down together in _RARE_ small red sports car , Mark at the wheel . STO
* They rarely spoke . STO
* Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading out from both sides of the road , rolled _RARE_ up to where the silent white houses and long _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ into the _RARE_ fields . STO
* He saw the land with a _RARE_ eyes , all the old _RARE_ gone . STO
* And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , _RARE_ , complete in itself . STO
* There was stability there , too -- a color which his life had had once . STO
* That is what childhood is , he told himself . STO
* _RARE_ , settled lost . STO
* In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone _RARE_ he saw the _RARE_ pen _RARE_ of Aunt _RARE_ letter . STO
* What bad grace , what incredible _RARE_ he and Mark had shown . STO
* The _RARE_ summers preceding their _RARE_ funeral might never have been . STO
* They had closed over , absolutely , with the _RARE_ of old _RARE_ grave . STO
* The small car flew on _RARE_ . STO
* The old woman , _RARE_ _RARE_ in the house above the _RARE_ waters took on an ominous reality . STO
* Abel moved and adjusted his long legs . STO
* `` I suppose it has to do with the property '' , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their _RARE_ of the letters . STO
* Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his _RARE_ _RARE_ out in one _RARE_ moment of _RARE_ . STO
* He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the _RARE_ Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer . STO
* Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother . STO
* Mark held the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a _RARE_ way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd make in the years to come . STO
* His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and _RARE_ at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away . STO
* Mark easily looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably _RARE_ . STO
* The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea . STO
* `` She didn't mention bringing Myra '' , Mark said , _RARE_ the car into the next _RARE_ . STO
* `` She's probably getting old -- _RARE_ , I mean -- and we figured _RARE_ , better not . STO
* They've never met , you know . STO
* But Myra wouldn't _RARE_ without an express _RARE_ . STO
* I feel kind of bad about it '' . STO
* He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this _RARE_ of _RARE_ to guilt . STO
* `` I imagine the old girl hasn't missed us much '' , Mark added , his eyes on the road . STO
* Abel ignored the _RARE_ _RARE_ for confirmation . STO
* He smiled . STO
* It was barely possible that his brother was right . STO
* He could tell they were approaching the sea . STO
* The air took on a special strength now that they'd left the _RARE_ warmth of the _RARE_ behind . STO
* There was the smell of the coast , like a _RARE_ memory , composed of equal parts salt water , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and northern air . STO
* He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye again the great _RARE_ house which , built on one of the many acres of _RARE_ land _RARE_ the west harbor , had been _RARE_ _RARE_ to his _RARE_ as the last century ended . STO
* _RARE_ thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same _RARE_ in dirty white _RARE_ , _RARE_ out on top of the _RARE_ and coming upon the sudden _RARE_ water at the same instant . STO
* `` Remember the _RARE_ ? STO
* '' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the _RARE_ white _RARE_ which the car swallowed rapidly as it _RARE_ the crest of the hill and came down . STO
* `` The _RARE_ , '' Abel said . STO
* There was the day Uncle _RARE_ had , in an unexpected _RARE_ gesture , handed over the pretty _RARE_ to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished . STO
* The two of them had developed into a remarkable _RARE_ team all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their _RARE_ knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could . STO
* They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a _RARE_ which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually . STO
* He saw the _RARE_ as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point _RARE_ constant _RARE_ circles against a _RARE_ sky . STO
* Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ had been long at the bottom of the bay . STO
* They came unexpectedly upon the sea . STO
* _RARE_ it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them . STO
* They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly _RARE_ solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which _RARE_ out into a faint mist of light and ended . STO
* Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars . STO
* His eyes were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they'd glare at my noise , growing red and raising up his rage . STO
* I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldn't watch , dying just to _RARE_ Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a _RARE_ hall , Pa _RARE_ under the covers at the end like _RARE_ covered with snow , snoring and _RARE_ . STO
* Oh he'd not care about the Pedersen kid . STO
* He'd not care about getting _RARE_ so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain . STO
* That would make him mad enough if he was sober . STO
* I didn't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen . STO
* He was all _RARE_ up like I thought he'd be . STO
* I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name . STO
* I think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except to roll a little when I shoved him . STO
* The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , _RARE_ like a _RARE_ gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall -- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster -- and I thought , Well you don't look much like a _RARE_ _RARE_ now . STO
* I couldn't be sure he was still asleep . STO
* He was a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I shook him a little harder and made some noise . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* I was leaning too far over . STO
* I knew better . STO
* He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him . STO
* Oh he was smart . STO
* It put you off . STO
* I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid _RARE_ in all that dough . STO
* When his arm came up I _RARE_ away but it caught me on the side of the neck , _RARE_ my eyes , and I backed off to cough . STO
* Pa was on his side , looking at me , his eyes winking , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow . STO
* `` Get the hell out of here '' . STO
* I didn't say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him . STO
* He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear . STO
* It was better , though , he'd hit me . STO
* He was bitter when he missed . STO
* `` Get the hell out of here '' . STO
* `` Big Hans sent me . STO
* He told me to wake you '' . STO
* `` A fat hell on Big Hans . STO
* Get out of here '' . STO
* `` He found the Pedersen kid by the crib '' . STO
* `` Get the hell out '' . STO
* Pa pulled at the covers . STO
* He was _RARE_ his mouth . STO
* `` The kid's froze good . STO
* Hans is rubbing him with snow . STO
* He's got him in the kitchen '' . STO
* `` Pedersen '' ? STO
* `` No , Pa . STO
* It's the Pedersen kid . STO
* The kid '' . STO
* `` Nothing to _RARE_ from the crib '' . STO
* `` Not stealing , Pa . STO
* He was just lying there . STO
* Hans found him froze . STO
* That's where he was when Hans found him '' . STO
* Pa laughed . STO
* `` I ain't _RARE_ nothing in the crib '' . STO
* `` You don't understand , Pa . STO
* The Pedersen kid . STO
* The kid '' -- `` I goddamn well understand '' . STO
* Pa had his head up , _RARE_ , his teeth _RARE_ at the place where he'd grown a _RARE_ once . STO
* `` I goddamn well understand . STO
* You know I don't want to see Pedersen . STO
* That _RARE_ . STO
* Why should I ? STO
* What did he come for , _RARE_ ? STO
* God _RARE_ , get . STO
* And don't come back . STO
* _RARE_ out something . STO
* You're a fool . STO
* Both you and Hans . STO
* Pedersen . STO
* That _RARE_ . STO
* Don't come back . STO
* Out . STO
* Out '' . STO
* He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow . STO
* He had long black hairs on his wrist . STO
* They curled around the _RARE_ of his _RARE_ . STO
* `` Big Hans made me come . STO
* Big Hans said '' -- `` A fat hell on Big Hans . STO
* He's an even bigger fool than you are . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ ? STO
* I taught him , _RARE_ , and I'll teach you . STO
* Out . STO
* You want me to drop my pot '' ? STO
* He was about to get up so I got out , _RARE_ the door . STO
* He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep . STO
* Then he threw things . STO
* Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ been _RARE_ in that pot . STO
* Hans got an _RARE_ . STO
* He didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he _RARE_ part of _RARE_ door down before he stopped . STO
* He might not have gone that far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house . STO
* That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it . STO
* I always felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their _RARE_ like a laugh or a _RARE_ , as eager as an animal to be out . STO
* I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs . STO
* Hans had laid _RARE_ towels over the kid's chest and stomach . STO
* He was rubbing snow on the kid's legs and feet . STO
* _RARE_ from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning _RARE_ , sticking to the kid's back and behind . STO
* `` _RARE_ he going to wake up '' ? STO
* `` What about your _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` He was awake when I left '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ he say ? STO
* Did you get the whisky '' ? STO
* `` He said a fat hell on Big Hans '' . STO
* `` Don't be smart . STO
* Did you ask him about the whisky '' ? STO
* `` Yeah '' . STO
* `` Well '' ? STO
* `` He said a fat hell on Big Hans '' . STO
* `` Don't be smart . STO
* What's he going to do '' ? STO
* `` Go back to sleep most likely '' . STO
* `` You'd best get that whisky '' . STO
* `` You go . STO
* Take the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ scared to hell of axes '' . STO
* `` Listen to me , _RARE_ , I've had enough to your _RARE_ . STO
* This kid's froze bad . STO
* If I don't get some whisky down him he might die . STO
* You want the kid to die ? STO
* Do you ? STO
* Well , get your _RARE_ and get that whisky '' . STO
* `` Pa don't care about the kid '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Well he don't . STO
* He don't care at all , and I don't care to get my head _RARE_ neither . STO
* He don't care , and I don't care to have his _RARE_ flung on me . STO
* He don't care about anybody . STO
* All he _RARE_ about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face . STO
* Get _RARE_ -- that's what he wants . STO
* He don't care about nothing else at all . STO
* Nothing . STO
* Not _RARE_ kid neither . STO
* That _RARE_ . STO
* Not the kid neither '' . STO
* `` I'll get the spirits '' , Ma said . STO
* I'd wound Big Hans up tight . STO
* I was ready to jump but when Ma said she'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down . STO
* Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off . STO
* Not any more . STO
* Not for years . STO
* The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot _RARE_ , and maybe she saw him _RARE_ it again , the dirty _RARE_ _RARE_ out as it flew . STO
* It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the _RARE_ while he was still _RARE_ with _RARE_ yellow sick _RARE_ . STO
* `` No you won't '' , Big Hans said . STO
* `` Yes , Hans , if they're needed '' , Ma said . STO
* Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her . STO
* If we had , then one of us would have had to go instead . STO
* Hans rubbed the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed . STO
* `` I'll get more snow '' , I said . STO
* I took the _RARE_ and shovel and went out on the porch . STO
* I don't know where Ma went . STO
* I thought she'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had . STO
* She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat . STO
* Oh , he was being _RARE_ and careful , _RARE_ about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm . STO
* He was awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma wasn't thinking about that at all , not anything like that . STO
* There was no way of getting even . STO
* It wasn't like getting _RARE_ at the fair . STO
* They were always trying so you got to expect it . STO
* Now Hans had given Ma something of his -- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa -- something valuable ; ; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back . STO
* Hans cut the foil off finally and _RARE_ the cap . STO
* He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she'd done . STO
* Ma had found one of _RARE_ hiding places . STO
* She'd found one and she hadn't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the _RARE_ and found the first one . STO
* Pa had a _RARE_ for hiding . STO
* He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it . STO
* But now Ma . STO
* She'd found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't know how long ago _RARE_ been or how many other ones she'd found , saying nothing . STO
* Pa was sure to find out . STO
* Sometimes he didn't seem to because he _RARE_ them so well he couldn't find them himself or because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't _RARE_ one after all or had drunk it up . STO
* But he'd find out about this one because we were using it . STO
* A fool could see what was going on . STO
* If he found out Ma found it -- _RARE_ be bad . STO
* He took pride in his hiding . STO
* It was all the pride he had . STO
* I guess _RARE_ Hans and me took doing . STO
* But he didn't figure Ma for much . STO
* He didn't figure her at all , and if he found out a woman _RARE_ be bad . STO
* Hans poured some in a _RARE_ . STO
* `` You going to put more towels on him '' ? STO
* `` No '' . STO
* `` Why not ? STO
* That's what he needs , something warm to his skin , don't he '' ? STO
* `` Not where he's froze good . STO
* _RARE_ bad for _RARE_ . STO
* That's why I only put towels on his chest and belly . STO
* He's got to _RARE_ slow . STO
* You ought to know that '' . STO
* _RARE_ on the towels had run . STO
* Ma _RARE_ her _RARE_ in the kid's clothes . STO
* `` What are we going to do with these '' ? STO
* Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin . STO
* `` Here , help me _RARE_ him up . STO
* I got hold his mouth open '' . STO
* I didn't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't make any move to . STO
* `` Come on , _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` All right '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , don't _RARE_ lift '' . STO
* `` O.K. , I'm _RARE_ '' . STO
* I took him by the shoulders . STO
* His head flopped back . STO
* His mouth fell open . STO
* The skin on his neck was tight . STO
* He was cold all right . STO
* `` Hold his head up . STO
* He'll choke '' . STO
* `` His mouth is open '' . STO
* `` His _RARE_ shut . STO
* He'll choke '' . STO
* `` He'll choke anyway '' . STO
* `` Hold his head up '' . STO
* `` I can't '' . STO
* `` Don't hold him like that . STO
* Put your arms around him '' . STO
* `` Well Jesus '' . STO
* He was cold all right . STO
* I put my arm carefully around him . STO
* Hans had his fingers in the kid's mouth . STO
* `` Now he'll choke for sure '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ up . STO
* Just hold him like I told you '' . STO
* He was cold all right , and wet . STO
* I had my arm behind his back . STO
* He was in his _RARE_ at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be _RARE_ yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had _RARE_ off _RARE_ . STO
* There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; ; it was always the same _RARE_ success now . STO
* He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same _RARE_ technique , they were such _RARE_ and sometimes even _RARE_ buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic _RARE_ about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer _RARE_ as to its other values . STO
* Stowey _RARE_ was _RARE_ famous , a _RARE_ of a genuine _RARE_ in foreign eyes , an original _RARE_ whose _RARE_ _RARE_ with steel and concrete was made even more _RARE_ sincere by his personality . STO
* He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; ; he rose at _RARE_ six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn _RARE_ and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last _RARE_ Herald Tribune and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , then put on his _RARE_ _RARE_ shoes and walked under a _RARE_ _RARE_ to his workshop . STO
* This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every _RARE_ during his six years as an oil _RARE_ . STO
* The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; ; a pile of wire _RARE_ for mice from his time as a _RARE_ and a _RARE_ lying on its side on the window _RARE_ , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with _RARE_ steel _RARE_ _RARE_ out into the air , _RARE_ _RARE_ on the floor from the time he was _RARE_ his _RARE_ _RARE_ whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire _RARE_ on each floor . STO
* His files , desk , _RARE_ board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ from his painting days , and _RARE_ a _RARE_ of _RARE_ books that looked as though their _RARE_ had been _RARE_ by a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ he had once used as the basis of the design for the _RARE_ _RARE_ Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of _RARE_ _RARE_ which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house . STO
* He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , _RARE_ with the surprised stare of one who was watching another _RARE_ hand . STO
* Sometimes he would _RARE_ softly to some invisible _RARE_ beside him , sometimes he would look stern and _RARE_ as his pencil did what he _RARE_ . STO
* It all seemed -- if one could have _RARE_ in at him through one of his windows -- as though this _RARE_ man with the muscular arms and _RARE_ neck was merely the _RARE_ trying his hand at the _RARE_ work . STO
* This air of _RARE_ carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often _RARE_ it for boredom in him or a surrender to _RARE_ routine . STO
* But he was not _RARE_ at all ; ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it . STO
* There are , after all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man . STO
* He left his home the day after New _RARE_ wearing a _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ and without a hat . STO
* He would wear this same costume in Florida , despite his wife _RARE_ _RARE_ over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him . STO
* But he was too busy to hear what she was saying . STO
* So they parted when she was in an impatient humor . STO
* When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , feeling in his _RARE_ _RARE_ for the _RARE_ key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous _RARE_ _RARE_ over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window . STO
* _RARE_ the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , `` _RARE_ the refrigerator '' . STO
* He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the _RARE_ expression he had ever seen . STO
* He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him . STO
* He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; ; an _RARE_ laugh which always carried everything before it . STO
* He would settle himself into his seat to laugh . STO
* Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing . STO
* And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the _RARE_ dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going away when he really didn't have to , mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by . STO
* She was _RARE_ at this time , a _RARE_ woman of _RARE_ with an _RARE_ , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some _RARE_ that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer . STO
* Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders . STO
* There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the _RARE_ look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an _RARE_ line long since _RARE_ from _RARE_ and which , besides , has kept its estate intact . STO
* She was personally _RARE_ , and when she had _RARE_ would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , _RARE_ from her waist , and when she _RARE_ she would eat dinner with dirt on her _RARE_ . STO
* But just when she seemed to have sunk into some _RARE_ of _RARE_ she would disappear and come down _RARE_ , brushed , and taking _RARE_ of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a _RARE_ with a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a grace of history , so to speak , and for an instant one saw how _RARE_ proud she was and _RARE_ on certain questions of personal value . STO
* She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp . STO
* `` Now drive carefully , for God's sake '' ! STO
* She called , trying to attain a half _RARE_ resentment at his departure . STO
* But he did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* To the _RARE_ of a tree as he passed it , the same _RARE_ which had _RARE_ the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed . STO
* She stood clutching her _RARE_ around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road . STO
* Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window . STO
* She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . STO
* He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his _RARE_ hair was _RARE_ a little and his breath came hard through his _RARE_ lungs , the look of the _RARE_ youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the _RARE_ _RARE_ on a Thursday once . STO
* Now she kept herself _RARE_ ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the _RARE_ with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked . STO
* She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building . STO
* There is a death in all _RARE_ , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind . STO
* She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the _RARE_ part of life . STO
* Now she could let out the three _RARE_ without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; ; she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ on the _RARE_ ; ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as well as the news , _RARE_ nothing on her mind but letting her soul _RARE_ itself above all _RARE_ and desire . STO
* She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting to be . STO
* She fell asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house _RARE_ as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their _RARE_ and the occasional _RARE_ of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of her arm . STO
* Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and _RARE_ was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers . STO
* Then she fell asleep again as _RARE_ as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . STO
* She stood up , _RARE_ her hair down , _RARE_ her clothes , feeling a _RARE_ for the _RARE_ darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she _RARE_ a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head _RARE_ , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for _RARE_ to come with her guests . STO
* She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the _RARE_ on the barn , _RARE_ the driveway . STO
* She knew she was feeling afraid and _RARE_ laughed at herself . STO
* They were both so young , after all , so _RARE_ for any final _RARE_ . STO
* How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ? STO
* But yes , nineteen plus thirty was _RARE_ , and she was _RARE_ and she had been married at nineteen . STO
* She stood still over the leg of _RARE_ , rubbing _RARE_ into it , quite suddenly conscious of a _RARE_ in her stomach and a feeling of _RARE_ , a sensation of violence that started her shivering . STO
* But they all said , `` No , your time will come . STO
* _RARE_ being a bride while you can '' . STO
* There was no room for company in the tiny _RARE_ House ( where the _RARE_ boys always took their _RARE_ , till they could get a house and a farm of their own ) . STO
* So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the _RARE_ found beds for everyone in their own homes . STO
* And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do . STO
* So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her _RARE_ . STO
* Without saying so , she was really grateful ; ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby _RARE_ wife . STO
* She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it _RARE_ and neat , _RARE_ as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe . STO
* She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this . STO
* People died , she would have said , in _RARE_ , or in cars on the highway at night . STO
* Bobby Joe was gone all day now , not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper . STO
* When they first married he had been working in the fields all day , and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working , to take him a fresh hot meal . STO
* Now there was no work in the fields , nor would there be till it _RARE_ , and she did not know where he went . STO
* Not that she complained , or had any cause to . STO
* Four or five of the cousins from East _RARE_ were about his age , so naturally they ran around together . STO
* There was no reason for her to ask what they did . STO
* Thus a new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny _RARE_ did not die . STO
* She lay still on the bed , her head hardly _RARE_ the pillow ; ; sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around , and sometimes she took a little milk or _RARE_ . STO
* They stopped expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two . STO
* Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home , for she might die any time ; ; but they might as well _RARE_ their _RARE_ , for she might _RARE_ on . STO
* So the pattern was established . STO
* When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and _RARE_ her _RARE_ _RARE_ , she would go to the Big House . STO
* There was not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be . STO
* Bobby Joe and the boys would come by , say `` How's Granny '' ? STO
* And sit on the porch a while . STO
* The older men would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town . STO
* The women and children stayed at the _RARE_ . STO
* The women , keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room , sounded like chickens shut up in a _RARE_ for the night . STO
* The children had to play away from the house ( in the barn _RARE_ or the _RARE_ behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and on , all day , someone would be _RARE_ at the _RARE_ gray dust that settled over everything . STO
* The _RARE_ cooler had been moved to _RARE_ room , and her door was kept shut ; ; so that the rest of the house stayed open , though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way . STO
* The dust _RARE_ their _RARE_ , and the heat _RARE_ them , so that the women were always making ice water . STO
* They had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy _RARE_ blocks of ice in town , as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the _RARE_ who ate and drank there . STO
* One afternoon , as the women sat _RARE_ softly , a new _RARE_ of people pulled up at the gate . STO
* It was a _RARE_ , black _RARE_ with the dust of the road , its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and _RARE_ . STO
* They were an old fat couple ( as Linda Kay described them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve . STO
* There was much _RARE_ , much _RARE_ . STO
* `` Cousin Ada ! STO
* Cousin John '' ! STO
* `` Cousin _RARE_ '' ! STO
* `` Cousin Howard '' ! STO
* `` And how is she '' ? STO
* `` About the same , John , about the same '' . STO
* All the women got up and offered their chairs , and when they were all seated again , the guests made their inquiries and their explanations . STO
* `` We were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used to _RARE_ , `` and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home . STO
* We came on as soon as we could '' . STO
* There was the suggestion of ice water , and -- in spite of the protest `` We're not really _RARE_ '' -- Linda Kay , to escape the _RARE_ air and the _RARE_ soft voices , hurried to the kitchen . STO
* She filled a big pitcher and set it , with glasses , on a tray . STO
* _RARE_ it to the living room , she imagined the picture she made : tall and _RARE_ _RARE_ , a bit sophisticated in her yellow _RARE_ , with a _RARE_ _RARE_ walk that she had learned as a _RARE_ with the school band . STO
* Almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling _RARE_ , at such a time , in such a place , and she tossed back her long yellow hair , smiling _RARE_ as she entered the room . STO
* Howard ( the thick middle-aged man ) was looking at her . STO
* She felt the look and looked back because she could not help it , seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed . STO
* `` And who is this '' ? STO
* He asked , when she passed him a glass . STO
* `` Oh that's Linda Kay '' , Mama _RARE_ said _RARE_ . STO
* `` She married our baby boy , Bobby Joe , this summer '' . STO
* `` Let's see '' , Cousin Ada said . STO
* `` He's a right smart younger than the rest '' ? STO
* `` Oh yes '' , Mama laughed . STO
* `` He's ten years younger than _RARE_ . STO
* We didn't expect him to come along ; ; thought for the _RARE_ he was a tumor '' . STO
* This joke was not funny to Linda Kay , and she blushed , as she always did ; ; then , hearing the muffled _RARE_ of _RARE_ laughter , blushed _RARE_ . STO
* `` Who is Howard , anyway '' ? STO
* She asked Bobby Joe that night . STO
* `` He makes me uncomfortable '' . STO
* `` Oh he's a second cousin or something . STO
* He got in the oil business out at _RARE_ and _RARE_ into some money '' . STO
* `` How old is he '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ , I don't know . STO
* _RARE_ , I guess . STO
* He's been married and got this _RARE_ kid . STO
* If he _RARE_ you , don't pay him any mind . STO
* He's just a big _RARE_ '' . STO
* Bobby Joe was thinking about something else . STO
* `` _RARE_ , did you know they're fixing to have a _RARE_ antelope season on the _RARE_ J '' ? STO
* He was talking about antelope again when they woke up . STO
* `` Listen , I never had a chance to kill an antelope . STO
* There never was a season before , but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Did he ever visit here when he was a kid '' ? STO
* Linda Kay asked . STO
* `` Who '' ? STO
* `` Howard '' . STO
* `` Hell , I don't know . STO
* When he was a kid I wasn't around '' . STO
* Bobby Joe took a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` _RARE_ now '' was gone for the day . STO
* Almost immediately Howard and his daughter _RARE_ drove up in the _RARE_ . STO
* `` We're going after ice '' , Howard said , `` and thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company '' . STO
* There was really no reason to refuse , and Linda Kay had never _RARE_ in a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ along the _RARE_ road to town , Howard talked . STO
* Finally he said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life . STO
* She was such a _RARE_ _RARE_ , having been a _RARE_ , Future _RARE_ _RARE_ , and secretary of Future _RARE_ . STO
* In her _RARE_ year she had started going steady with Bobby Joe , who was a _RARE_ player , Future _RARE_ _RARE_ , and president of Future _RARE_ . STO
* It was easy to see that they were made for each other , and they knew what they wanted . STO
* Bobby Joe would be a senior this year , and he planned to _RARE_ . STO
* But there was no need for Linda Kay to go on , since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and ( _RARE_ ) raise his children . STO
* Howard sighed . STO
* `` You lucky kids '' , he said . STO
* `` I'd give anything if I could have found a girl like you '' . STO
* Then he told Linda Kay about himself . STO
* Of course he couldn't say much , really , because of _RARE_ , but Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got . STO
* It made her feel different about Howard . STO
* She was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had been , but he brought one of the cousins home for supper , and all they did was talk about antelope . STO
* Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home . STO
* `` Cook a whole antelope '' ? STO
* She exclaimed . STO
* `` Why , I couldn't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; ; I never even saw any '' . STO
* `` Oh , you could . STO
* I want to _RARE_ the whole thing , and have it for the boys '' . STO
* Linda Kay told him he couldn't do anything like that with his Grandma dying , and he said well they had to eat , didn't they , they weren't all dying . STO
* Linda Kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry ; ; but they were going up to the Big House after supper , and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little . STO
* Every night they all went to Mama and Papa _RARE_ , and sat on the open front porch , where they could get the breeze . STO
* It was _RARE_ ( or a little past ) , and nearly light as day . STO
* They all sat around and drank ice water , and the men smoked , and everybody had a good time . STO
* Once in a while they said what a shame it was , with Granny dying , but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other way . STO
* That night the older men got to talking about going _RARE_ on a moonlight night . STO
* Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been _RARE_ , and Uncle Bill _RARE_ ( from Mama _RARE_ side of the family ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right then . STO
* After they had left , some of the people moved around , to find more comfortable places to sit . STO
* There were not many chairs , so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch , resting their feet on the ground , and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall . STO
* Howard , who had been sitting against the wall , said he needed more fresh air , and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been sitting . STO
* `` You'll be a _RARE_ sight more comfortable there , Howard '' , _RARE_ said , laughing , and they all laughed . STO
* Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable . STO
* Bobby Joe had been sitting close to her , touching her actually , and holding her hand from time to time , but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer . STO
* Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh , so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers ; ; but she had never been so aware of _RARE_ flesh before . STO
* Still she was not sorry he sat by her , but in fact was _RARE_ . STO
* He had become the center of the company , such stories he had to tell . STO
* He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope and _RARE_ _RARE_ in person ; ; he had helped fight an _RARE_ fire that raged six days and nights . STO
* `` But tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Alex asked . STO
* `` That will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor _RARE_ , _RARE_ Alex's _RARE_ . STO
* `` What I want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help _RARE_ the hen back into the hotel '' . STO
* The doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel , room number nine , to _RARE_ Alex further into these _RARE_ . STO
* The doctor opened the smallest of his cases , an _RARE_ straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex's inspection . STO
* Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a _RARE_ _RARE_ was required to detect what _RARE_ valuable _RARE_ lay inside ; ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual _RARE_ eggs . STO
* There was little enough time to _RARE_ them , however ; ; in an instant the doctor was _RARE_ across the room with an antique _RARE_ in his hands , thoroughly _RARE_ and big as a table top . STO
* He placed it on Alex's lap . STO
* `` This is my hen _RARE_ '' , he informed him in an absorbed way . STO
* `` It's been going since _RARE_ when I was a junior in college . STO
* That first entry there is the Vermont _RARE_ , the earliest and one of the most successful of my _RARE_ _RARE_ -- great big _RARE_ and hardly any _RARE_ at all . STO
* _RARE_ take them near a river , though , or they'd _RARE_ like a _RARE_ _RARE_ the day before Thanksgiving '' . STO
* The _RARE_ was full of most precise information : date of laying , length of _RARE_ period , number of _RARE_ reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of _RARE_ _RARE_ and so on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more _RARE_ than English , the most _RARE_ and sprawling Alex had ever seen . STO
* Below these _RARE_ was a series of _RARE_ connected by arrows and _RARE_ which denoted the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* Alex's instruction was rapid , for the doctor had to go off to the _RARE_ _RARE_ De _RARE_ to hear more speeches with only time for one _RARE_ of wine to sustain him through them all . STO
* But after the doctor's return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its _RARE_ powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a _RARE_ hen . STO
* A knocking at Alex's door _RARE_ him at six o'clock the following morning . STO
* It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste . STO
* The doctor stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the _RARE_ _RARE_ , past the bedroom of the _RARE_ , and so into the street . STO
* The market was not far and , once there , the doctor's sense of _RARE_ left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him . STO
* He _RARE_ the _RARE_ and they responded with delighted _RARE_ , he _RARE_ with the _RARE_ and they at once were all attention , he _RARE_ with the _RARE_ , and _RARE_ with a pair of exceedingly _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his _RARE_ when quite abruptly something broke his _RARE_ . STO
* It was a fine _RARE_ hen , white , with a _RARE_ eye and a striking _RARE_ of feathers in the under region of the _RARE_ . STO
* The doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex's attention to those _RARE_ which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in comb and _RARE_ , the length and quality of neck and saddle _RARE_ , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare _RARE_ in the formation of the ear _RARE_ . STO
* All search was ended ; ; he had found his _RARE_ . STO
* The purchase was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set up , _RARE_ in the doctor's arms . STO
* The _RARE_ struck _RARE_ as they approached the hotel entrance ; ; and hopes that the _RARE_ and _RARE_ would still be _RARE_ began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast . STO
* The doctor was wearing a long New England greatcoat , hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well _RARE_ to the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_ on his left side where the hen was _RARE_ . STO
* They advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up , with _RARE_ steps , towards the first landing . STO
* It was then that they heard the _RARE_ of one descending and , in some _RARE_ glancing up , saw the _RARE_ coming towards them as they gained the landing . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , she greeted them pleasantly . STO
* Alex explained that they had been out for a _RARE_ before breakfast while the doctor _RARE_ around behind him , attempting to hide the _RARE_ at his left side behind Alex's arm and back . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ de suite _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Their hostess _RARE_ . STO
* Alex told her that there was no hurry for their _RARE_ , trying at the same time to effect a _RARE_ separation of the persons before and behind him . STO
* The doctor , he noticed , was attempting a _RARE_ movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be completed a distinct and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ the air in the hollow of the _RARE_ . STO
* Eyes _RARE_ in the _RARE_ head , Alex _RARE_ loudly , and the doctor , with a _RARE_ of chicken noises floating behind him , took to the stairs in _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* _RARE_ the surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , _RARE_ from her without ceremony , only offered a few words about the doctor's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work . STO
* With that he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze . STO
* When Alex entered his room , the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case , six eggs ready for the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* There was no reference to the incident on the stairs , his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business . STO
* The hen appeared to have no _RARE_ as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them . STO
* One part of her audience was totally engaged , the _RARE_ _RARE_ a _RARE_ fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand . STO
* The spectacle progressed towards a _RARE_ which was obviously still remote ; ; the audience attended . STO
* Time _RARE_ but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an _RARE_ knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature . STO
* _RARE_ , he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view , and Alex went to the door . STO
* He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and scraping noise as possible in order to _RARE_ _RARE_ from the hen who had begun to protest . STO
* It was _RARE_ , the fille de _RARE_ , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears _RARE_ up and regard all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the _RARE_ bird . STO
* _RARE_ was reluctant but Alex succeeded in _RARE_ her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again . STO
* `` Who was that , young _RARE_ '' ? STO
* The doctor instantly asked . STO
* `` That was the fille de _RARE_ , the one you thought couldn't get the eggs out . STO
* She looked mighty interested , though . STO
* _RARE_ she's coming back in five minutes to do the room '' . STO
* The doctor's mind was working at a great speed ; ; he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a _RARE_ voice . STO
* `` Have you got our keys _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Right in my pocket '' . STO
* `` All right . STO
* Now you go outside and _RARE_ me when it's safe '' . STO
* The hall was empty and Alex _RARE_ ; ; they climbed the stairs which creaked , very loudly to their sensitive ears , and reached the next floor . STO
* A guest was locking his room ; ; they passed behind him and got to Alex's room _RARE_ . STO
* The doctor sat down rather wearily , _RARE_ the hen and _RARE_ that the city was not the place for a _RARE_ man , but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more . STO
* At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly _RARE_ fille de _RARE_ to return in ten minutes . STO
* It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected , and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began Alex's . STO
* They waited three minutes and then crept out on _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door . STO
* A _RARE_ of sheets being smoothed and _RARE_ being arranged indicated the fille de _RARE_ presence inside ; ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact . STO
* The doctor shot down to the _RARE_ and turned the _RARE_ , but to no effect : the _RARE_ was occupied . STO
* Although a look of alarm passed over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the _RARE_ emerged from number nine . STO
* Alex _RARE_ those expressions of relief which offered to _RARE_ in his face and escape from his throat ; ; _RARE_ they were in any case for , as he stood facing the fille de _RARE_ , his ears were _RARE_ by new sounds from the interior of the shower room . STO
* The events of the last quarter of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of _RARE_ _RARE_ , perhaps _RARE_ her nest , but briefly enjoyed . STO
* The doctor's _RARE_ had not left him , however , for all his _RARE_ years , and the _RARE_ were almost immediately lost in the sound of water _RARE_ out from the _RARE_ . STO
* Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's room . STO
* _RARE_ , the doctor himself entered , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures . STO
* Without comment he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a _RARE_ around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside . STO
* Next , the hen was _RARE_ and all seemed well . STO
* The two men sat for some time , _RARE_ the pleasure of escape from _RARE_ and the relief such escape brings , before they got up and left the hotel , the doctor to go to the conference house and Alex to go to the main post office . STO
* Alex returned to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an _RARE_ mood . STO
* At the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settled herself on the nest most _RARE_ after the occurrences of the morning . STO
* `` _RARE_ have short _RARE_ '' , the doctor remarked , `` that's why they are better company than most people I know '' , and he went on to break some important news to Alex . STO
* `` Well '' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those _RARE_ over at the conference house do . STO
* They've got a big _RARE_ from _RARE_ at the _RARE_ here , with a wife for him , too , very rare birds , both of them , the only _RARE_ of their species outside Africa . STO
* Seems like she's willing , but the male just _RARE_ around all day like the _RARE_ boy who took _RARE_ May behind the barn and then didn't know what to do , and the people at the _RARE_ haven't got any _RARE_ _RARE_ to show for their trouble . STO
* _RARE_ downstairs with the tray , Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada , but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that _RARE_ look . STO
* There were times it wasn't right to make a person happy , like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we don't keep _RARE_ `` butter for a _RARE_ butter sandwich . STO
* You in this house '' , he always told her . STO
* `` Why , Winston '' , she'd cry , `` I just now saw you eating it out of the jar '' ! STO
* But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure . STO
* In the kitchen , Leona , his little young wife , was reading the morning paper . STO
* Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool . STO
* `` Here '' , Winston said gently , `` what's these dishes doing not washed '' ? STO
* The enormous plates which had held Mr. Jack's four _RARE_ eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink . STO
* `` Leave me alone '' , Leona said . STO
* `` Can't you see I'm busy '' ? STO
* She looked at him _RARE_ over the corner of the paper . STO
* `` This is moving day '' , Winston reminded her , `` and I bet you left things every which way upstairs , your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made . STO
* Leona '' ! STO
* His eye had _RARE_ on her leg ; ; bending , he touched her knee . STO
* `` If I catch you one more time down here without stockings '' -- She _RARE_ her leg away . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ , old man '' . STO
* She had an alley _RARE_ manners . STO
* Winston stacked Miss _RARE_ thin pink dishes in the sink . STO
* Then he spread out the last list on the counter . STO
* `` To Be _RARE_ Behind '' was printed at the top in Miss Ada ; ; fine hand . STO
* Winston took out a pencil , admired the point , and wrote slowly and heavily , `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ , Leona dropped the paper and stood up . STO
* `` I guess I better get ready to go '' . STO
* Winston watched her _RARE_ to _RARE_ her apron . STO
* `` Here '' . STO
* _RARE_ , he _RARE_ the bow . STO
* `` How come your _RARE_ is always _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She turned and put her arms around his neck . STO
* `` I don't want to leave here , Winston '' . STO
* `` Now listen to that '' . STO
* He drew back , embarrassed and pleased . STO
* `` I thought you was sick to death of this big house . STO
* Said you wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms '' . STO
* `` At least there is room here '' , she said . STO
* `` What room is there going to be in an apartment for any child '' ? STO
* `` I told you what Miss _RARE_ doctor said '' . STO
* `` I don't mean Miss Ada ! STO
* What you think I care about that ? STO
* I mean our children '' . STO
* She sounded as though they already existed . STO
* In spite of the hundred things he had on his mind , Winston went and put his arm around her waist . STO
* `` We've got plenty of time to think about that . STO
* All the time in the world . STO
* We've only been married four years , January '' . STO
* `` Four years '' ! STO
* She _RARE_ . STO
* `` That's a long time , waiting '' . STO
* `` How many times have I told you '' -- he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off -- `` Too many times '' ! STO
* -- and _RARE_ to the sink , where she began _RARE_ to wash her hands . STO
* Too many times was the truth of it , Winston thought . STO
* He hardly believed his reason himself any more . STO
* Although it had seemed a good reason , to begin with : no couple could afford to have children . STO
* `` How you going to work with a child hanging on you '' ? STO
* He asked Leona . STO
* `` You want to keep this job , don't you '' ? STO
* He doubted whether she heard him , over the running water . STO
* He sat for a while with his hands on his knees , watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things -- a comb , a bottle of _RARE_ -- to take upstairs and pack . STO
* She made him sad some days , and he was never sure why ; ; it was something to do with her back , the _RARE_ of it , and the quick , _RARE_ way she bent . STO
* She was too young , that was all ; ; too young and thin and straight . STO
* `` Winston '' ! STO
* It was Mr. Jack , _RARE_ out in the hall . STO
* Winston hurried through the swinging door . STO
* `` I've been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr. Jack complained . STO
* He was standing in front of the mirror , _RARE_ his tie . STO
* He had on his gray _RARE_ overcoat and his city hat , and his brief case lay on the bench . STO
* `` I don't know what you think you've been doing about my clothes '' , he said . STO
* `` This coat looks like a _RARE_ heap '' . STO
* There were a few _RARE_ of _RARE_ on the shoulder . STO
* Winston took the _RARE_ out of the closet and went to work . STO
* He gave Mr. Jack a real _RARE_ ; ; he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm _RARE_ . STO
* `` Hey '' ! STO
* Mr. Jack cried when the brush _RARE_ his hat down over his eyes . STO
* Winston _RARE_ and quickly set the hat right . STO
* Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack , who was pulling on his _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Winston enjoyed seeing him start out ; ; he wore his clothes with style . STO
* When he was going to town , nothing was good enough -- he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a _RARE_ of _RARE_ on his _RARE_ . STO
* At home , he wouldn't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ smoking _RARE_ , _RARE_ , wine , and blue , which Miss Ada had bought him hung brushed and _RARE_ in the closet . STO
* `` _RARE_ , Winston '' , Mr. Jack said , giving a final set to his hat . STO
* `` Look out for those _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car ; ; a handsome , _RARE_ man it made him proud to see . STO
* After Mr. Jack drove away , Winston went on looking out the window . STO
* He noticed a _RARE_ of dirt on the _RARE_ and _RARE_ at it with his finger . STO
* Then he looked at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy _RARE_ and the thick nail he used like a knife to _RARE_ up , slit , and open . STO
* For the first time , he be sad about the move . STO
* That house was ten years off his life let himself . STO
* Each brass handle and _RARE_ _RARE_ for his reward , and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the _RARE_ . STO
* He knew the house like a blind man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think of all the time and _RARE_ and _RARE_ he had spent on keeping it up . STO
* Ten years ago , he had come to the house to be _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ and the big pink _RARE_ had been _RARE_ along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing . STO
* Miss Ada had been out back , in a straw hat , _RARE_ flowers . STO
* She had talked to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which made him sweat and feel ashamed . STO
* Winston had been surprised at her for that . STO
* Still , he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress -- _RARE_ yellow , if he remembered . STO
* She had had a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan . STO
* Since then , the flowers she had _RARE_ had spread all over the hill . STO
* Already the _RARE_ were _RARE_ in a _RARE_ by the front gate , and the _RARE_ were coming on , blue by the porch steps . STO
* In a week the _RARE_ would _RARE_ out . STO
* And the _RARE_ in early May , for Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ party ; ; and after that the Japanese _RARE_ . STO
* Now the yard looked wet and _RARE_ , the trees bare under their _RARE_ , but in a while Miss _RARE_ flowers would _RARE_ like a marching parade . STO
* She had dug a hole for each bulb , each tree wore a _RARE_ with her writing on it ; ; where would she go for her _RARE_ now ? STO
* Somehow Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes . STO
* _RARE_ , he hurried to the living room . STO
* He had a thousand things to see to . STO
* Still , he couldn't help thinking , we're all getting old , getting small ; ; the _RARE_ is pulling in her _RARE_ . STO
* In the living room , Miss Ada was standing by the window with a _RARE_ of lists in her hand . STO
* She was looking out at the garden . STO
* `` Winston '' , she said , `` get the basket for the _RARE_ '' . STO
* Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall . STO
* He brought it in and put it down beside her . STO
* Miss Ada was looking fine ; ; she had on her _RARE_ suit , blue , with lavender binding . STO
* _RARE_ across the house , he could have smelled her morning perfume . STO
* It hung in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; ; sometimes when he was pressing , Winston raised her dresses to his face . STO
* _RARE_ , Miss Ada studied the list . STO
* `` Well , let's see . STO
* The china lemon tree . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* Winston followed her around the room , collecting the small frail objects ( Christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and _RARE_ them in tissue paper . STO
* Neither of them trusted the _RARE_ . STO
* When they came to Mr. Jack's photograph , twenty by twelve inches in a _RARE_ silver frame , Miss Ada said , `` By rights I ought to leave that , seeing he won't take my _RARE_ '' . STO
* She smiled at Winston , and he saw the _RARE_ hard _RARE_ in her eyes . STO
* He picked up the photograph and began to _RARE_ it . STO
* `` At least you could leave it for the _RARE_ '' , Miss Ada said . STO
* `` What possessed you to tell me a _RARE_ would be a good idea '' ? STO
* Winston folded the tissue paper carefully . STO
* `` He's used it every day ; ; every morning , I lay out his clothes on it '' . STO
* `` Well , that's over now . STO
* And it was his main present ! STO
* Leave that fool picture out '' , she added sharply . STO
* Winston laid it in the basket . STO
* `` Mr. Jack sets store by that '' . STO
* `` Really , Winston . STO
* It was meant to be my present '' . STO
* But she went on down the list . STO
* Winston was relieved ; ; those presents had been on his mind . STO
* He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the _RARE_ , but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack . STO
* `` You know what she likes , Winston '' , he had said wearily , one evening in November when Winston was pulling off his _RARE_ . STO
* `` Tell me what to get her for Christmas '' . STO
* `` She's been talking about a picture '' , Winston had told him . STO
* `` _RARE_ ! STO
* You mean picture of me '' ? STO
* But Winston had persuaded him . STO
* On Christmas night , they had had a _RARE_ about it . STO
* Winston had heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room . STO
* Through the door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada . STO
* Finally she had come down ; ; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown . STO
* `` How do you like it '' ? STO
* She had asked . STO
* Mr. Jack had said , `` You look about fifteen years old '' . STO
* `` Is that a _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` I don't know '' . STO
* He had stood at a little distance , studying her , as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head . STO
* `` _RARE_ , you make me feel naked '' . STO
* Miss Ada had _RARE_ , and she went _RARE_ and rustling to the couch and sank down . STO
* `` You look like that picture I have at the office '' , Mr. Jack had started . STO
* `` Not a line , not a _RARE_ . STO
* I look like an old man , compared '' , and he had picked up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on it . STO
* `` Look , an old man . STO
* Will you wear pink when you're sixty '' ? STO
* `` Darling , I love that photograph . STO
* I'm going to put it on my _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I guess it's children make a woman old . STO
* A man gets old anyhow '' . STO
* After a minute he went on , `` People must think the _RARE_ is on me , seeing you fresh as an _RARE_ and me old and gray '' . STO
* `` I'll give you a medical _RARE_ , framed , if you like '' , Miss Ada had said . STO
* `` No . STO
* All I want is a picture -- with a few lines . STO
* Make the man put them in if he has to '' . STO
* After that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word . STO
* Then Miss Ada had stood up , rustling and rustling , and gone upstairs . STO
* Was it love ? STO
* I had no doubt that it was . STO
* During the rest of the summer my _RARE_ _RARE_ for making plaster _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ of Catskill flowers and leaves was all but _RARE_ by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served up to me for _RARE_ and delight . STO
* Nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the _RARE_ of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the _RARE_ of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world . STO
* In final separation from them , in the railroad terminal across the river from New York , I would nearly cry . STO
* My _RARE_ _RARE_ arms would seem _RARE_ , inadequate , unwanted . STO
* But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had _RARE_ upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere _RARE_ or _RARE_ kitchen but by the immense obstacle of _RARE_ in _RARE_ distant _RARE_ , had agreed to _RARE_ . STO
* These letters became the center of my existence . STO
* I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to _RARE_ her letter for the _RARE_ time and finally prepare an answer . STO
* My memory has _RARE_ for easy reference and _RARE_ the image of her pink , scented _RARE_ and the _RARE_ , almost printed _RARE_ of her neat , _RARE_ _RARE_ with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when ; ; '' and others concerning camp friends who _RARE_ in her suburban neighborhood , , and news of her _RARE_ again her piano lessons , her private school , a visit to Boston to see her _RARE_ and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on _RARE_ , wounded , from the war in Europe . STO
* In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life . STO
* Then _RARE_ me was a foreign _RARE_ _RARE_ exciting _RARE_ and _RARE_ , full of _RARE_ and wit and _RARE_ , _RARE_ from the books I read , _RARE_ the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , _RARE_ class I was enrolled . STO
* The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ -- he of the porch steps _RARE_ -- who smoked cigarettes , performed the _RARE_ , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do _RARE_ things with them . STO
* Like _RARE_ , in my _RARE_ , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely _RARE_ , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my _RARE_ _RARE_ , would guide her gently to the night's _RARE_ which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost _RARE_ one another to death with deep , moist _RARE_ burning with love . STO
* The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle -- it must have been late in September -- I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The _RARE_ , nearly dying , my head _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life . STO
* For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie awake in shame , _RARE_ with _RARE_ , _RARE_ to fall into a deep sleep . STO
* The weeks went by , and the longer our separation grew , the more _RARE_ and almost unbearable my _RARE_ became . STO
* They caused my love for Jessica to become _RARE_ and at the same time more _RARE_ , as if my _RARE_ self knew that only _RARE_ would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again . STO
* As it turned out , Jessica took matters into her own hands . STO
* Having received permission to give a camp _RARE_ party , she asked that I come and be her date . STO
* I went and , _RARE_ and nervous , all but made a fool of myself . STO
* Again among those _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , I was shy with _RARE_ and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect , to be detached and _RARE_ with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom , later , in the privacy of our _RARE_ , we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance . STO
* I remember standing in a corner , watching Jessica act the hostess , serving soft drinks to her guests . STO
* She was wearing her dark hair in two , thick _RARE_ to attain an `` American _RARE_ '' effect she thought was appropriate to _RARE_ . STO
* It made her look sweet and _RARE_ , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it . STO
* Yet a moment did come that night when the _RARE_ letter writer and _RARE_ seemed to stride off my _RARE_ pages , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality . STO
* It was late , we were playing kissing games , and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of the others . STO
* We blushed and were _RARE_ , and it turned out to be the _RARE_ brush of lips upon cheek . STO
* The kiss _RARE_ our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting _RARE_ of _RARE_ , all the mysterious _RARE_ that I had imagined a truly _RARE_ kiss would _RARE_ to me . STO
* It was at that party that , finally overcoming my _RARE_ , _RARE_ by _RARE_ only _RARE_ and _RARE_ among older boys , I asked _RARE_ to spend New _RARE_ _RARE_ with me . STO
* _RARE_ , she accepted , and so great was my emotion that all I could think of saying was , `` You're amazing , you know '' ? STO
* Later , we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night . STO
* We would write to one another and make a definite plan . STO
* She was terribly pleased . STO
* Among my school and neighborhood friends , during the next months , I _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ described my _RARE_ date . STO
* But though I _RARE_ and gave off a _RARE_ front , I was beneath it all frightened . STO
* It would be the first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved . STO
* I had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl , or how one behaved : Should I hold her hand while walking or only when crossing the street ? STO
* Should I bring along a _RARE_ or send one to her ? STO
* Was it _RARE_ to meet her at home or in the city ? STO
* Should I accompany her to the door of her home , or should I ask to be invited in ? STO
* In or out , should I kiss her _RARE_ ? STO
* All this was unknown to me , and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year ! STO
* When in one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on New _RARE_ _RARE_ , I knew for a moment an immense relief ; ; but the letter went on : she had cried , she had _RARE_ , she had been miserable at his refusal , and finally he had _RARE_ -- and now how happy she was , how _RARE_ ! STO
* Her optimism gave me heart . STO
* I forced confidence into myself . STO
* I made inquiries , I read a book of _RARE_ . STO
* In December I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the Hotel _RARE_ , a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated . STO
* We would attend a film and , later on , I stated , we might go to the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ or _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* I set the hour of our meeting for seven . STO
* At five o'clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a _RARE_ . STO
* I wore a new _RARE_ brown _RARE_ suit with a faint _RARE_ design and wide _RARE_ like a _RARE_ ears . STO
* My _RARE_ leather _RARE_ , bulky with twisted , raised _RARE_ around the edges , I _RARE_ with money I had been saving . STO
* _RARE_ , in an overcoat of rough blue wool , I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father , and I set out into the _RARE_ still streets of Brooklyn . STO
* I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind , felt older than my years , and was full of _RARE_ for myself as I headed into the _RARE_ that was carrying its _RARE_ of _RARE_ out of that dull _RARE_ and into the unstable , _RARE_ excitement of Manhattan . STO
* Times Square , when I _RARE_ to it with my fellow _RARE_ _RARE_ ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ , with _RARE_ up _RARE_ and soldiers already hugging their girls and their _RARE_ bottles of whiskey . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ sat _RARE_ noble horses along the _RARE_ to prevent the _RARE_ from _RARE_ out in front of the crawling traffic . STO
* The night was cold but the crowd kept one warm . STO
* The giant electric signs and _RARE_ were lit up for the first time since _RARE_ regulations had been instituted , and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ for the _RARE_ tin models , were being _RARE_ and bought at _RARE_ stands every few yards along Broadway , and one's ears were continually _RARE_ by the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* An old gentlemen next to me held a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to his lips and _RARE_ away at every fourth step and during the _RARE_ shouted out , `` V for _RARE_ '' ! STO
* His neighbors _RARE_ him on . STO
* There was a great sense of _RARE_ . STO
* How did one join them ? STO
* Where were they all walking to ? STO
* Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a _RARE_ for Jessica ? STO
* It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other _RARE_ who had established the _RARE_ steps as the _RARE_ from which to _RARE_ their night of _RARE_ . STO
* I looked over their faces and felt a _RARE_ : they all looked so much more knowing than I . STO
* I looked away . STO
* I looked for Jessica to _RARE_ out of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ crowd and , as the time passed and I waited , a _RARE_ came to life beside me and whispered in my ear : How was I planning to _RARE_ Jessica ? STO
* Where exactly would we go after the movie ? STO
* Suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we couldn't get in ? STO
* Suppose I hadn't brought along enough money ? STO
* I felt for my _RARE_ . STO
* Its thick , substantial _RARE_ calmed me . STO
* But when I saw that it was already ten past seven , I began to wonder if something had gone wrong . STO
* Suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave ? STO
* Suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans ? STO
* I grew uneasy . STO
* All about me there was a _RARE_ interplay of meetings taking place , like abrupt , _RARE_ scenes in old silent movies , joyous _RARE_ and beginnings , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , enthusiastic _RARE_ into the _RARE_ night . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ were taking up new positions on the steps , arriving and _RARE_ , while I stayed glued , like a _RARE_ , to one spot . STO
* At _RARE_ two hotel _RARE_ came _RARE_ down the steps , carrying a _RARE_ to be set up as a _RARE_ in front of the _RARE_ store window next to the _RARE_ , and as I watched them in their _RARE_ red coats that nearly scraped the ground , their golden , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd . STO
* My heart almost stopped beating . STO
* There were _RARE_ patients on the bus the morning I left for Hanover , most of them disturbed and _RARE_ . STO
* An _RARE_ , a nurse and two _RARE_ were in charge of us . STO
* I felt lonely and depressed as I stared out the bus window at _RARE_ grim , dirty West _RARE_ . STO
* It seemed incredible , as I listened to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of voices and smelled the _RARE_ odors coming from the patients , that _RARE_ I was a ward of the state of Illinois , going to a hospital for the mentally ill . STO
* I suddenly thought of Mary Jane _RARE_ , the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger , her quiet competence , the _RARE_ and _RARE_ that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses . STO
* We had become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital . STO
* I had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the _RARE_ stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in Marshall Field & Co. . STO
* She knew that I lived at a good address on the _RARE_ Coast , that I had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies . STO
* She knew also that I was _RARE_ and without a single known relative . STO
* She wasn't quite sure that I felt enough _RARE_ about my drinking , or that I would not return to it once I was out and on my own again . STO
* This had worried her . STO
* `` I read those newspaper stories about you '' , she had said . STO
* `` You must have loved that girl very much , but you couldn't have meant it when you said that you wanted to kill her '' . STO
* `` Why do you say that '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` I was full of _RARE_ and , well , a drunk is apt to do anything he says he'll do '' . STO
* _RARE_ ! STO
* I grew up in an _RARE_ neighborhood on _RARE_ West _RARE_ . STO
* Don't tell me about _RARE_ . STO
* You're not the kind to go violent . STO
* _RARE_ you in love with that girl '' ? STO
* `` Would it make any difference to you if I were , Mary Jane '' ? STO
* She met my eyes , suddenly angry . STO
* `` I wouldn't have gone into nursing if I didn't care about people . STO
* I'm interested in every patient I've helped take care of . STO
* When I think of people like you , well , I '' -- `` You what , Mary Jane '' ? STO
* `` You are young , intelligent , have a whole _RARE_ before you to make something worth while of yourself , but you mess it up with whiskey , indifference , _RARE_ attitudes . STO
* I don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you . STO
* Was she pretty '' ? STO
* `` Oh , yes '' , I said , feeling annoyed , `` she was very pretty . STO
* You don't believe that I'm going back to medical school and finish , do you '' ? STO
* `` Why should I ? STO
* I've worked this ward for three months now . STO
* We keep getting the same ones back again and again . STO
* They all mean well , have great promises to make when they are about to go home , but drinking is their _RARE_ . STO
* You've not seemed like them , but maybe you are . STO
* You've treated your stay here like a big joke . STO
* It's not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover . STO
* I wanted to go to college , too '' -- `` Why didn't you '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` Chicago has some of the best '' -- Her eyes flashed angrily . STO
* `` That's what I mean about you , _RARE_ '' , she said . STO
* `` You don't seem to know much about reality . STO
* I'll tell you why I didn't go to college ; ; I'm the oldest of six children . STO
* My father's a policeman and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year . STO
* There was no money for _RARE_ , for clothes , for all the things you apparently take for granted . STO
* _RARE_ training here doesn't cost anything . STO
* They even pay me six dollars a month . STO
* I think it's a good deal . STO
* I'm going to become a good nurse , and I've got two baby brothers that are going to have college if I have to work at my profession until I'm an old maid to give it to them '' . STO
* `` Do you have a boy friend '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` That's none of your business '' , she said , then changed the subject . STO
* `` What about your father and mother , don't you think of them when you're in a place like this '' ? STO
* `` My father and mother died when I was two years old '' , I said . STO
* `` My _RARE_ raised me . STO
* Aunt Mary died when I was doing my military service . STO
* I have no one but myself to worry about '' . STO
* Something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly , and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face . STO
* `` I'm sorry '' , she said . STO
* `` I don't know what I'd do without my family . STO
* We've always been so close '' . STO
* `` Tell me more about them '' . STO
* Her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , cousins . STO
* _RARE_ , I felt _RARE_ and lonely as only an _RARE_ can . STO
* When she had finished I said : `` Your _RARE_ sounds like a good father and a good policeman . STO
* I'll bet he wouldn't be pleased if a _RARE_ like me were to ask his daughter for a date -- I mean , after I'm out of the hospital , a month or so from now '' . STO
* `` My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years . STO
* He's a pretty good judge of character , _RARE_ . STO
* I don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to be a _RARE_ in the future '' . STO
* `` What about you ? STO
* How would you feel about it if I were to ask you for a date when I get through at Hanover '' ? STO
* `` If I thought you were serious about going back to school , that you'd learned something from your experiences here and at Hanover -- well , I might consider such an offer . STO
* What about your that girl you were going to kill '' ? STO
* It suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary Jane _RARE_ should know the truth about me -- that I was not the confused , sick , _RARE_ person she believed me to be . STO
* `` There are things about me that I can't tell you now , Mary Jane '' , I said , `` but if you'll go out to dinner with me when I get out of Hanover , I'd like to tell you the whole story . STO
* I can say this : I'm dead serious about going back to school . STO
* As for that other girl , let's just say that I never want to see her again . STO
* You will get to come home on long _RARE_ from Hanover , won't you '' ? STO
* `` Yes , I'll get one overnight a month '' . STO
* `` We'll go up to the _RARE_ Beach Hotel for dinner '' , I said . STO
* `` Do you like to dance ? STO
* They always have a good orchestra '' . STO
* `` I like to dance '' , she said , then turned and walked away . STO
* There hadn't been anything really personal in her interest in me . STO
* I knew that . STO
* It was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there . STO
* Now , riding this hospital bus , feeling isolated and utterly alone , I knew that she was genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl I had known before . STO
* It seemed the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me . STO
* It was a fantastic story . STO
* Only two people in the state of Illinois knew that I was entering Hanover State Hospital under an assumed name , or why . STO
* It was unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary Jane _RARE_ would believe it without proof . STO
* But I had the proof , all _RARE_ in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free to do so . STO
* As the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes , thinking over the events of the past two weeks , trying to put the pieces in order . STO
* I wondered suddenly as I listened to the _RARE_ _RARE_ coming from the patient behind me , if I had not perhaps imagined it all . STO
* Perhaps this was reality and _RARE_ Nelson , the actor , was _RARE_ ; ; a _RARE_ of Carl _RARE_ imagination . STO
* Four I had come to Chicago from New York early in September with a dramatic production called _RARE_ Tony . STO
* It was a bad play , real _RARE_ _RARE_ , which only a _RARE_ of angels with _RARE_ dreams of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into _RARE_ . STO
* No one , not even the producer , had any real hope of getting it back to Broadway . STO
* But because it was a suspense _RARE_ story of the _RARE_ era , many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in Chicago , continue as a road company , and eventually become a movie . STO
* Such optimism was completely _RARE_ . STO
* The critics literally screamed their indignation . STO
* _RARE_ Tony was _RARE_ from the moment _RARE_ leveled on it in his _RARE_ column . STO
* We opened on Friday and closed the following Monday . STO
* Out of the entire cast I alone received good notices for my _RARE_ of a _RARE_ killer . STO
* This let me in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company , two members of which were native _RARE_ . STO
* We were paid off Tuesday morning and given tickets back to New York . STO
* I felt lonely and depressed as I packed my bags at the _RARE_ Hotel . STO
* It seemed to me that my life was _RARE_ to be one brilliant failure after another . STO
* I had been among the top third in my class at _RARE_ , had wanted desperately to go to medical school , but I'd run out of money and energy at the same time . STO
* Then later I had quit my safe , secure _RARE_ spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play . STO
* It seemed to me that I was not only _RARE_ but quite stupid as well . STO
* I knew that I'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a _RARE_ at Union News or _RARE_ while waiting for another acting job to open . STO
* It suddenly occurred to me that I did not particularly like acting , that I was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I was going to do with my life . STO
* I closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the _RARE_ to pick up , then went to the bathroom for a drink of water . STO
* The telephone rang . STO
* When I answered it a voice too dignified and British to be real said , `` Is this Mr. _RARE_ Nelson , the actor '' ? STO
* `` All right '' , I said . STO
* `` Why don't you bastards lay off for a while '' ? STO
* `` I beg your pardon , sir '' ? STO
* `` All right . STO
* This is _RARE_ Nelson the actor '' . STO
* `` Good . STO
* I'm calling you , Mr. Nelson , at the request of Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Could you possibly have lunch with him today ? STO
* His car could pick you up at your hotel at twelve '' . STO
* I smiled . STO
* `` You'll send the _RARE_ , of course '' ? STO
* `` Yes , of course , Mr. Nelson '' . STO
* I started to say something else appropriate , but the man had hung up . STO
* I finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were _RARE_ their _RARE_ over the _RARE_ passing of _RARE_ Tony . STO
* They all bowed low as I approached them . STO
* `` All right , you bastards '' , I said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink '' . STO
* I laid a _RARE_ on the bar and _RARE_ to the bartender to serve a round . STO
* He had just returned my change when the _RARE_ came in off the street to page me . STO
* I walked over to him . STO
* `` You Mr. Nelson '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` That's right '' . STO
* `` Mr. _RARE_ car is waiting for you at the east entrance '' . STO
* I followed him out through the lobby to the street . STO
* An ancient _RARE_ , as _RARE_ impressive as the day it came off the ship , was parked at the curb . STO
* The elderly _RARE_ , _RARE_ in a dark uniform , stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of the town car . STO
* I was giving the parked cars the _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ with the license number _RARE_ _RARE_ was in stall number five . STO
* `` Okay '' , I said to the attendant , `` I'll let you know if I close the deal on the office in this building '' . STO
* I walked with him back to the entrance . STO
* He gave me a ticket on the agency car and parked it . STO
* I was back in ten minutes . STO
* `` _RARE_ to get something out of the car '' , I told him , showing him my ticket . STO
* He started to say something as I walked in and then suddenly grinned and said , `` Oh , yes . STO
* You're the one I was talking to about a monthly _RARE_ . STO
* `` That's right '' , I told him . STO
* He consulted the parking ticket , then looked at a _RARE_ and said , `` You're in the third row back toward the rear . STO
* Can you find it all right '' ? STO
* `` Sure '' , I told him . STO
* I went back to the agency car and got out an electric _RARE_ , one of the _RARE_ devices for electronic _RARE_ . STO
* I always keep a set in the car . STO
* I put in new _RARE_ so as to be certain I'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking _RARE_ and stood looking at them thoughtfully . STO
* I waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer , then slipped around the back of the car with license number _RARE_ _RARE_ , attached the electronic _RARE_ to the rear _RARE_ and walked out . STO
* The attendant waved me on . STO
* One of the hardest _RARE_ a detective has is hanging around on a city street , trying to make himself _RARE_ , keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting . STO
* For the first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window _RARE_ , then in people passing by . STO
* After a while , however , a _RARE_ mind gets fed up and that _RARE_ all of the _RARE_ physical symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment . STO
* You want to sit down . STO
* Your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary . STO
* You're conscious of the fact that your feet hurt , that the city _RARE_ are hard . STO
* I waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building . STO
* He came out alone . STO
* I wasn't far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car . STO
* The attendant recognized me once more and said , `` What did you do about that office '' ? STO
* `` I haven't made up my mind yet '' , I said . STO
* `` It's a _RARE_ . STO
* I have a couple of them I'm _RARE_ on ; ; one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb parking '' . STO
* `` That curb parking is _RARE_ and _RARE_ , particularly when it _RARE_ '' , he said . STO
* I kept trying to get him to take my money . STO
* `` Okay '' , I told him . STO
* `` I'm in a rush right now . STO
* I know where the car is . STO
* _RARE_ me to drive it out '' ? STO
* `` I'll have one of the boys get it '' , he said . STO
* `` It's one of the rules on _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ drive out their own cars '' . STO
* `` Make it as _RARE_ as you can , will you '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` Oh , that's all right '' , he said . STO
* `` You're going to be a regular . STO
* You'll get in the office building here . STO
* You don't want to _RARE_ a place way out in the sticks . STO
* You get business where the business is , not where it isn't '' . STO
* I grinned at him , handed him a couple of dollars and said , `` By the time you get the parking charge figured up , there should be a cigar in it for you '' . STO
* I hurried over to the agency heap , jumped in , started the motor and was just in time to see the car I wanted to shadow turn to the left . STO
* I was held up a bit trying to make a left turn . STO
* By the time I'd made it he was gone . STO
* _RARE_ was pretty heavy . STO
* I turned on the electric _RARE_ , and the signal came in loud and clear . STO
* I made time and picked him up within ten blocks . STO
* I stayed half a block behind him , letting lots of cars keep in between us , listening to the steady _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* After fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left . STO
* I couldn't see him , but the electric _RARE_ device gave steady _RARE_ when it was straight ahead , short half _RARE_ when the car I was following was to the left , and long _RARE_ _RARE_ when it turned to the right . STO
* If it ever got behind me , the _RARE_ turned to a _RARE_ . STO
* I turned left too soon and got a signal showing that I was still behind him but he was to the right . STO
* After a while the signal became a _RARE_ and I knew he was behind me . STO
* That meant he'd parked _RARE_ . STO
* I made a big circle until I located the car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house . STO
* I found a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited . STO
* My quarry was in the apartment house for two hours . STO
* Then he came out and started driving toward the beach . STO
* By this time it was dark . STO
* I could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there wasn't traffic . STO
* My lights would have been a _RARE_ if I'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner . STO
* Moreover , I'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic _RARE_ device . STO
* His signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a _RARE_ . STO
* I circled the block and found he was in the parking lot of a _RARE_ restaurant . STO
* I sat where I could watch the exit and realized I was hungry . STO
* I sat there with the faint odor of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ my _RARE_ and occasionally _RARE_ the _RARE_ of coffee . STO
* My man came out an hour later , drove to the beach , turned right and after half a mile went to the _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front . STO
* I remembered it was the _RARE_ Tom place . STO
* I waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before I went in to register . STO
* The card the man I was _RARE_ had filled out was still on the counter . STO
* I noticed that he was in Unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of _RARE_ L. _RARE_ and wife , giving a San Francisco address . STO
* He had written out the license number of his car but had _RARE_ the last two figures , an old _RARE_ which is still good . STO
* _RARE_ times out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't check the license number on the plates against the license number the _RARE_ _RARE_ out . STO
* If he does , it's still better than an even chance he won't notice the _RARE_ of the numbers , and if he should notice it , the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake . STO
* I used the _RARE_ of Robert C. _RARE_ , gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap , but a couple of phony numbers in between . STO
* I could have written anything . STO
* The manager of the motel was a woman who apparently didn't care . STO
* She was _RARE_ with the law in regard to _RARE_ but she certainly wasn't _RARE_ license numbers or bothering the tenants . STO
* `` You mean you're all alone , Mr. _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` That's right '' . STO
* `` Your wife isn't going to join you -- later '' ? STO
* `` I don't think so '' . STO
* `` If you expect her to show up '' , she said , `` you'd better put ' and wife ' on there . STO
* It's a _RARE_ , you know '' . STO
* `` Any difference in the rate '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` Not to you '' , she said smiling . STO
* `` It's ten dollars either way . STO
* There are ice _RARE_ in a container at the far end and in another by the office . STO
* There are three _RARE_ _RARE_ machines , and if you should be joined by -- anybody -- try to keep things quiet , if you will . STO
* We like to run a nice quiet place '' . STO
* `` Thank you '' , I told her . STO
* I took another _RARE_ glance at the other registration card , then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car . STO
* The construction was reasonably solid ; ; not like the _RARE_ construction of so many of the motel units that have _RARE_ all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the _RARE_ apartment . STO
* I put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side I wanted to case . STO
* With the aid of that I could hear my man moving around , heard him cough a couple of times , heard the toilet flush , heard the sound of water running . STO
* Whoever his companion was going to be , she was going to join him later . STO
* She knew where to come . STO
* He didn't have to telephone . STO
* I was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed . STO
* It's one thing to go without food when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply _RARE_ a meal , but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you can't eat until he's _RARE_ down for the night , hunger can be a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I had noticed a _RARE_ down the road a quarter of a mile . STO
* The _RARE_ on the _RARE_ device I had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals . STO
* The powerful _RARE_ I could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation , and I was positively _RARE_ I was so hungry . STO
* I got in the car , drove down to the _RARE_ and ordered a couple of _RARE_ with everything included , a cup of coffee and the _RARE_ service possible . STO
* The place wasn't particularly busy at that time of night , and the girl who was waiting on me , who was _RARE_ in the _RARE_ pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was -- and there was lots of it -- wanted to be _RARE_ . STO
* `` You really in a hurry , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She asked . STO
* `` I'm in a hurry , _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` It's early in the evening to be in a hurry . STO
* There's lots of time left '' . STO
* `` There may not be any women left '' , I said . STO
* She gave a little _RARE_ and said , `` I don't get off work until eleven o'clock . STO
* That's when my evening _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I'll be here at _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* `` Oh , you ! STO
* '' She announced . STO
* `` That's what they all say . STO
* What's that thing going _RARE_ in your car '' ? STO
* I said `` _RARE_ it , that's the automatic signal that shows when the _RARE_ key is on . STO
* I didn't turn it off '' . STO
* I reached over and switched off the electronic _RARE_ device . STO
* She went in to get the _RARE_ , and I switched on the device again and kept the signal from _RARE_ car coming in steady and clear until I saw her starting back with the _RARE_ . STO
* Then I shut off the device again . STO
* She wanted to hang around while I was eating . STO
* `` Don't you think it's _RARE_ to have dinner before you go to pick her up '' ? STO
* `` No '' , I said . STO
* `` It's a _RARE_ to her . STO
* You see , she's on a diet . STO
* She'll eat just a _RARE_ and cottage cheese _RARE_ and I'm to have one with her so she won't feel out of place '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ can be terrible '' , the girl said . STO
* `` How much _RARE_ is she '' ? STO
* `` Not a bit '' , I said , `` but she's keeping her figure in hand '' . STO
* She looked at me _RARE_ . STO
* `` Good figures should be kept in hand '' , she said , and walked away with an exaggerated _RARE_ . STO
* I turned on the device again , half _RARE_ that I might find silence , but the _RARE_ came in loud and clear . STO
* When I switched on the lights for her to come and get the check , I had the exact change plus a dollar tip . STO
* The fat man said , `` All we _RARE_ do is go around the corner '' . STO
* The gun moved . STO
* The thin man said , `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` -- second building on the right '' . STO
* `` -- it says police right on the door '' . STO
* `` -- so even if we was as dumb as you take us for , we could still find it '' . STO
* Roberta and Dave began to back toward the door . STO
* The thin man waved the gun again . STO
* He said , `` Right around the corner '' . STO
* `` It says water works , but there is a policeman on duty , too '' . STO
* `` A night policeman just like in the States . STO
* You know '' ? STO
* `` Canada doesn't have much of this here _RARE_ _RARE_ problem , but we keep a night policeman all the same on account of the crazy tourists '' . STO
* At the door , Dave paused to feel for the _RARE_ . STO
* Roberta glanced up at her husband . STO
* He was going to be sensible and not try to do anything _RARE_ with that gun pointed at him . STO
* She measured the distance from where they stood to the men and the gun , measured the distance from the men to the back room . STO
* She decided to risk it . STO
* There was something phony about all this gun waving -- something not quite what it seemed in the detailed directions for finding the police . STO
* Dave had the _RARE_ under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open . STO
* In a flash she was away to the back , paying no attention to three angry shouts from the male _RARE_ . STO
* She tore open the back door . STO
* It was dark inside the room but enough light _RARE_ from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top . STO
* There was a small _RARE_ with some empty beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs . STO
* Slowly she turned to face the men again . STO
* _RARE_ at the counter was on his feet . STO
* The distance between where she stood and where Dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles . STO
* _RARE_ her frightened gaze on the men at the counter , she began to feel her way to the door . STO
* She _RARE_ along the _RARE_ one step at a time . STO
* The gun followed her . STO
* As she reached Dave and felt his arm go around her , felt him pull her to the safety of his person , she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to Lauren . STO
* The two men watched as Dave closed the door behind them , watched them cross the sidewalk to their car . STO
* It was getting light . STO
* The fat man removed his apron , put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket , and _RARE_ it over his _RARE_ . STO
* The thin man moved swiftly to the phone and _RARE_ a number . STO
* When he was answered , he said , `` Albert ? STO
* Vince . STO
* I'm sending you a couple of customers -- yeah -- just get them out of my hair and keep them out -- I don't give a damn what you tell them -- only don't believe a word they say -- they're out to make trouble for me and it is up to you to stop them -- I don't care how -- and one more thing -- _RARE_ _RARE_ closed at eleven like always last night and Rose and _RARE_ _RARE_ left for _RARE_ yesterday -- some _RARE_ or other -- I think it was called Saint _RARE_ -- yeah , yesterday . STO
* Got it '' ? STO
* He turned from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant . STO
* The white _RARE_ hadn't moved away yet . STO
* Good . STO
* A line of worry formed , a _RARE_ pulled his mouth over to one side . STO
* He said , `` Grosse ? STO
* You ain't kidding me -- the kid don't know the name of this town '' ? STO
* `` I ain't kidding you , Vince . STO
* How could she ? STO
* She _RARE_ been walking in her sleep -- you seen her yourself in here '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ I know '' ? STO
* `` Remember how she looked when Barney held the door for her ? STO
* _RARE_ like a _RARE_ ? STO
* She was just waking up when we found her at the garage '' . STO
* Vince swore . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ -- ain't got enough brains between the two of you '' -- Grosse muttered , his head down , one hand playing with the _RARE_ on his jacket . STO
* `` -- had enough brains to call _RARE_ up so as _RARE_ could do _RARE_ about it when the parents -- I _RARE_ let her go go '' -- His eyes were lowered , so he couldn't have seen the narrow , pointed face of his companion suddenly _RARE_ with fury ; ; but he was aware of it just the same . STO
* He knew Vince _RARE_ was one of those men who had to work up a fury once in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be . STO
* With a _RARE_ , Vince seized the thing nearest , a glass sugar container with a _RARE_ metal top , and threw it against the wall opposite . STO
* The heavy glass didn't break , but the top flew off ; ; sugar _RARE_ with a _RARE_ that was loud in the silence . STO
* Not really startled , but careful to appear so , Grosse sucked _RARE_ on his pipe . STO
* Vince cursed steadily . STO
* `` Why does everything have to happen to me '' ? STO
* Grosse quietly got a _RARE_ and started to sweep up the sugar . STO
* Vince watched him . STO
* His mouth worked over the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ in his vocabulary . STO
* Once he said , `` _RARE_ hell didn't you look in the back seat of the car before you drove off ? STO
* Don't you and Barney ever use your brains '' ? STO
* The fat man didn't answer . STO
* He got one of the _RARE_ and brushed the _RARE_ sugar onto it and carried it to a box on the floor behind the counter . STO
* He returned the _RARE_ to its place between _RARE_ bottle and paper _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He spoke _RARE_ . STO
* `` She don't know nothing about them cars . STO
* She thinks she's in a ordinary garage '' . STO
* `` How do you know , stupid ? STO
* And put _RARE_ gun back '' . STO
* `` I know '' . STO
* Grosse _RARE_ the gun under the counter . STO
* `` -- one word of this gets to _RARE_ '' -- `` Who's telling _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Vince swore again . STO
* `` You get that kid over to _RARE_ house '' . STO
* The fat man _RARE_ . STO
* He ran a finger down his cheek , tracing the scratch there . STO
* `` Why can't I leave her locked up in the tool crib '' ? STO
* The thin man stopped his _RARE_ long enough to glance at the clock . STO
* `` You and Barney get her over to _RARE_ before it gets too light . STO
* After _RARE_ left , we'll _RARE_ the kid somewhere near the _RARE_ where she _RARE_ get home . STO
* God help you if she knows where she's been '' . STO
* Grosse spread his hands . STO
* `` What am I going to do with her all day ? STO
* In the tool crib she can't get away '' . STO
* `` What the hell do I care what you do with her all day ? STO
* Just get her where _RARE_ won't see her and start asking questions '' . STO
* Grosse swore now . STO
* `` _RARE_ all , Vince . STO
* I ain't no baby _RARE_ '' . STO
* Vince shouted finally , `` Get her over to _RARE_ and I'll come by and see that she _RARE_ put '' . STO
* Grosse rubbed the bridge of his nose where it was swollen . STO
* He spoke _RARE_ . STO
* `` You don't _RARE_ get _RARE_ . STO
* I wish you luck when you try _RARE_ that kid '' . STO
* Suddenly he grinned . STO
* His voice lost its sullen tones and he chuckled . STO
* `` I got one question '' . STO
* `` What is it '' ? STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* `` Are you a poor dumb _RARE_ or a smart _RARE_ from the States '' ? STO
* Vince lifted his hand as if to strike , but his thin lips spread in a smile . STO
* Grosse _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ you say you was born '' ? STO
* `` In a Chicago _RARE_ just like you . STO
* And I ain't going back there on account of one lousy kid '' . STO
* Lauren _RARE_ rubbed her face against the blanket . STO
* She had cried a little because she was frightened . STO
* She could easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car ( she had figured that out ) , but she couldn't understand their subsequent actions . STO
* Was it because she had shown panic ? STO
* Who could blame her for that ? STO
* It was one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had gone on home without you . STO
* She was glad the fat man had left . STO
* Barney was not really _RARE_ . STO
* She jumped as the little man now appeared at the window and , reaching through the opening , offered her a bottle of _RARE_ . STO
* She smiled at him _RARE_ . STO
* Although she found she was _RARE_ , she was about to refuse ( never , never take _RARE_ from a strange man ) when she saw the bottle was _RARE_ . STO
* He placed a bottle _RARE_ on the counter . STO
* So , he understood her panic . STO
* She blew her nose on a tissue and opened the _RARE_ bottle . STO
* It was icy cold and tasted _RARE_ . STO
* She felt a lift in spirit . STO
* When she was finished she pushed it back . STO
* The man was busy doing something to the inside of the _RARE_ on the driver's side of a car . STO
* She called softly , `` Barney '' . STO
* He looked in her direction but he didn't answer . STO
* She said , `` Barney , why is he keeping me here '' ? STO
* Still no answer . STO
* He seemed to be looking at a point above the little window . STO
* Lauren said , `` Why can't I call my home ? STO
* Or _RARE_ some money from someone and go home by bus ? STO
* I could send the money right back '' . STO
* Barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking . STO
* He dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe . STO
* Now he looked at her . STO
* He said , `` I only work here '' . STO
* Lauren said , `` Please '' ? STO
* But he was back at work on a car . STO
* She dropped her head on her arms on the counter . STO
* How could he be kind one moment and cruel the next ? STO
* Did he know something that made him feel sad and sorry for her ? STO
* And was he afraid to do anything as definite as _RARE_ her ? STO
* Her heart was _RARE_ painfully ; ; the unknown was so much worse than -- what dangers lay ahead for her ? STO
* What awful thing had she to face in the next few hours ? STO
* Something wet and hot was _RARE_ on her wrists . STO
* _RARE_ ? STO
* With a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself ; ; as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation she was in , she would think about something else . STO
* Her mother and father , for instance . STO
* Where were they now ? STO
* In her mind she followed the white _RARE_ along the road somewhere between here and the _RARE_ River . STO
* Her father's attention would be on the road ahead and it wouldn't _RARE_ an inch until he crossed the bridge at the _RARE_ and took the River Road to _RARE_ and , finally , turned in at their own driveway at _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Then he would _RARE_ and stretch and shout , `` All out . STO
* This is the end of the line '' . STO
* And what would her mother be doing right now ? STO
* Her mother would be fast asleep curled up against that wonderful , big , safe , solid shoulder next to her on the front seat . STO
* Lauren _RARE_ was in trouble and she was alone . STO
* Roberta _RARE_ put her hand on her husband's arm as he slid in the driver's seat beside her . STO
* Somewhere birds were sweetly calling , were answered . STO
* Her teeth _RARE_ so that she made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible . STO
* `` Dave . STO
* I saw that woman's apron behind the door . STO
* There was a wet spot -- she couldn't have been gone long '' . STO
* Dave made some sound meant to _RARE_ agreement . STO
* He inserted the car key in the lock . STO
* Roberta was violently trembling . STO
* She _RARE_ , `` You heard what he said about police ? STO
* Why don't we drive around the corner '' ? STO
* The car door crashed shut . STO
* The engine _RARE_ into life . STO
* Dave said , `` I got the message . STO
* We're going '' . STO
* Roberta said , `` no . STO
* You go . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Suppose Lauren comes looking for us ? STO
* I can sit here in the car while you walk around the corner '' . STO
* The big car sprang away from the curb like something alive . STO
* He said , `` I'm not going to leave my wife and my car out here in sight of those '' -- Roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling . STO
* His _RARE_ were _RARE_ by _RARE_ of _RARE_ beard . STO
* His small , mean eyes regarded Marty steadily , _RARE_ . STO
* His eyes were _RARE_ by little _RARE_ of red as if tiny veins had burst and _RARE_ blood into them . STO
* As he _RARE_ his _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ breath , Marty _RARE_ the _RARE_ of bad whiskey . STO
* Marty recognized the man . STO
* He had driven the car that passed them on the road outside _RARE_ place . STO
* This was _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ joint . STO
* Marty smiled at _RARE_ pleasantly and said , `` There was a cab waiting for me here . STO
* Do you know where it might have gone '' ? STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ his _RARE_ , his jaw moving in a steady rhythm . STO
* He looked straight at Marty . STO
* He did not answer . STO
* Marty scanned the faces of the others nearest him , looked into their staring eyes . STO
* `` Did anyone see my cab '' ? STO
* He asked , keeping his voice casual . STO
* He avoided showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him . STO
* `` I have to get back to Jarrodsville '' , he went on . STO
* `` I see there are some cars here . STO
* I wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town ? STO
* I'd be happy to pay for the favor , of course '' . STO
* The seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer . STO
* And then a startling thing occurred . STO
* It was so utterly unexpected that Marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open _RARE_ after it had happened . STO
* There was no word spoken , no apparent signal given . STO
* Yet the men all moved at the same instant . STO
* They piled into the waiting cars , _RARE_ roared , the cars sped off . STO
* The station wagon and the old Plymouth headed east toward Jarrodsville . STO
* The Ford and the pickup truck sped west toward _RARE_ Run . STO
* In seconds all four cars were out of sight . STO
* Marty Land stood alone on a _RARE_ road as storm clouds gathered _RARE_ in the sky again . STO
* From a great distance thunder _RARE_ and broke the silence . STO
* Land looked back toward the _RARE_ house . STO
* He thought he saw a pale face at a window . STO
* Perhaps it was _RARE_ May . STO
* Perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him . STO
* There were other _RARE_ nearby . STO
* _RARE_ the road there was one no more than a hundred yards away . STO
* There was another on this side , a little further down . STO
* There were many more between here and Jarrodsville . STO
* Telephone _RARE_ lined the road . STO
* They reared tall and _RARE_ . STO
* Their wires stretched out into _RARE_ . STO
* Not a single _RARE_ of wire reached into the silent houses beside the _RARE_ road . STO
* There was nothing he could do but walk . STO
* And Jarrodsville was more than three miles away , down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a _RARE_ . STO
* Marty faced east and started walking down the left side of the road . STO
* After he had proceeded a few feet , he paused and turned up the _RARE_ of his trousers , which were already damp and _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ mud was _RARE_ , and in places great _RARE_ spread across the road and reflected the _RARE_ light . STO
* As he approached the first farmhouse , thunder sounded behind him again , closer now and louder , like a steadily _RARE_ _RARE_ corps . STO
* There were several people on the porch of the farmhouse . STO
* There was a very old man and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* For just an instant he thought of _RARE_ to them for help . STO
* Perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town . STO
* Then he realized the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the idea . STO
* They were staring at him in the same blank and _RARE_ way that the men outside the gate had stared . STO
* Even the eyes of the smallest children seemed _RARE_ . STO
* On his side of the road there were two farm hands , well back in a field , leaning against a plow . STO
* They , too , stared at him . STO
* The _RARE_ of thunder were right behind him now . STO
* A foolish thought came into his head . STO
* He remembered a story he had read as a youth . STO
* It was probably one of _RARE_ _RARE_ of the British Army . STO
* It concerned an officer who had been _RARE_ and _RARE_ out . STO
* The steady roll of the _RARE_ had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded , and each man _RARE_ and turned his back as the officer approached . STO
* Marty wished these poor farm people would turn their backs . STO
* The _RARE_ by the _RARE_ ended . STO
* Now the dirt highway was _RARE_ on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch , too broad to leap over unless you were an _RARE_ star . STO
* The day's rain had been added to the _RARE_ water . STO
* He was trapped on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car . STO
* It was coming toward him . STO
* The car was now in sight . STO
* _RARE_ heart skipped a beat when he recognized it . STO
* It was the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road , the station wagon that had been parked at the _RARE_ farm . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ station wagon . STO
* It had headed back toward Jarrodsville . STO
* That had only been a _RARE_ to _RARE_ him out on the deserted road . STO
* Now _RARE_ and his friends were returning to seek him out . STO
* The station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of him , beside a _RARE_ field . STO
* Then there was another sound . STO
* A second car was coming from the west , from the direction of _RARE_ Run . STO
* It was the Ford that had been outside _RARE_ farm . STO
* Marty looked _RARE_ in both directions . STO
* It was a narrow road , barely wide enough for two cars to pass . STO
* He could not leave the road because of the _RARE_ drainage ditch . STO
* When the two cars were _RARE_ from him , the station wagon started up again and the Ford gathered speed . STO
* They bore down on him . STO
* There was nothing he could do except jump into the ditch . STO
* He jumped , and sank to his knees in muddy water . STO
* As the two cars roared by , there was a high-pitched _RARE_ , _RARE_ sound . STO
* Marty knew how the Union soldiers must have felt at _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ when the ragged gray ranks charged at them , screaming the wild _RARE_ _RARE_ they called the Rebel yell . STO
* For moments he stood in water , shivering and gasping for breath . STO
* He had turned his ankle slightly , and it _RARE_ him . STO
* The cars , with their load of _RARE_ men , had disappeared in the distance . STO
* There had been two more cars parked at the farm , a Plymouth and a pickup truck . STO
* They would be coming for him next , bearing down on him from both directions . STO
* And then the station wagon and the Ford would seek him out again . STO
* He would be _RARE_ repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time , all the way to Jarrodsville . STO
* He still had three miles to go . STO
* Back East the more _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , who could afford _RARE_ _RARE_ instead of switch _RARE_ as _RARE_ weapons , played this same game and called it `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* He could not go through the fields . STO
* That way was _RARE_ on both sides of the road by a high _RARE_ fence . STO
* He had to make for the section of road just ahead that was _RARE_ by the rail fence , the section by the farmhouse . STO
* At least he could climb up on the fence when his _RARE_ roared by again . STO
* The _RARE_ place could not be far now . STO
* He would go in there , climb through the window , and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest . STO
* There was even a bare chance that the phone had not been _RARE_ . STO
* He did not dare climb back up to the road . STO
* He was deep in water , but at least they could not reach him there . STO
* He _RARE_ on , mud sucking at his feet with each step , until he reached the end of the drainage ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm . STO
* He climbed back to the road , and he felt utterly exhausted . STO
* He stood , panting , for a moment . STO
* And then he saw something that he had not seen before , and panic gripped him again . STO
* The fence , his only _RARE_ when the metal death came _RARE_ at him , was made of rails , all right , but the rails were protected by a thick _RARE_ of barbed wire that would _RARE_ his flesh if he pressed against it . STO
* He lurched on down the road _RARE_ , because there was no place else to go . STO
* He lost all sense of dignity . STO
* You could not stand on dignity when you were soaked and _RARE_ and your life was at stake . STO
* Probably people were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse , too , but he did not bother to look . STO
* He broke into a _RARE_ , breathing heavily , streaming with sweat . STO
* He had to reach _RARE_ place . STO
* It was his only _RARE_ . STO
* The fences on both sides of the road _RARE_ with the barbed wire . STO
* The fences stretched on _RARE_ . STO
* And then he heard them . STO
* And now he saw them . STO
* The Plymouth was coming at him from the east , the pickup truck from the west . STO
* They had timed it better this time . STO
* They would reach him at almost exactly the same instant . STO
* He stopped _RARE_ . STO
* If he backed against the fence , one of the cars would brush him as it passed , and he would be _RARE_ _RARE_ by the wire . STO
* He stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there , waiting for them , a perfect target . STO
* The cars must have had their gas _RARE_ pushed down to the floor boards . STO
* They were coming on at _RARE_ speed for such old vehicles . STO
* They _RARE_ at him . STO
* He held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible . STO
* When the Plymouth _RARE_ , it _RARE_ toward him and seemed about to run him down . STO
* He forced himself to stay frozen there . STO
* If he moved , he would be in the path of the other car . STO
* He thought the _RARE_ of the Plymouth brushed his jacket as it went by . STO
* In a fraction of a second the pickup truck _RARE_ by on the other side . STO
* The _RARE_ , insane sound of the Rebel yell _RARE_ again and echoed from the distant hills . STO
* He did not leave the middle of the road . STO
* He did not try to run . STO
* He _RARE_ on , his _RARE_ eyes focused straight ahead . STO
* He was nearing the _RARE_ house . STO
* He was going to make it , he told himself . STO
* And then he heard a car coming from the east , and he felt as if he would break down and weep . STO
* `` Oh , no , not again '' , he said aloud . STO
* `` Not again so soon '' . STO
* There was a new sound , a sound as _RARE_ as the Rebel yell , yet different . STO
* It was the sound of a _RARE_ . STO
* Now he saw that the approaching car was painted white , and he began to wave his arms frantically . STO
* It was the _RARE_ car from the _RARE_ office . STO
* The car drew up alongside him and stopped . STO
* `` Get in '' , _RARE_ _RARE_ said _RARE_ . STO
* He staggered into the back seat and lay back , fighting for breath . STO
* There was someone in front with the sheriff . STO
* It was Pete _RARE_ , the _RARE_ . STO
* Pete turned around and said to Marty , `` I guess you think I'm a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But there wasn't no use in me staying there . STO
* I couldn't fight a dozen or so of 'em . STO
* If I'd stayed , all that I'd have got was four _RARE_ tires and one _RARE_ head . STO
* Why didn't you wait at the _RARE_ house ? STO
* You _RARE_ known I'd gone to get the sheriff . STO
* I was lucky they let me go , I guess '' . STO
* The sheriff was occupied with _RARE_ the car around in a very narrow space . STO
* When it was finally pointed east , he said , `` You should never have come out here alone . STO
* This is _RARE_ country . STO
* Every man in every one of these houses is a Night _RARE_ . STO
* Then he turned the telephone over to Rourke , and went into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes . STO
* Rourke was talking on the phone when he came back . STO
* `` About an hour , _RARE_ ? STO
* Are you positive '' ? STO
* He listened a moment and then said , `` Hold it '' . STO
* He turned his head and said , `` _RARE_ will definitely be in a back room at the _RARE_ _RARE_ Club on South Beach within an hour . STO
* _RARE_ to try and meet him there '' ? STO
* Shayne looked at his watch . STO
* That wasn't too far from Fifth Street , and should allow him to make Scotty's Bar by midnight . STO
* He said with satisfaction , `` That's fine , Tim . STO
* I'll be there '' . STO
* Rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung up . STO
* `` I don't know what you're getting into , Mike '' , he said _RARE_ . STO
* `` I hope to Christ . STO
* '' Shayne said _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ another drink if you want it . STO
* We've got one other call to make before I meet _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Where '' ? STO
* `` It's out in the _RARE_ section . STO
* Have you got my car here '' ? STO
* `` It's parked in front '' . STO
* Rourke hastily _RARE_ whiskey into his glass on top of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` I'd better keep on driving yours '' , Shayne decided , `` because I'll be going on over to the Beach . STO
* I can drop you back here to pick mine up '' . STO
* He went to a closet to get a light jacket , and took his hat from beside the door . STO
* _RARE_ Rourke _RARE_ down the whiskey hastily and joined him , asking , `` Who are we going to call on in the _RARE_ section '' ? STO
* `` A lady . STO
* That is , maybe not too much of a lady . STO
* At least , I want to find out whether she's home yet or not '' . STO
* He opened the door and followed Rourke out . STO
* In _RARE_ car , Shayne drove east to _RARE_ Boulevard and north toward _RARE_ _RARE_ address which had been given to him by the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* As he drove , he filled in _RARE_ Rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the _RARE_ house , and on his own _RARE_ . STO
* `` I want to be in Scotty's Bar at midnight when _RARE_ makes her phone call there '' , he ended grimly . STO
* `` I don't know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not , but I want to see who takes the call '' . STO
* `` This deal at _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ where the two _RARE_ jumped you '' , said Rourke with interest , `` that sounds like it was set up with _RARE_ _RARE_ by the _RARE_ Mrs. _RARE_ , doesn't it '' ? STO
* `` It does '' , Shayne grunted _RARE_ , still able to taste her mouth on his in the Green _RARE_ parking lot . STO
* `` That story of hers about an _RARE_ note _RARE_ her to be there tonight sounds completely phony . STO
* If it was designed to put me on the spot , it would have to have been written before _RARE_ ever called me in on the case '' . STO
* `` Do you think Laura did have the _RARE_ _RARE_ made without her husband's knowledge '' ? STO
* `` I haven't the _RARE_ idea . STO
* I think her husband strongly _RARE_ so , and that's why he called me in on the thing in direct _RARE_ of his _RARE_ and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so . STO
* Isn't this _RARE_ street '' ? STO
* Shayne asked , peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign . STO
* Rourke could see it better out the _RARE_ side , and he said , `` yes . STO
* _RARE_ to the left , I think , for that number you gave me . STO
* Not more than a block or so '' . STO
* Shayne got in the _RARE_ _RARE_ and cut across the Boulevard _RARE_ . STO
* There was a small , _RARE_ restaurant and _RARE_ _RARE_ on the _RARE_ corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet , _RARE_ street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story _RARE_ , now cut up into furnished rooms and _RARE_ apartments . STO
* Shayne drove _RARE_ from the Boulevard slowly , letting Rourke _RARE_ his head out the window and watch for street numbers . STO
* A single automobile was parked _RARE_ up the block on the _RARE_ side . STO
* Shayne noted idly that it carried _RARE_ Beach license plates as he approached , and then saw the _RARE_ of a match in the front seat as they passed , indicating that it was occupied . STO
* He turned to see the _RARE_ faces of two men in the parked car just as Rourke said , `` It's the next house , Mike . STO
* On the right '' . STO
* Instead of pulling into the curb , Shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left . STO
* He went around the corner and parked , turning off his lights and motor . STO
* `` I told you , Mike '' , said Rourke in an _RARE_ voice . STO
* `` It was back there . STO
* '' Shayne said , `` I know it was , Tim '' . STO
* His voice was _RARE_ and cold . STO
* `` Did you see the car parked across the street '' ? STO
* `` I didn't notice it . STO
* I was watching for numbers . STO
* '' `` It has a Beach license , Tim . STO
* Two men in the front seat . STO
* I got a quick look at their faces as we went past . STO
* Unless I'm crazy as hell , they're two of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A couple named Harris and Geely . STO
* Those names mean anything to you '' ? STO
* `` Wait a minute , Mike . STO
* In _RARE_ office this evening . STO
* '' Shayne nodded grimly . STO
* `` The pair whom _RARE_ is officially _RARE_ for _RARE_ me around and pulling me in '' . STO
* `` What are they doing here '' ? STO
* `` A _RARE_ , I suppose . STO
* On _RARE_ Perrin . STO
* Maybe with specific orders to see that I don't make contact with her . STO
* I'm not positive , Tim . STO
* I may be wrong . STO
* I'll slide out and walk around the block back to the _RARE_ _RARE_ on _RARE_ . STO
* You drive on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there . STO
* You're a reporter , and you're looking for Miss Perrin to interview her . STO
* Make them show their hands . STO
* If they are Beach cops on a _RARE_ , they'll admit it to a reporter . STO
* They've got no official standing on this side of the Bay . STO
* As soon as you find out if they are Geely and Harris , come on around to the _RARE_ where I'll be waiting '' . STO
* Shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out . STO
* _RARE_ Rourke _RARE_ _RARE_ as he slid under the wheel . STO
* `` The things you talk me into , Mike . STO
* '' Shayne chuckled . STO
* `` How often do they add up to _RARE_ ? STO
* You should complain '' . STO
* He crossed the street and walked swiftly _RARE_ to circle back to the Boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant . STO
* He was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a _RARE_ of _RARE_ when Rourke came in six or eight minutes later . STO
* The reporter nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar . STO
* Shayne told the bartender , `` _RARE_ and water '' , and Rourke told him , `` It's those two , all right . STO
* Harris and Geely . STO
* I made them show me their identification before I could be persuaded not to call on _RARE_ Perrin '' . STO
* Shayne said happily , `` I've got it all worked out , Tim . STO
* Take your time with your drink . STO
* I'll beat it . STO
* In exactly three minutes , go in that phone _RARE_ behind you and call Police _RARE_ . STO
* Be excited and don't identify yourself . STO
* Just say that a couple of _RARE_ are having a hell of a fight down the street , and they better send a patrol car . STO
* Then hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address . STO
* I'll be waiting for you there '' . STO
* The bartender brought _RARE_ drink and Shayne laid a _RARE_ bill on the bar . STO
* He said in a low voice , `` I've got a date with a lady , Mister . STO
* Will that pay for a pint I can take with me . STO
* You know how it is '' , he added with a _RARE_ wink . STO
* `` _RARE_ is _RARE_ , but liquor is quicker and you don't have any _RARE_ for sale here anyhow '' . STO
* `` We sure don't '' . STO
* The bartender winked back at him and _RARE_ the bill . STO
* He turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper _RARE_ which he slid over the counter to Shayne . STO
* As the detective slid it into his pocket , Rourke asked sadly , `` What in hell are you going to do , Mike '' ? STO
* `` Make a couple of _RARE_ detectives named Geely and Harris wish to God they'd stayed out of my way this afternoon . STO
* Three minutes , Tim '' . STO
* Shayne strode out _RARE_ , and Rourke checked his watch and _RARE_ his drink , getting a _RARE_ ready to make the telephone call to the police . STO
* Outside , Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his _RARE_ directly in front of the bar headed south . STO
* He walked over to the _RARE_ door , opened it and got the _RARE_ automatic out of the _RARE_ compartment and put it in his hip pocket . STO
* He hoped he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives , but its weight was comforting at his hip . STO
* On this side of the Bay , _RARE_ Beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen , and _RARE_ pistol permit was just as good as theirs . STO
* He went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives in the front seat . STO
* He _RARE_ the _RARE_ of his hat low as he approached , stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the _RARE_ side . STO
* The big , _RARE_ man named Geely was on that side , _RARE_ in the seat toward his _RARE_ companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door . STO
* Shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night . STO
* Geely grunted and slid partly out , and _RARE_ left arm _RARE_ in around his neck to help him , while he set himself solidly on the _RARE_ and swung his right fist to the big , _RARE_ jaw before Geely could _RARE_ up . STO
* Shayne stepped back to let him _RARE_ to the ground , and then dived over him through the open door into Harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster , somewhat _RARE_ by the steering wheel . STO
* Shayne locked his big hands around _RARE_ thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the _RARE_ . STO
* He hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp . STO
* He dropped him into the street a couple of feet away from _RARE_ _RARE_ figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side . STO
* He didn't _RARE_ . STO
* They were both breathing heavily , out cold , and Shayne didn't think either of them had recognized him or could describe him . STO
* He got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and _RARE_ the top , _RARE_ the _RARE_ stuff _RARE_ over both men , and then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat . STO
* He turned , then , to look toward the lighted Boulevard , and saw _RARE_ tall , _RARE_ figure come out of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ start to angle across the street toward the opposite side . STO
* Shayne _RARE_ across to intercept the reporter in front of the two-story house where _RARE_ Perrin lived , and asked casually , `` Get the police okay '' ? STO
* `` Sure . STO
* Said they'd have a patrol car here fast . STO
* Let's get inside . STO
* What happened with you '' ? STO
* `` Why the two damned _RARE_ got all excited when they saw the bottle , and knocked each other out cold '' , Shayne said _RARE_ . STO
* `` They'll have fun explaining that to the _RARE_ cops . STO
* Got no business over here on a _RARE_ anyway '' . STO
* They went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling . STO
* A row of _RARE_ along the wall had numbers and names on them . STO
* Shayne found one marked Perrin Aj . STO
* The stairway on the right was dark , but there was a _RARE_ at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top , and they went up . STO
* There were two front rooms , both dark behind their _RARE_ , and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake . STO
* _RARE_ , nine steps above him , Roberts had paused . STO
* Mickey paused with him , waiting , no longer impatient , trying now to think it out , do a little planning . STO
* He looked down over the _RARE_ at the hotel desk , with the telephone and pen set . STO
* If I could call in , they could check the story while we were on our way . STO
* I wouldn't have to tell them I had Roberts -- Then he heard it , like a muffled _RARE_ , felt a subtle change in air pressure . STO
* He glanced up in time to see Roberts _RARE_ down on him from above , literally flying through the air , his bloody face twisted . STO
* Mickey tried to _RARE_ against the _RARE_ , gripped it with one hand , but Roberts' full weight struck him at that moment in the _RARE_ . STO
* He gasped for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail . STO
* He tumbled with Roberts , helpless and in agony , over and over , down the steps . STO
* By a _RARE_ effort , he managed to hunch and draw in , to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head . STO
* He was _RARE_ in his mind and , for a moment , helpless on the lobby floor , but he was conscious , and free of the weight of Roberts' body . STO
* When his vision cleared he saw the taller one _RARE_ upward , reaching . STO
* Mickey was on his knees when Roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand . STO
* He felt his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand . STO
* _RARE_ eyes fixed on the other's feet , which would first _RARE_ the moment and direction of an attack . STO
* He rose stiffly , forcing his knees to lock . STO
* The _RARE_ pain in his _RARE_ nearly brought him down again . STO
* He made himself back off slowly , his eyes _RARE_ on Roberts , who now had no more to lose than he . STO
* The pain _RARE_ as he moved , and he _RARE_ inside . STO
* After a moment he extended one hand , the fingers curled . STO
* `` Come on '' , he said . STO
* `` You want to be that big a fool -- I was hoping for this '' . STO
* Roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps . STO
* He held the razor well out to one side . STO
* He was _RARE_ to attack , but he could be handled , Mickey knew , if he could be brought to make the first move . STO
* They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared the last step . STO
* Mickey waited with _RARE_ arms . STO
* `` Any time , Roberts '' , he said . STO
* `` Or would it be easier if I put my hands in my pockets '' ? STO
* The _RARE_ was lost on Roberts . STO
* He advanced slowly , directly , giving no hint of a _RARE_ to either side . STO
* He was just short of _RARE_ reach when he stopped . STO
* Mickey backed off two steps , forcing him to come on again . STO
* There was a fixed grin on Roberts' face , made hideous by the swollen nose and the _RARE_ blood . STO
* Mickey backed off again and Roberts hesitated , then came along . STO
* They moved in a series of _RARE_ _RARE_ and starts , a _RARE_ dance -- two steps back , two steps forward , two steps back . STO
* Mickey felt his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door . STO
* This was going to be it now , any second , and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor , no matter what , even if Roberts should _RARE_ with a kick to the _RARE_ , the deadly hand was his exclusive concern . STO
* The kick came , sudden and vicious but short . STO
* _RARE_ guts twisted with the effort , but he kept his eye on the weapon . STO
* It moved in a silver arc toward his throat , then _RARE_ downward . STO
* He _RARE_ his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' _RARE_ with his own , felt the blade slide off his sleeve . STO
* Before Roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face , he slammed his right fist into Roberts' belly . STO
* Roberts _RARE_ and slashed at him wildly . STO
* _RARE_ , Mickey _RARE_ and fell to one side , landing heavily on the wood floor . STO
* Then Roberts was on him , gasping for breath and for a couple of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade . STO
* He felt it _RARE_ at the side of his jacket and a _RARE_ _RARE_ under his left ribs . STO
* He got a knee up into Roberts' belly , used both hands and _RARE_ him clear , then scrambled to his feet . STO
* They were in the center of the lobby now . STO
* Still clutching the razor , Roberts came up into a _RARE_ , shaking his head . STO
* When he charged Mickey was ready . STO
* He hit Roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him _RARE_ , then _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* With his right fist , and nearly all his weight behind it , he smashed at the _RARE_ face . STO
* Roberts _RARE_ backward , his back arched , fought for balance and , failing , stumbled against the _RARE_ post at the foot of the stairs . STO
* The sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate , _RARE_ sound . STO
* He fell on his side across the lowest step , rolled over once , then lay still . STO
* Mickey found himself leaning against the desk , with stiff hands , panting for breath . STO
* After a minute he went to Roberts , looked at one of his eyes and felt for a _RARE_ . STO
* He couldn't feel any . STO
* Roberts appeared to be dead ; ; if not yet , then soon , very soon . STO
* Suddenly it was cold in the lobby . STO
* 12 It seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do . STO
* Actually it was no more than eight or ten minutes , and the sum of his reasoning came to this : There's no way to take him in now and keep those other two -- _RARE_ and the one who hired the two of them -- from finding out about Roberts and _RARE_ out . STO
* The local law here would hold me till they check clear back home , and maybe more than that . STO
* They would have to . STO
* By then they could never catch up with the others . STO
* There's no other way ; ; I'll have to do it myself . STO
* He looked at where Roberts lay sprawled on the step . STO
* Mickey was sure now he was dead . STO
* One thing , he thought , nobody knows about it yet . STO
* Only me . STO
* He climbed the stairs , went into Roberts' room , found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could . STO
* He left a few things . STO
* It didn't have to be perfect . STO
* Roberts was a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ away on impulse , he might logically leave behind what it was _RARE_ to carry . STO
* When he had closed the suitcase he found a _RARE_ and moved about the room , _RARE_ carefully everything he might have touched . STO
* It took him nearly an hour . STO
* He went to the room he had _RARE_ and got into his overcoat . STO
* He left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby . STO
* He set Roberts' suitcase near the front door , went outside and walked back to the garage . STO
* He was _RARE_ surprised to find it was _RARE_ . STO
* It _RARE_ softly , silently , an _RARE_ _RARE_ of his vision against the night sky . STO
* He could feel it on his face and in his hair . STO
* He found the key to the Jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes . STO
* Then he backed out and swung around to the front drive . STO
* He went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor . STO
* He put it in his own pocket for _RARE_ . STO
* He took the suitcase out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat . STO
* Then he went back for Roberts . STO
* The body was heavier than he had anticipated . STO
* He got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep . STO
* He dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out , then returned to the porch and closed the front door , making sure it was unlocked . STO
* He drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier . STO
* It _RARE_ continuously , but quietly , _RARE_ . STO
* When he reached the _RARE_ in the woods , he saw that already the earlier _RARE_ were barely discernible . STO
* The Jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground . STO
* He drove in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine . STO
* He parked facing it and left the headlights on , but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase , he found the _RARE_ extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the passage . STO
* He went back and got the flashlight , returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier . STO
* He tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it . STO
* When the dust settled , he went back to the Jeep and carefully worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder . STO
* It wasn't like carrying the suitcase . STO
* The soft snow was _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ he nearly fell . STO
* Inside the passage , he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his _RARE_ burden . STO
* By the time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back _RARE_ under the drag of the dead weight . STO
* He stood looking down for a few seconds , then backed up two or three _RARE_ from the edge . STO
* There was too much weight casually to toss it away . STO
* He could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out . STO
* It would be a bad place to die . STO
* It was a bad place for Roberts to wind up , but Roberts had asked for it . STO
* It was too late to worry about that . STO
* He knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel . STO
* It was a relief to get rid of the weight . STO
* He was shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down . STO
* Then he got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge . STO
* It hung _RARE_ on the point of dropping off . STO
* He gave it a strong push , heard it slide , then _RARE_ _RARE_ into the hole . STO
* He got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit . STO
* The body lay in an awkward _RARE_ twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor . STO
* Deep enough , he decided . STO
* There was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter . STO
* The external signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow , probably by the next day . STO
* It wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact . STO
* By spring it would be a _RARE_ . STO
* He made his way back to the Jeep . STO
* He had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket . STO
* He climbed down , went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit . STO
* It landed on Roberts' sprawled right thigh , poised _RARE_ , then slid off to the ground . STO
* He went back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel . STO
* In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of it . STO
* There were stains here and there and he cleaned them off , using an _RARE_ _RARE_ he found on a nail . STO
* He wiped the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep . STO
* He replaced the flashlight where it had been _RARE_ , got into his own car and backed it out of the garage . STO
* There were tire marks where it had been , but they were _RARE_ by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , he thought , might spend some time _RARE_ for her lost lover , but he doubted that she would _RARE_ an investigation . STO
* He judged her to be a woman of some pride , though not much sense . STO
* Still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who , apparently , had run away . STO
* He put in a call to _RARE_ from his hotel room . STO
* The maid answered and he decided _RARE_ must be at work . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ him not to be too hopeful and then , _RARE_ his own advice , said excitedly , `` But it does sound good . STO
* A woman named _RARE_ who tells nobody anything about herself . STO
* That _RARE_ picture with the same _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I'm not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm . STO
* I'll call you in a day or so '' . STO
* On the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over Lake _RARE_ and along the coast . STO
* Gulf _RARE_ was ten miles _RARE_ -- more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach made _RARE_ by tourist _RARE_ . STO
* He checked into a motel and drove downtown . STO
* The _RARE_ was a _RARE_ building minus the customary dome . STO
* Instead of the usual _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and patches of bare dirt in most _RARE_ squares , the building was _RARE_ in by a _RARE_ growth of _RARE_ and _RARE_ and a smooth lawn the _RARE_ _RARE_ shade of _RARE_ grass . STO
* He figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff . STO
* A clerk in the outer office took him in to _RARE_ _RARE_ , a big , _RARE_ man with thick , white hair and a voice with a _RARE_ resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office . STO
* _RARE_ in front of the desk , Hank said , `` I'm looking for some information with very little to go on , _RARE_ '' . STO
* He explained the background of the case , ending with the _RARE_ clue which had brought him to Gulf _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ chair tilted back . STO
* `` So you're looking for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been _RARE_ . STO
* If there was such a person , I'm afraid she got away with it . STO
* _RARE_ we don't know more about him . STO
* I think the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the _RARE_ match with the _RARE_ a little later . STO
* It'll be a _RARE_ job , but if you want to try it , the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county _RARE_ office '' . STO
* `` Maybe the society editor would remember a _RARE_ _RARE_ bride '' . STO
* `` That's an idea . STO
* Mrs. Calhoun has been society editor here for twenty-five years . STO
* The editor says that marriages may be made in heaven , but _RARE_ are made in Mrs. _RARE_ columns . STO
* She's the one who _RARE_ which wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday paper and all that '' . STO
* He smiled . STO
* `` Once , when the editor was just out of the hospital from a _RARE_ operation , Mrs. Calhoun and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out beside his bed . STO
* She'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about background . STO
* She'd have made a great _RARE_ dedicated to _RARE_ down _RARE_ and environment . STO
* She'd also remember if the _RARE_ died later '' . STO
* He stood up . STO
* `` I wish you good luck , but please don't dig up too tough a case for me this close to election . STO
* If you find out anything , come on back here and we'll get started on it '' . STO
* _RARE_ down Mrs. Calhoun was like trying to catch up with Paul _RARE_ between _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* It turned out that she also sold real estate , cosmetics , and hospital insurance . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ stretched into the afternoon -- from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper , where he found her at five o'clock . STO
* She was a large woman with a _RARE_ gray _RARE_ cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while she hunted and _RARE_ on an old typewriter . STO
* It took a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted . STO
* `` Last year ? STO
* Well , I do remember one . STO
* From _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ a man named _RARE_ Black . STO
* I remember her because she didn't want her picture in the paper . STO
* First bride like that I've seen in twenty-five years '' . STO
* `` What reason did she give '' ? STO
* `` Said she had a _RARE_ on her face -- some sort of _RARE_ -- and none of her old pictures was good enough . STO
* I didn't see her till several days later at the wedding , and her face looked like it had never had a _RARE_ on it . STO
* But , of course , you couldn't see too well through the _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Was her name _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Now how in hell would I remember that '' ? STO
* `` Never mind . STO
* I can look it up . STO
* Do they still live here '' ? STO
* `` I think they moved away shortly after they were married . STO
* He was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred . STO
* I'm sure it'll be in the files . STO
* We usually run a social note when somebody moves away '' . STO
* He stood up and _RARE_ her . STO
* `` Have they inherited some money or something '' ? STO
* She asked with a _RARE_ _RARE_ in her eye . STO
* He said vaguely , `` Well , it is a little legal matter , but nothing like that '' . STO
* He hurried across to the _RARE_ and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving . STO
* `` _RARE_ like what you're after '' , he said when Hank had finished . STO
* `` Come on , let's hurry down before they lock up for the day '' . STO
* In the basement the sheriff took him to a small , dingy office occupied by a tall , thin man informal in _RARE_ shirt sleeves . STO
* `` Mr. _RARE_ Hirey _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the board of _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ is a private detective , Hirey . STO
* _RARE_ to look up something in the newspaper files , so don't lock him in here '' . STO
* `` Sure '' , said Hirey . STO
* `` I'll just leave the door open . STO
* It _RARE_ when you close it , so stay as long as you like '' . STO
* _RARE_ crossed the room to a metal door with an open _RARE_ in the top half . STO
* He pulled it open . STO
* `` Now don't shut this door . STO
* It won't open from inside . STO
* Before we built the new jail , we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded . STO
* Hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners . STO
* They were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with the cold air from _RARE_ air _RARE_ coming through the _RARE_ '' . STO
* He walked past the sheriff into a _RARE_ room with shelves full of big , _RARE_ volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls . STO
* A metal table and four chairs stood in the center . STO
* `` They're all here , back to _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ told him . STO
* `` It's all right to smoke , but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave . STO
* And , of course , you know not to take _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I'll leave the air _RARE_ on for you , Mr. _RARE_ '' , said Hirey . STO
* `` Don't forget to turn it off and close the door good so it'll _RARE_ '' . STO
* Hank _RARE_ them and promised to observe the rules . STO
* When they had gone , he stood for a minute breathing in the _RARE_ of old paper and leather which the _RARE_ _RARE_ air _RARE_ couldn't quite _RARE_ . STO
* Chapter fourteen In a tour around the _RARE_ , he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed _RARE_ around the room . STO
* An old weakness for _RARE_ in records rose up to _RARE_ him . STO
* It was , indeed , all here -- almost a century . STO
* From _RARE_ to moon _RARE_ . STO
* But he pulled away from the _RARE_ old volumes and walked around to the newer ones . STO
* Last year's volume was at the top a couple of inches below the ceiling . STO
* _RARE_ it was a metal ladder on _RARE_ attached to the top shelf . STO
* He pulled it over , climbed up , and lifted out the big volume , almost losing his balance from the weight of it . STO
* He staggered over and dropped it on the table . STO
* Since Mrs. Calhoun remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring , he started to _RARE_ through several months . STO
* He tried to turn right to the society page in each one , but interesting stories kept _RARE_ up to _RARE_ him . STO
* At last he found it in the paper of April 2 . STO
* It told him little more than Mrs. Calhoun had remembered , stating that it had been a small , modest wedding compared to some of the others . STO
* There was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. Black's life was an open book , so to speak , from his birth in Jackson , _RARE_ , through his _RARE_ days at _RARE_ and his _RARE_ of a _RARE_ degree , which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The one line on the bride said she was Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* No mention of New Orleans . STO
* Hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for Mr. Black . STO
* If Mrs. Black was who he thought she was , Mr. Black's _RARE_ selling days might well be over . STO
* Now for their _RARE_ from Gulf _RARE_ . STO
* This time the search took twice as long , cutting down on his extra reading , for he had to pick through several columns of one- and _RARE_ social notes in each issue . STO
* He found it in the edition of May 15 . STO
* The item said Mr. and Mrs. Black had moved to Jackson , his home town -- so the lovely _RARE_ had been with him a year ago . STO
* Next on his program was a call to the Jackson office of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to find out if _RARE_ Black was still with them -- or , more specifically , still with us . STO
* He glanced at his watch , saw it was only seven , and decided to _RARE_ his weakness now . STO
* For the next hour he scrambled happily up and down the ladder , sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ fire in Chicago , and the _RARE_ trial . STO
* In the middle of the stock market crash , he heard a slight noise in the outer office . STO
* He turned around , saw nothing , and decided it must be a mouse . STO
* Something else _RARE_ him , yet there was no sound , only _RARE_ silence . STO
* Then he knew it was not sound , but lack of it . STO
* The air _RARE_ was no longer running . STO
* He jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing . STO
* It _RARE_ shut as he sprang toward it . STO
* He pressed his face against the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Who's there '' ? STO
* The light shining through the _RARE_ dimly _RARE_ the office beyond -- enough for him to see there was no one there . STO
* Then he heard the outer door closing . STO
* `` Hey , come back '' , he shouted . STO
* He thought it must be some damn _RARE_ or cleaning woman _RARE_ around , _RARE_ that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up . STO
* Then the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind . STO
* Unless he was _RARE_ , the person who'd just left couldn't have missed seeing Hank through the open door of the _RARE_ lighted room . STO
* And even if he'd somehow missed seeing him , he wouldn't have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room . STO
* Whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here , had followed him and waited till the _RARE_ and square were deserted . STO
* But why ? STO
* To search his room at the motel ? STO
* To come back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left ? STO
* No , they could kill him just as easy right now . STO
* Nobody could hear what was going on in this underground _RARE_ . STO
* Then he heard it and smelled it -- the steady _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , familiar _RARE_ of gas _RARE_ . STO
* It must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the _RARE_ office . STO
* Until now , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ had been like an _RARE_ which he could _RARE_ at his own pace and choosing . STO
* _RARE_ for those minutes in her room , he had lost touch with her as a reality . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ had _RARE_ him into thinking of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , separately or together , as a _RARE_ . STO
* They kept _RARE_ apart and _RARE_ again in his mind like some minute form of life on a _RARE_ slide . STO
* `` Well '' -- said Mr. Skyros . STO
* `` I take a little time to think it over '' . STO
* It was awkward : very awkward . STO
* There would be all the _RARE_ of _RARE_ someone else to take over . STO
* Someone reasonably _RARE_ . STO
* And Angie would hear about it . STO
* And Angie knew -- `` Time '' , said Angie , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros . STO
* `` Not too much time , because I'll be needing some more myself pretty much right away . STO
* And I done favors for you , big favor not so long back , didn't I , and I'm right here to take on where Pretty left off . STO
* No trouble . STO
* I don't want no trouble , you don't want no trouble , nobody wants trouble , Mr. Skyros '' . STO
* _RARE_ heaven , no , thought Mr. Skyros , turning away as another man came in . STO
* He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; ; the _RARE_ smile seemed painted on his face . STO
* Angie knew -- _RARE_ of dangerous information ! STO
* Angie knew too much entirely already . STO
* Really he had Mr. Skyros at bay `` Big favor I done you . STO
* _RARE_ there's this deal o' _RARE_ -- and _RARE_ -- _RARE_ _RARE_ fire , ain't it , maybe you've been _RARE_ _RARE_ over that . STO
* And can't say I blame you '' , said Angie thoughtfully . STO
* `` This deal with the ace o' _RARE_ . STO
* Anything to do with an ace o' _RARE_ , bad luck '' . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ -- a widow , that was what they called a widow , these _RARE_ _RARE_ remembered Mr. Skyros _RARE_ . STO
* All about that Angie knew , too . STO
* When things got a little out of hand , they very rapidly got a lot out of hand -- it seemed to be a general rule . STO
* All just by chance , and in a way tracing back to poor Frank , all of it , because naturally -- brothers , living together -- and Angie -- Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on _RARE_ _RARE_ , almost _RARE_ _RARE_ face -- or indeed anything about Angelo . STO
* Mr. Skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles ; ; he found money much more interesting ; ; but all the same he thought now , _RARE_ , of the way in which Angelo earned his living -- and paid for his own stuff -- and eyed the soft smile , and the _RARE_ dark eyes , and he felt a little ill . STO
* `` Look , my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the _RARE_ says , better an _RARE_ of prevention to a pound of cure . STO
* I stay in business so long because I'm careful . STO
* Two weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that , then we make a little deal , isn't it '' ? STO
* `` That's a long while '' , said Angie . STO
* `` I tell you , you want to leave it that way , I don't fool around with it . STO
* I go over to Castro and get fixed up there . STO
* I can't wait no two weeks '' . STO
* And Mr. Skyros didn't like Angie , but what with _RARE_ and three of his boys inside , and not likely to come out -- And Angie such a valuable salesman , _RARE_ said -- All the _RARE_ and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys -- Why did everything have to happen at once ? STO
* _RARE_ said _RARE_ , `` Why , you ain't turning Angie down , are you , Mr. Skyros ? STO
* I mean , we all figured -- I guess _RARE_ figure -- Angie '' -- Angelo gave him an _RARE_ smile . STO
* `` Mr. Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me '' , he said . STO
* `` It's O.K. , _RARE_ , _RARE_ O.K. _RARE_ it , Mr. Skyros '' ? STO
* Oh , God , the name repeated over and over , anybody to hear -- Not being a fool , Mr. Skyros knew why . STO
* But aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have _RARE_ with one who was _RARE_ an _RARE_ and actually held -- you could say -- the whip hand . STO
* And all because of _RARE_ ! STO
* If Mr. Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause -- Of course , there was another factor . STO
* Angie worth his weight in gold right now , but these users , they sometimes went down fast . STO
* Who knew , Angie might not last long . STO
* The sweat broke out on Mr. _RARE_ forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking -- hoping -- planning -- perhaps -- Good God above , had not _RARE_ been enough ? STO
* He patted _RARE_ thin shoulder _RARE_ . STO
* `` Now you don't want to go talking that way '' , he said . STO
* `` Sure , sure , you're the one take over for Pretty , soon as I get the supply , get started up again , isn't it ? STO
* You don't need worry , Angelo . STO
* I tell you , I know how it is with you , my friend , I _RARE_ , and I'll make it a special point -- a special favor -- get in touch , and get some stuff just for you . STO
* I don't know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but I'll try my best , my friend . STO
* You see , you got to remember , we all got schedules , like any business ! STO
* My man , he won't be around a little while , he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the _RARE_ . STO
* It's awkward , you see that , isn't it '' ? STO
* `` Well , that's your business , Mr. Skyros '' , said Angie , and his _RARE_ eyes moved past Mr. _RARE_ shoulder to gaze vaguely out the _RARE_ window . STO
* `` I appreciate it , you do that . STO
* Sure . STO
* We don't none of us want no trouble . STO
* I'm in a room over the _RARE_ Club on San _RARE_ , you just ask for me there , you want see me . STO
* Or maybe I call you -- tonight ? STO
* About nine o'clock , I call and see if you got any . STO
* A couple _RARE_ for me , Mr. Skyros -- and _RARE_ to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash '' . STO
* `` Oh , now , I don't know about that much '' , said Mr. Skyros . STO
* `` And you know , Angelo , Pretty , he always keeps it a strict cash basis , like they say '' -- `` Sure '' , said Angie . STO
* `` Sure , Mr. Skyros . STO
* Fifty a throw , that the deal ? STO
* Sure . STO
* I bring you the cash , say five hundred for ten _RARE_ . STO
* Never mind how much I cut it , how much I get '' , and he smiled his sleepy smile again . STO
* `` Standard deal , Mr. Skyros . STO
* You go _RARE_ have a look round for it '' . STO
* `` I do my best '' , said Mr. Skyros earnestly , `` just for you , my friend . STO
* This is awkward for everybody , isn't it , we all got to put up with _RARE_ sometimes . STO
* But I do my best for you '' . STO
* He got out of there in a hurry , brushing past another man in the door , _RARE_ his brow . STO
* The _RARE_ thing -- yes , very true , one must make do as one could , in some situations . STO
* It could all be straightened out later . STO
* Not very much later , but when things had settled down a little . STO
* After this deal with the _RARE_ woman went through . STO
* An ace of _RARE_ . STO
* He was not a _RARE_ man , but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that , indeed . STO
* He rather wished he had never got into the business , and still -- scarcely to be resisted , a nice little profit with not much work involved , easy money _RARE_ _RARE_ , who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now , rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change . STO
* She did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks . STO
* _RARE_ she marked the few who did thank you , you didn't get that kind much in a place like this : and she played a little game with herself , seeing how _RARE_ _RARE_ she could act to the others , before they'd take _RARE_ , _RARE_ to call the manager . STO
* _RARE_ how seldom they did : used to it , probably . STO
* The kind who came into a cheap store like this ! STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ , I saw that first ! STO
* And , Here , I'll take this , I was before her , you wait on me now or I don't bother with it , see ! STO
* This kind of place She'd be through here , just no time at all -- leave this kind of thing _RARE_ behind . STO
* _RARE_ at noon , and she'd never come back . STO
* Never have to . STO
* _RARE_ -- a lot of money , enough . STO
* She'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills _RARE_ nobody would suspect -- maybe couldn't get it until Monday account of that , the banks -- But that wasn't really long to wait . STO
* Not when she'd waited so long already . STO
* No need say anything at all to the old woman . STO
* She had it all planned out , how she'd do . STO
* She'd say she didn't feel good on Sunday , couldn't go to church -- _RARE_ be a little argument , but she could be stubborn -- and when the old woman had gone , quick pack the things she'd need to take , all but the dress she'd wear Monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight , for a _RARE_ . STO
* Then on Monday morning -- or it might have to be Tuesday -- get up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer . STO
* She wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after _RARE_ had left , go do the daily shopping . STO
* No need leave a note with it , either -- or maybe just something like , Don't worry about me , I'm going away to make a better life . STO
* A better life . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* It wasn't as if she wanted much . STO
* She didn't mind working hard , not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft -- all she wanted was a chance , where she wasn't marked as what she was . STO
* To be Katharine Ross , and work in a _RARE_ shop somewhere , at a little more money so she could have _RARE_ clothes , and learn ladies' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up to now , not just the ones like her here , with _RARE_ names , the ones went to the same church and -- _RARE_ place , different job , different people , she'd be all different too . STO
* _RARE_ , she'd do her hair another way ; ; _RARE_ , and wear different kinds of clothes -- she'd be Katharine Ross , just what that sounded like . STO
* `` You've give me the wrong change '' , said the customer sharply . STO
* `` _RARE_ I can't count '' ? STO
* _RARE_ made up the amount in indifferent silence . STO
* She was listening to other voices , out of the future . STO
* Some of those _RARE_ new , different people . STO
* Oh , _RARE_ awfully nice , and pretty too , I like Katharine -- Let's ask Katharine to go with us , she's always lots of fun -- Katharine -- Soon , very soon now sixteen _RARE_ didn't wake until nearly _RARE_ . STO
* It was going to be another hot day ; ; already the thermometer stood close to _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ was still sound asleep ; ; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk _RARE_ for more cigarettes before thinking of her _RARE_ , and found a _RARE_ stray cigarette at its bottom , which tasted _RARE_ of face powder . STO
* He left a note _RARE_ on the desk asking her to call him _RARE_ today , and drove home . STO
* After he'd got out fresh liver for _RARE_ , he paused to look at her crouched _RARE_ over her dish . STO
* Surely she was just a trifle _RARE_ around the middle ? STO
* He seemed to remember reading somewhere that _RARE_ had large _RARE_ , and suffered a _RARE_ vision of the apartment _RARE_ with a dozen kittens . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* -- What then '' ? STO
* He asked her severely . STO
* `` A lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like cats , it's not the _RARE_ thing in the world to find good homes for kittens -- and , damn it , you know very well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away ! STO
* And I suppose now that you've finally grown up , if a little late , you'd go on producing kittens every six months or so . STO
* Yes , well , it's a pity to _RARE_ your _RARE_ figure -- which all those kittens would do anyway -- but I think when you've raised these we'll just have the _RARE_ fix it so there won't be any more . STO
* I wonder if the _RARE_ would take one . STO
* And it's no good looking at me like that '' , as she wound _RARE_ around his _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up . STO
* `` _RARE_ to be in the hall ! STO
* _RARE_ to hear you quarrel about her ! STO
* Oh , well , you can't really blame Lolotte . STO
* She lost her _RARE_ to you '' . STO
* But she was talking of Emile when she saw the black line of the open door ; ; Sarah remembered it clearly . STO
* Maude went on . STO
* `` I've got to get busy . STO
* Miss _RARE_ taken to her bed , with the door locked . STO
* She opened it an inch and _RARE_ out the keys for me to give you . STO
* Here '' -- She thrust a bundle of keys _RARE_ on a thick red cord into _RARE_ hand . STO
* `` Not that there's much use in locking up the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ now . STO
* _RARE_ your coffee '' -- coffee . STO
* `` It's -- cold '' . STO
* Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat . STO
* `` I don't want it '' , Sarah said , firmly . STO
* `` Oh . STO
* Well -- I'll take it down with me as I go '' . STO
* Maude _RARE_ up the cup and _RARE_ up her top _RARE_ as if about to take off with a racing start . STO
* At the door she turned back , her Roman nose looking very long now and _RARE_ . STO
* `` I forgot . STO
* Ben and Lucien have gone after them . STO
* It's just like that book your Northern friend wrote -- except there aren't any ice _RARE_ to cross and no _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I don't know Mrs. _RARE_ . STO
* What can they do if they find them '' ? STO
* `` They can't do anything . STO
* It's silly , childish , running after them like that . STO
* I told Ben so . STO
* But of course the _RARE_ won't be of any help , not with everything so upset and that _RARE_ _RARE_ outfit they say is running around , God knows where '' . STO
* She had _RARE_ away , she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her , _RARE_ out the coffee , so no one would drink it . STO
* But then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best , cold it was all but _RARE_ -- especially that cup ! STO
* She was deeply , _RARE_ sure that Lucien had filled it with opium . STO
* She had _RARE_ with Lucien , she had resisted his demands for money -- and if she died , by the provisions of her marriage contract , Lucien would _RARE_ _RARE_ not only the immediate sum of gold under the _RARE_ in the office , but later , when the war was over , her father's entire estate . STO
* She felt cold and hot , sticky and _RARE_ at the same time . STO
* Now wait a minute , she told herself , think about it ; ; Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee . STO
* She had lost a bottle of opium -- but that was on the trip from New Orleans . STO
* Or someone had taken it during her first day at _RARE_ . STO
* Yes , she had missed it after her talk with Emile , after dinner , just before Emile was shot . STO
* _RARE_ or Glendora had entered her room while she slept , bringing back her washed clothes . STO
* So somebody else could have come in , too -- then or later while she was out of the room . STO
* It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor . STO
* It was not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had _RARE_ _RARE_ opium and come back to _RARE_ with a formed plan to murder her . STO
* He didn't even know that she was there . STO
* And he certainly couldn't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the _RARE_ -- yes , and _RARE_ fool he had every right to expect . STO
* No , he had been surprised , _RARE_ surprised , but surprised . STO
* Then somebody else ? STO
* Don't question , Rev had said , don't _RARE_ danger . STO
* Her skin crawled : Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open . STO
* Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile , she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a _RARE_ of blackness in the hall . STO
* So Lolotte -- or anybody -- could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium . STO
* That was not reasonable either . STO
* The opium had disappeared before _RARE_ death and _RARE_ shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen _RARE_ own _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- and questions . STO
* She began to doubt whether there had been in fact a _RARE_ dose of opium in the cup . STO
* So suppose somebody only wished to frighten her , so she would leave _RARE_ ! STO
* That made a certain amount of logic . STO
* _RARE_ to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she wouldn't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by its taste . STO
* No . STO
* It was merely an attempt to frighten her . STO
* She wouldn't go back to New York as Maude suggested ; ; she wouldn't run like a scared cat . STO
* But -- well , she'd be very careful . STO
* She dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life . STO
* But before she left her room she dug into her big _RARE_ bag , took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken . STO
* So somebody else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died . STO
* Rev had known all along . STO
* Rev didn't need to break the wax seal , read the contract and find out . STO
* He could _RARE_ have wished to make sure ; ; Rev loved _RARE_ , it was like a part of his breath and body ; ; Rev had stressed the need for money . STO
* Rev would never have tried to give her _RARE_ ! STO
* She thrust the envelope back in the bag ; ; there was no point in locking it up in the _RARE_ now , it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen . STO
* And in all likelihood , by now , there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract . STO
* There was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd been . STO
* She went downstairs and received another curious shock , for when Glendora _RARE_ into the dining room in her _RARE_ _RARE_ , Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she hadn't . STO
* `` Too much work this morning , Miss Sarah -- everybody gone like that '' -- Sarah swallowed past another kind of _RARE_ in her throat . STO
* `` Well , then who brought it '' ? STO
* `` Miss Maude . STO
* She come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you '' . STO
* Glendora put down a dish of _RARE_ rice . STO
* `` Not much breakfast this morning . STO
* I don't know what we're going to do , Miss Sarah '' . STO
* `` We've got to eat '' , Sarah said , _RARE_ , because a chill crawled over her again . STO
* Maude ? STO
* Glendora _RARE_ away . STO
* The rice wasn't _RARE_ with opium , indeed it had no taste at all , not a grain of salt . STO
* She ate what she could and went out along the covered _RARE_ , with the rain dripping from the vines . STO
* In the kitchen Glendora was _RARE_ picking chickens . STO
* `` Get a basket '' , Sarah told her . STO
* `` We'll go to the _RARE_ '' . STO
* Glendora dropped a chicken and a _RARE_ of feathers , and went with her through the drizzle , to the _RARE_ . STO
* Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door . STO
* It was a long , low room , like a root cellar , for it was _RARE_ up with soil , and vines had run _RARE_ over that , too . STO
* It was dark but dry and cool . STO
* She _RARE_ out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried _RARE_ , eggs , _RARE_ , a little salt . STO
* The shelves looked _RARE_ than when Miss _RARE_ had shown her the _RARE_ , and since the men from the _RARE_ had called ; ; there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with . STO
* She took Glendora to the _RARE_ , unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of _RARE_ and sides of bacon , hanging from the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* They wouldn't go hungry , not yet . STO
* And the fields were green and growing . STO
* `` Can't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like , here '' ? STO
* Maude had said . STO
* Maude . STO
* She sent Glendora back to the house , her basket and her apron laden . STO
* She stood for a moment , rain dripping from the trees over her head , thinking of Maude . STO
* Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from _RARE_ room . STO
* Maude had the cool _RARE_ to do whatever she made up her mind to do . STO
* She couldn't see how her death could affect Maude . STO
* She couldn't see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her . STO
* Besides , there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her . STO
* Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish . STO
* Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New York . STO
* Maude could have shot Emile -- if she'd had a reason to kill him . STO
* There was no use in standing there in the drizzle , trying to find a link between _RARE_ murder and opium in a cup of coffee . STO
* She started back for the house , saw a light in the office , opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder . STO
* Rev , George and Lolotte were _RARE_ shoes . STO
* A lighted lamp stood on the table that _RARE_ , _RARE_ day . STO
* They were all three bent over a _RARE_ riding boot ; ; George had a _RARE_ hammer . STO
* Lolotte held a patch of leather , Rev _RARE_ something , a tiny _RARE_ , waiting for _RARE_ poised hammer . STO
* George said , `` First thing I do when I get to _RARE_ again , is get me a _RARE_ '' -- `` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed softly . STO
* Rev looked up and saw her . STO
* Lolotte looked up and stiffened . STO
* George didn't look up at all . STO
* There was no way to know , no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at _RARE_ appearance , _RARE_ her to be _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- and just possibly dead . STO
* Rev said , `` Come in , Sarah . STO
* _RARE_ you know the news '' . STO
* And what news , Sarah thought as _RARE_ as Maude might have said it . STO
* _RARE_ face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning . STO
* He turned to George and Lolotte . STO
* `` Take your _RARE_ shop somewhere else . STO
* I want to talk to Sarah '' . STO
* Everything in the office , the spreading circle of _RARE_ , the patch of leather in _RARE_ hands . STO
* George poised with the _RARE_ hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder . STO
* A rush of panic caught Sarah . STO
* `` No . STO
* Not now . STO
* I mean I've got to -- to see to the kitchen . STO
* Glendora '' -- Her words _RARE_ together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in _RARE_ face . STO
* Now why did I do that ? STO
* She thought as warm , _RARE_ rain touched her face . STO
* She was no _RARE_ , refusing to bear _RARE_ . STO
* As she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself ; ; if she told anyone of the opium it must be Lucien , her husband . STO
* It might be , indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love , but it was marriage . STO
* So she couldn't choose Rev as a _RARE_ ; ; it must be Lucien . STO
* Always provided that Lucien himself had not _RARE_ her coffee with opium , she thought , as coldly and sharply , again , as Maude might have said it . STO
* She paused at the kitchen door , caught her breath , told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen , where Glendora was _RARE_ the chickens _RARE_ and Maude was cleaning lamp _RARE_ . STO
* Glendora gave a _RARE_ . STO
* `` Miss Sarah , I can't cut up no chicken . STO
* Miss Maude say she won't '' . STO
* Again the homely , everyday details of daily living _RARE_ a vicious attempt to frighten her -- or to murder her . STO
* The homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate _RARE_ . STO
* No matter what had happened or hadn't happened , somebody had to see about dinner . STO
* She eyed the chickens with , if she had known it , something of _RARE_ _RARE_ look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin verbs . STO
* `` Not since last night . STO
* I didn't think there was any reason to '' . STO
* `` Maybe there isn't . STO
* _RARE_ to him again anyway . STO
* Try talking to some of the fellows he works with , friends , anyone . STO
* Try to find out how happy he is with his wife , whether he plays around with women . STO
* You might try looking into his wife too . STO
* She might have been talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been having any trouble '' . STO
* `` You think Black's the one we're looking for '' ? STO
* `` Yeah . STO
* I think he might be '' , Conrad said grimly . STO
* `` Then again he might not '' . STO
* `` What a _RARE_ world '' , Rourke said . STO
* `` Black is _RARE_ best friend '' . STO
* `` I know '' . STO
* `` Will you be coming back soon '' ? STO
* `` I think so . STO
* I'm on my way to see the _RARE_ woman '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ secretary ? STO
* What for ? STO
* You don't think Gilborn is the -- '' ? STO
* `` I don't think anything . STO
* I just don't want to go off _RARE_ before picking up Black , that's all '' . STO
* Conrad interrupted . STO
* `` Gilborn says he was in his office all day with her yesterday . STO
* I'd like to make sure . STO
* Also , it's just possible she might know something about Mrs. Gilborn '' . STO
* `` Right . STO
* I'll see you later '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ you ever going to go home '' ? STO
* `` It sure as hell doesn't look like it , does it ? STO
* I'm telling you , if these _RARE_ ever knew the trouble they put us to , they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off '' . STO
* `` Remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet '' . STO
* Conrad hung up and sat on the small _RARE_ bench , _RARE_ his right leg . STO
* He looked at his watch . STO
* It was ten minutes before eleven . STO
* He wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession from _RARE_ Black . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ experience let him know , even at this early stage , that Black was his man . STO
* But he still wanted to know why . STO
* It was a cold , _RARE_ day , the day after _RARE_ death , but Stanley Gilborn paid no attention to the _RARE_ October wind . STO
* After leaving Conrad , Gilborn had no destination . STO
* He simply walked , not _RARE_ where he was , not caring . STO
* He stopped automatically at the street corners , waiting for the traffic lights to change , _RARE_ of other people , his coat open and _RARE_ . STO
* As he walked , he tried to think . STO
* Of Kitti . STO
* Of himself . STO
* _RARE_ of what Conrad had tried to make him believe . STO
* There was nothing _RARE_ about his thinking . STO
* It was a succession of _RARE_ passing through his mind : the same ones , different ones , in no apparent sequence , in no logical succession . STO
* The _RARE_ of what Conrad had told him made it impossible for Gilborn to accept , with any degree of _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of it . STO
* _RARE_ words had intellectual meaning for him only . STO
* _RARE_ , they _RARE_ him not at all . STO
* Whoever he was and your wife were intimate . STO
* Gilborn remembered _RARE_ exact words . STO
* They made sense and yet they didn't . STO
* He knew Conrad had told him the truth . STO
* It was so . STO
* Yet it wasn't so . STO
* It wasn't so because it couldn't be so . STO
* When Kitti was alive -- and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm -- she had been the center of his life . STO
* She was the sun , he the _RARE_ planet _RARE_ around her , the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed . STO
* For _RARE_ years he had lived , _RARE_ towards a _RARE_ , eating , working , breathing without plan , without reason . STO
* Kitti had come along to justify everything . STO
* She was his goal , she was his reason . STO
* He had lived all his life waiting for her . STO
* Not once , in the time that he had known her , had he ever considered the possibility , not once , not for one _RARE_ of a second , of her _RARE_ . STO
* He could not consider it now . STO
* Not really . STO
* And so he walked , _RARE_ again . STO
* The walk ended , inevitably , right in front of his hotel building . STO
* The _RARE_ began to nod his head automatically , then remembered who Gilborn was , what had happened to him the night before . STO
* He looked at Gilborn with _RARE_ curiosity . STO
* Gilborn passed by him without seeing him . STO
* He crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts . STO
* In the apartment itself , all was still . STO
* The police were no longer there . STO
* There was no evidence that anything was different than it had been . STO
* _RARE_ that Kitti wasn't there . STO
* Without taking off his coat , he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door . STO
* At last , sitting there , in the familiar _RARE_ , the truth began to sink in . STO
* Who ? STO
* He felt no anger towards Kitti , no sense that she had betrayed him . STO
* Who ? STO
* She was all he had , everything he had , everything he wanted . STO
* Someone had taken her away from him . STO
* Who ? STO
* Where there is a _RARE_ entry in the _RARE_ , there is a _RARE_ one , he remembered from his school days . STO
* Where there is a victim , there is a killer . STO
* Who ? STO
* Whoever he was and your wife were intimate . STO
* He rose from the chair , took off his coat . STO
* _RARE_ , he went into the bedroom . STO
* The bed still showed signs of where Kitti had _RARE_ . STO
* Gilborn stood there for a long time . STO
* He looked at the bed _RARE_ . STO
* The bed was empty now . STO
* Kitti would lie in it no more . STO
* He would lie in it no more . STO
* Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had _RARE_ in that same bed with Who ? STO
* For thirty minutes , Stanley Gilborn stood there . STO
* At the end of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ his brains , thinking over and over again of Kitti , her friends , her past , he left the bedroom . STO
* Who ? STO
* He could think of no answer . STO
* Gilborn put on his coat again . STO
* Before leaving , he took one last , _RARE_ look at the apartment . STO
* He knew he would never see it again . STO
* In the street , walking as quickly as he could , Stanley Gilborn was a lone figure . STO
* On Blanche _RARE_ , Kitti _RARE_ death had a quite different effect . STO
* For Blanche , _RARE_ death was a source of guilty , but nonetheless _RARE_ , happy hope . STO
* In _RARE_ defense , it must be said she was unaware of the _RARE_ hope . STO
* If anyone had asked her , she would have described herself only as nervous and worried . STO
* The figures on the _RARE_ paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter . STO
* She wondered whether Stanley would call . STO
* She wanted to be with him , to give him the comfort and _RARE_ she knew he needed . STO
* She had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out . STO
* He hadn't . STO
* And now she was feeling sick , both from concern about Stanley and hunger . STO
* Why hadn't he called ? STO
* Men , she reflected , even men like Stanley , are _RARE_ . STO
* She tried to think of his _RARE_ actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't so many after all . STO
* Stanley really was quite predictable . STO
* That was one of the things she liked about Stanley . STO
* He wasn't like so many other men . STO
* The dentist last night , for instance . STO
* _RARE_ and the movies had been fine . STO
* He had taken her upstairs to say good night . STO
* She had invited him in for coffee . STO
* It was in the kitchen , as she was watching the _RARE_ , waiting for the water to boil , that he had grabbed for her . STO
* Without warning , without giving her a chance to prepare for it . STO
* From behind , he had put his arms on her shoulders , turned her around , and pressed her to him , so close she couldn't breathe . STO
* Later , she _RARE_ for the long scratch across his face , tried to explain she couldn't help herself , that the panic arose in her unwanted . STO
* But he hadn't understood . STO
* When he left , she knew she would never see him again . STO
* Stanley wasn't like that . STO
* She could always _RARE_ what Stanley was going to do , ever since she first met him . STO
* _RARE_ for that one morning . STO
* The morning he walked in to announce to her , _RARE_ , that he was married . STO
* She thought she was going to die . STO
* She had assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him . STO
* Blanche couldn't remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion . STO
* She thought it was _RARE_ during the second week she worked for Stanley . STO
* It was nothing that he said or did , but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him , looking forward to his eventual proposal . STO
* She was _RARE_ years old then . STO
* Her mother was already considerably concerned over her _RARE_ future . STO
* But Blanche had been able to maintain a _RARE_ and assured _RARE_ in the face of her _RARE_ mother's continued _RARE_ , had been able to resist her _RARE_ to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of _RARE_ . STO
* For Blanche , it was only a matter of time before Stanley would propose . STO
* It was to be expected that Stanley would be shy , slow in taking such a _RARE_ step . STO
* Stanley went along in life , she knew , convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman . STO
* As a result , he never looked for it . STO
* But one day , she expected , he would somehow discover , without her having to tell him , that there was such a woman in the world ; ; a woman who was willing to give him love , faith , and anything else a woman could give a husband . STO
* Indeed , there was a woman who , _RARE_ , had already given him love . STO
* _RARE_ , Blanche loved Stanley . STO
* And then , unexpectedly , Stanley made his announcement . STO
* On that first day , Blanche literally thought she was going to die , or , at the very least , go out of her mind . STO
* It might have been easier for her if Kitti Walker hadn't been everything that Blanche was not . STO
* Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley , taller than Stanley , _RARE_ than Stanley had any right to hope for , much less expect . STO
* Kitti could have married a score of men . STO
* There was no reason for her to marry someone like Stanley Gilborn , there was no need for her to marry Stanley . STO
* Kitti had come into the office , on _RARE_ recommendation , because she needed help in preparing her income tax return . STO
* Stanley had filled out the return and because , when he was finished , it was close to the lunch hour , he had politely asked Kitti to join him , never expecting her to accept . STO
* Blanche knew all this because the door to _RARE_ office was open and , without straining too hard , she could hear everything that was said . STO
* Stanley had gone out , saying he would be back in an hour . STO
* He hadn't come back for over two . STO
* After that day , Blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened . STO
* There were mornings when Stanley came in late , afternoons when he left early , days when he didn't come in at all . STO
* Blanche knew something must be causing _RARE_ new , strange behavior but she never once connected it with Kitti Walker . STO
* It was too unprecedented . STO
* Then , six weeks after the day Kitti first came into the office , Stanley announced he and Kitti were married . STO
* Somehow , Blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her _RARE_ . STO
* That night the two of them left for a _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* While they were away Blanche came into the office every morning , running things as she had always run them for Stanley , going through the week in a _RARE_ _RARE_ , getting things done automatically , out of habit . STO
* For exactly one week , she was able to continue in this manner . STO
* On the morning of _RARE_ return , however , her strength left her . STO
* Two hours of watching his _RARE_ happy face , listening to his soft humming as he bent over his _RARE_ figures , and Blanche had to leave . STO
* She stayed away for ten days . STO
* Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known . STO
* _RARE_ , she stayed in bed . STO
* She didn't tell anyone , even her mother , what was wrong . STO
* She refused to have a doctor , _RARE_ there was nothing a doctor could do for her . STO
* `` Right '' , said the fingerprint man . STO
* `` Also , if you're going to believe those _RARE_ , you'll have to look for a killer who's a _RARE_ piano player '' . STO
* He demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano , doing a _RARE_ passage with a _RARE_ exaggerated attack . STO
* To make it clearer he shifted to acting out , but with no change of manner , the killing of Rose _RARE_ . STO
* His hands snatched at an imaginary bucket , _RARE_ down hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap like a ball that's been bounced hard . STO
* In the same way he _RARE_ _RARE_ a _RARE_ and bouncing _RARE_ off that , pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing _RARE_ off that . STO
* He was moving like a ballet _RARE_ , playing for _RARE_ . STO
* If Rose _RARE_ killer acted this way , _RARE_ up with him was going to be a _RARE_ . STO
* We'd know him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear _RARE_ in his hair . STO
* Perhaps if Felix had first come upon us when this boy was not _RARE_ so _RARE_ up and down the hall outside the murdered woman's apartment , we might have had less trouble _RARE_ Felix of our _RARE_ . STO
* This , you will remember , was still New _RARE_ Day . STO
* By the time Felix turned up it was early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small children and a few _RARE_ souls who had not yet _RARE_ up , it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's _RARE_ and paper hats . STO
* Felix was the exception . STO
* He had retained his hat and his horn , and , whatever fun might still be going , he was ready to join it . STO
* That , _RARE_ , might give you some idea of what Felix was like . STO
* After all , he hadn't happened upon us in that _RARE_ hall without warning . STO
* The _RARE_ boys had finished their _RARE_ examination and the body had been removed for _RARE_ . STO
* The meat wagon , therefore , was not out in front of the house any more , but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* There was , _RARE_ , the crowd of curious _RARE_ gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance . STO
* Just put yourself in _RARE_ place for a moment . STO
* You're a _RARE_ , _RARE_ , landlord . STO
* You've been away from home for the New _RARE_ _RARE_ , but now the party is over and you come home . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol _RARE_ and not yet eliminated from the system , you are sober . STO
* You still have your paper hat and you're wearing it , but then , it is an extraordinary paper hat and , in addition to anything else you may be , you are also the _RARE_ who created that most peculiar _RARE_ out in the back yard . STO
* It's not too much to assume that you will have a more _RARE_ interest in paper hats than will Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* You have your paper horn clutched in your big , _RARE_ fist , and for your entrance you have planned a _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ to your friends and tenants . STO
* You find your house a focus of public and police attention . STO
* Can you imagine yourself _RARE_ under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so _RARE_ _RARE_ and armed with a paper horn ? STO
* Maybe one could be startled into _RARE_ . STO
* You shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you _RARE_ up to the cop on the door . STO
* You identify yourself and ask him what's going on . STO
* Instead of answering you , he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs . STO
* `` Got the upstairs guy '' , he _RARE_ . STO
* `` The owner . STO
* Do I send him up '' ? STO
* Then he turns back to you . STO
* `` Go on in '' , he says . STO
* `` They'll tell you what's cooking '' . STO
* Even then , as you go into the house _RARE_ by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this _RARE_ , official control , could you go on _RARE_ that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand ? STO
* What I'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for _RARE_ being an odd one . STO
* We'd seen his _RARE_ out in the back yard , and the little his tenants had told us of him did make him sound a little special . STO
* We were not , however , prepared for anything like the _RARE_ that confronted us as Felix came up the stairs . STO
* He , of course , must have been equally _RARE_ for what confronted him , but , nonetheless , I did find his reaction startling . STO
* If Felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn because he'd forgotten about them , he now remembered . STO
* He came _RARE_ up the stairs and joined the dance . STO
* He adjusted the hat , lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a _RARE_ , and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to _RARE_ with him . STO
* Our man stopped dead and _RARE_ at Felix . STO
* Felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the _RARE_ of even that solidly built old house . STO
* This was a bull of a man . STO
* He was _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* His face was _RARE_ and heavy and _RARE_ , and when he laughed he showed his teeth , which were big and white and strong and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so _RARE_ not _RARE_ . STO
* His hair had _RARE_ most of the way to the back of his neck . STO
* He had only a _RARE_ of hair and he wore it _RARE_ short . STO
* It was almost as white as his teeth . STO
* For a man of his mass he was curiously short . STO
* He wasn't a _RARE_ but he was a bit of a comic figure . STO
* A man with so big and so _RARE_ developed a _RARE_ and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five . STO
* For Felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement . STO
* The man was just this side of being a _RARE_ . STO
* We waited till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him . STO
* He was dressed in a manner _RARE_ might suggest for the _RARE_ man's country weekend . STO
* Dark gray sports jacket , lighter gray slacks , pink _RARE_ shirt , black silk _RARE_ . STO
* His eyes were clear . STO
* He was _RARE_ shaved , and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed _RARE_ some scent of it on the massive _RARE_ of his laughter . STO
* Not even a _RARE_ . STO
* Eventually he _RARE_ . STO
* `` Felix '' ? STO
* Gibby said . STO
* `` Me '' , he said _RARE_ . STO
* `` Me , the happy one '' . STO
* `` That much Latin we remember '' , Gibby said _RARE_ . STO
* `` You always live up to your name , always like this , always making happy '' ? STO
* `` I try '' , Felix said _RARE_ . STO
* `` The world is full of _RARE_ who put their hearts into making the tragic scene . STO
* I've never noticed that it _RARE_ things any '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ for you '' , Gibby said . STO
* `` What's the rest of your name '' ? STO
* `` No rest of it . STO
* Felix is all there is '' . STO
* `` All there ever was '' ? STO
* `` The past I leave to _RARE_ '' , Felix _RARE_ , _RARE_ that he could be _RARE_ as well as happy . STO
* `` You live in the present '' ? STO
* `` In the present '' , Felix proclaimed . STO
* `` For the future . STO
* Is there any other time in which a man can live '' ? STO
* `` We '' , Gibby announced , `` are not _RARE_ . STO
* We are Assistant District _RARE_ . STO
* This gentleman is a police officer . STO
* He is a fingerprint _RARE_ . STO
* Could your future , your immediate future , be made to include taking us upstairs , giving us a bit of space in which our friend can work , and making available to him your finger tips '' ? STO
* The happy one could never have looked _RARE_ . STO
* This was more than joy . STO
* It was _RARE_ . STO
* `` Those lovely _RARE_ '' , he _RARE_ . STO
* `` So _RARE_ , so beautiful . STO
* Come right along . STO
* I love _RARE_ '' . STO
* He was _RARE_ along the hall , heading for the next flight of stairs . STO
* Gibby called him back . STO
* `` We're here because of what happened last night '' , he said . STO
* `` _RARE_ , yes , but important . STO
* Since it is important , for the record let's have the full name '' . STO
* `` That important '' ? STO
* Felix asked . STO
* `` That important '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Felix whispered . STO
* `` Felix _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Gibby asked , not bothering to whisper . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Felix _RARE_ . STO
* `` I can't see what would make it necessary for you to know . STO
* Nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world '' . STO
* _RARE_ Gibby lowered his voice . STO
* `` Felix _RARE_ '' ? STO
* He repeated . STO
* `` No . STO
* _RARE_ , but not for years . STO
* For years it's been just Felix . STO
* First thing I did after my _RARE_ birthday was go into court and have it officially changed , and this is something I don't tell everybody . STO
* That was almost forty years ago '' . STO
* Having _RARE_ that he was a man of about sixty , he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less _RARE_ . STO
* This was a _RARE_ of a boy , our Felix , and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in _RARE_ how _RARE_ he was and how full of juice and spirit . STO
* We followed him up the stairs . STO
* The cops would gather up _RARE_ and the _RARE_ on the third floor and bring us those of them who would _RARE_ submit to _RARE_ . STO
* You may think we didn't need _RARE_ and Jean , but you always get what you can when you can , and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were through with this case . STO
* Also , if we had excluded the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood . STO
* The killer , if in our present group , would certainly be interested in knowing that much , and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation , there might always be some way . STO
* If you can possibly avoid it , you don't hand out any extra chances . STO
* Felix took us into his studio . STO
* It was that oddly _RARE_ space at the very top of the house , where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope . STO
* At each angle of its pitch a big _RARE_ had been fitted into the roof and all these _RARE_ were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades . STO
* When Felix first opened the door on it , all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night . STO
* He quickly fixed that , rolling back the shades on some of the _RARE_ and adjusting screens on the others . STO
* He flew about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience . STO
* None of his movements was tentative . STO
* There was no process of trial and error . STO
* _RARE_ with the room completely _RARE_ out , as it was when we came in , he _RARE_ fixed things so that the whole place was _RARE_ in the maximum of light without at any point _RARE_ even so much as a crack of glare . STO
* _RARE_ something _RARE_ _RARE_ , I was surprised by what we found . STO
* There was no display of either works in progress or of finished work . STO
* Here and there on work table or _RARE_ stood a shape with a sheet or a _RARE_ draped over it . STO
* These shapes might have been mad , but there was no telling . STO
* They were all completely _RARE_ . STO
* The equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition . STO
* Everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the _RARE_ comfort , convenience and efficiency . STO
* There were tools about but they were neatly kept . STO
* There was no confusion and no _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of sheet metal were neatly stacked in _RARE_ . STO
* Andy did not see the newspapers the next day . STO
* Someone on his staff -- he suspected it was Ed Thornburg -- _RARE_ them and for this Andy was grateful . STO
* He finally fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping _RARE_ , a _RARE_ he rarely used , and didn't awaken until early afternoon . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling _RARE_ his stomach . STO
* Outside his window _RARE_ a beautiful summer day . STO
* _RARE_ the same sun was shining upon little Drew also , and those who had _RARE_ him . STO
* But where ? STO
* It was still a very big world , despite all the modern _RARE_ to the contrary . STO
* Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door . STO
* He was _RARE_ , perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten . STO
* He snapped to _RARE_ at _RARE_ entrance . STO
* `` _RARE_ , Mr. Paxton . STO
* Nothing new . STO
* _RARE_ of people waiting to see you , though '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Our own people . STO
* _RARE_ about the show tonight '' . STO
* Hub picked up the telephone . STO
* `` Shall I let them know you're awake '' ? STO
* `` I suppose . STO
* How's _RARE_ , do you know '' ? STO
* Hub considered . STO
* `` Some better . STO
* She's got plenty of guts , Mr. Paxton . STO
* You want me to call her '' ? STO
* `` She expecting me to '' ? STO
* Hub shook his head so Andy told him not to bother . STO
* The only reason for _RARE_ _RARE_ was to comfort or to be _RARE_ . STO
* He could not manage the former or expect the latter ; ; they had nothing to give to each other . STO
* The _RARE_ might look peculiar to outsiders , but Andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of _RARE_ . STO
* He had little time to himself , anyway . STO
* As the afternoon sped toward evening , the suite saw a steady _RARE_ of Paxton _RARE_ pass in and out , each with his own special problem . STO
* Thornburg arrived with the writers . STO
* They had spent the morning _RARE_ the act , eliminating all the gay songs , _RARE_ and dancing with a view of the best public relations . STO
* What remained lacked the original _RARE_ but it was at least dignified , as _RARE_ the tragic circumstances . STO
* Raymond _RARE_ reported that the orchestra had hastily _RARE_ `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' in case it was needed . STO
* Charlie _RARE_ was back and forth on several occasions , first to _RARE_ with Andy on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ engagement -- they decided it was wise -- and later to announce that a prominent _RARE_ , also an agency _RARE_ , had agreed to fill the _RARE_ open date . STO
* And once Bake slipped in , pale and drawn , last night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it . STO
* He asked if there was anything he could do . STO
* Andy _RARE_ a job to keep him busy , sending him ahead to _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ last minute arrangements . STO
* But from _RARE_ Vecchio , they heard nothing . STO
* At last it was time to _RARE_ . STO
* Hub , _RARE_ about , spotted reporters in the lobby , so Andy was _RARE_ away quietly through the _RARE_ service entrance in a strange car which Hub had _RARE_ somewhere . STO
* They succeeded in _RARE_ the curious at the hotel , but there was no chance of avoiding them at the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ was surrounded by a mob . STO
* They _RARE_ the parking lot , making progress by automobile difficult . STO
* Long before he reached the protection of the stage door , Andy was recognized . STO
* _RARE_ of his arrival spread through the crowd like a _RARE_ . STO
* They surged around him , fingers pointing , eyes _RARE_ . STO
* It was not a _RARE_ gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last night's _RARE_ . STO
* They had come not to _RARE_ but to observe . STO
* `` It's worse inside '' , Thornburg informed Andy . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ in every table he could find . STO
* Under the heading of it's an ill wind , et _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ was _RARE_ by contrast . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ kept their distance , _RARE_ by the _RARE_ . STO
* But in his dressing room was a large _RARE_ and a card that read , `` We're with you all the way '' . STO
* It was signed by everyone in the _RARE_ . STO
* Andy couldn't help but be touched . STO
* He instructed _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ a note of thanks to be _RARE_ on the call board . STO
* Bake was waiting to report that Lou _RARE_ had been _RARE_ up to the point where he could function efficiently . STO
* Andy gathered that this had been no small _RARE_ . STO
* Bake himself looked better ; ; any kind of job was better than brooding . STO
* Andy told him , `` Bake , I wish you'd talk to _RARE_ , see if some kind of p. _RARE_ system can be _RARE_ up outside . STO
* It's just barely possible with this crowd that the _RARE_ wasn't able to get a table . STO
* I wouldn't want him to miss the message '' . STO
* `` I'll try . STO
* _RARE_ isn't going to like it much , though , giving away what he should be selling '' . STO
* _RARE_ wasn't the only one who didn't care for _RARE_ scheme . STO
* A short time later , Lieutenant Bonner _RARE_ into the dressing room . STO
* `` I got a bone to pick with you , Mr. Paxton . STO
* It's those damn _RARE_ '' . STO
* Andy rolled up the revised _RARE_ he had been studying . STO
* `` What about them '' ? STO
* `` They're going to _RARE_ me up good . STO
* My men have been here all afternoon , setting up for this thing '' . STO
* Bonner explained that , with the _RARE_ cooperation , the police had occupied _RARE_ _RARE_ like a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ picture _RARE_ had been installed to film the audience , the _RARE_ list was being checked out name by name , and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot _RARE_ automobiles for a possible lead . STO
* However , it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside , even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose . STO
* `` I want you to have the _RARE_ taken out '' . STO
* Andy sighed . STO
* `` Seems like we're never going to see eye to eye , Lieutenant . STO
* Didn't they tell you what I wanted the p. _RARE_ system for '' ? STO
* `` Sure , I know . STO
* But it's such a long shot '' -- `` No longer than yours . STO
* What do you expect to get tonight , anyway ? STO
* You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces ? STO
* Or have a sign on his car that says , ' Here _RARE_ the Paxton _RARE_ ' '' ? STO
* Andy _RARE_ the _RARE_ in his fist . STO
* `` I can't stop you from doing what you think is right . STO
* But don't try to stop me , either '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Bonner said , `` you're going to ask us for help . STO
* I can hardly wait '' . STO
* `` What you don't understand is that I'm asking for it now '' . STO
* But Bonner _RARE_ , still full of ill will . STO
* He had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination ; ; he had to _RARE_ to routine , tested procedures . STO
* To act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness . STO
* But , admit or not , Bonner was helpless . STO
* The crime showed too much planning , the _RARE_ appeared too _RARE_ to be caught by a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock . STO
* He _RARE_ for a _RARE_ longer , hoping to hear something from Vecchio about the _RARE_ money . STO
* Bake and _RARE_ _RARE_ , on separate _RARE_ , could not reach him at any _RARE_ location in Los Angeles , nor could they secure any clear-cut information regarding his efforts . STO
* Bake cursed . STO
* `` The sweaty _RARE_ probably halfway to _RARE_ with our money by now '' . STO
* When no one smiled , he felt _RARE_ to add , `` Just kidding , _RARE_ '' . STO
* Thornburg _RARE_ in to _RARE_ , `` Andy , _RARE_ sending up smoke signals . STO
* You about ready '' ? STO
* `` What's he _RARE_ about '' ? STO
* Bake asked . STO
* `` They're drinking , aren't they '' ? STO
* `` No . STO
* We got a bunch of _RARE_ out there tonight . STO
* I guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything '' . STO
* Thornburg added in a lower voice but Andy _RARE_ , `` They act more like a jury than an audience '' . STO
* Andy said , `` Well , I guess we can't wait any longer . STO
* Hub , you stick by the stage door . STO
* If Rock shows up during the number -- or you hear anything -- give me the signal '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ said , `` I'll stay on the phone , Mr. Paxton . STO
* There's a couple of _RARE_ I can work on '' . STO
* `` You're a _RARE_ -- but leave one line open . STO
* He may try to phone us '' . STO
* Andy passed into the corridor , their `` good _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Following him . STO
* It was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different , as if he really needed it . STO
* They were right . STO
* The act , cut to shreds and hastily _RARE_ together during the afternoon , had not been _RARE_ sufficiently by anyone . STO
* The result had nothing of the _RARE_ , pace or _RARE_ of the previous night . STO
* Here's where luck would normally step in . STO
* But this was no ordinary show and Andy knew it . STO
* Whether he _RARE_ well or badly had nothing to do with it . STO
* The audience had come not to be _RARE_ but to judge . STO
* _RARE_ hours had changed him from a _RARE_ to a _RARE_ . STO
* Within this framework , what followed was strained , even _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ numbers left little but _RARE_ and other songs of equal _RARE_ . STO
* The effect was as _RARE_ as a _RARE_ , the applause _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Yet Andy plowed ahead , _RARE_ the _RARE_ words as if they possessed real meaning , and gradually his listeners warmed to him . STO
* Their clapping grew more _RARE_ ; ; the evening was still not beyond _RARE_ , not as a show but for him as a person . STO
* The worst was yet to come . STO
* As Andy reached the _RARE_ of his act , a subdued commotion _RARE_ drew his attention to the wings . STO
* _RARE_ Vecchio -- a _RARE_ , _RARE_ Vecchio -- was standing there , _RARE_ by two men in the uniforms of _RARE_ transport guards . STO
* Vecchio was _RARE_ and pointing at the large suitcase he held . STO
* Andy felt his heart _RARE_ heavily with relief . STO
* He waved at _RARE_ to cut off the _RARE_ introduction . STO
* The music died away _RARE_ . STO
* He drew a deep breath . STO
* `` _RARE_ and gentlemen , in place of my regular closing number tonight , I'd like to sing something of a different nature for you . STO
* Ray , if you please -- the ' _RARE_ _RARE_ ' '' . STO
* He sensed rather than heard the _RARE_ that swept across the audience . STO
* Nor could he blame them . STO
* This particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste , _RARE_ _RARE_ beyond the _RARE_ of decency . STO
* Having no choice , he plunged into it , anyway , holding onto the _RARE_ for support . STO
* `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* '' His voice shook . STO
* For the first time in his life he forgot the _RARE_ _RARE_ through and had to cover up by humming the rest . STO
* He wondered if the audience would let him finish . STO
* They did ; ; though _RARE_ , they were still _RARE_ . STO
* But when he was finally through , their _RARE_ was made apparent . STO
* Someone _RARE_ _RARE_ then quickly stopped . STO
* Otherwise , the silence was complete . STO
* As the lights came up , Andy could see that a number of _RARE_ were already on their way toward the exit . STO
* He stumbled _RARE_ . STO
* `` My God '' , he muttered . STO
* `` My God '' . STO
* Hub was there to support him . STO
* `` It's okay , Mr. Paxton . STO
* The _RARE_ here , all of it '' . STO
* At this moment , all he could think of was what he'd been forced to _RARE_ . STO
* `` Did you hear them ? STO
* Do you know what they think of me '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ of damn _RARE_ '' , Hub _RARE_ . STO
* `` Who needs them '' ? STO
* Thornburg patted his arm . STO
* `` Sure , Andy , it'll be all right . STO
* Nothing broken that can't be _RARE_ '' . STO
* The words were hollow . STO
* Thornburg knew , better than any of them , that a public image was as _RARE_ as _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* All the _RARE_ horses and all the _RARE_ men Vecchio _RARE_ in . STO
* `` I got it , Andy . STO
* God knows how , but I got it . STO
* You'll never believe the places I've been today . STO
* I practically had to sign your life away , you'll probably fire me for some of the deals I had to go for , but '' -- Andy nodded _RARE_ . STO
* `` It doesn't matter , Rock . STO
* We've done our part '' . STO
* He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room . STO
* The usual _RARE_ crowd was _RARE_ absent ; ; the place had the air of a _RARE_ . STO
* Andy had no desire to _RARE_ himself but Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to _RARE_ them . STO
* His son watched until he got as far as the hall , almost out of sight , then hurried after . STO
* `` Dad . STO
* Dad , wait '' . STO
* He caught up with the old man in the living room . STO
* Old man Arthur had put down the suitcase to open the front door . STO
* `` Just this one favor , Dad . STO
* Just don't tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours '' . STO
* `` Why not '' ? STO
* The old man gave the room a stare in leaving ; ; under the _RARE_ _RARE_ the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory . STO
* `` It's the truth '' . STO
* `` The _RARE_ girl was killed by Mr. _RARE_ son . STO
* _RARE_ and Ferguson have been across the street , talking to the kid . STO
* They've found some sort of new evidence , a bundle of clothes or something , and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime . STO
* Why won't you accept facts ? STO
* The two kids were together a lot , they were having some kind of _RARE_ affair -- God knows how far that had gone -- and the kid's _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ , and the man who hit you and took the cane , he _RARE_ . STO
* My God , how much more do you want '' ? STO
* His father looked him over closely . STO
* `` You sound like an old woman . STO
* You should have gone to work today , _RARE_ of _RARE_ around _RARE_ on the _RARE_ house '' . STO
* `` Now , see here '' -- `` The trouble with you '' , old man Arthur began , and then checked himself . STO
* Young Mrs. Arthur had opened the _RARE_ and there was a _RARE_ odor of hot biscuits . STO
* The old man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight . STO
* `` Isn't enough time to go into it '' , he finished , and slammed the door in his son's face . STO
* Mrs. Holden turned from the window _RARE_ . STO
* `` They found something else up there '' , she said _RARE_ to the empty room . STO
* `` They took it away , overalls or something '' . STO
* She walked _RARE_ across the room , then back to the windows . STO
* `` Now they've gone , they didn't come back , and they didn't arrest that _RARE_ boy '' . STO
* She stood frowning and chewing her lip . STO
* She was wearing a brown cotton dress , cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look _RARE_ , a _RARE_ set into the skirt and _RARE_ _RARE_ below . STO
* She smoothed the skirt , sat down , then stood up and went back to the windows . STO
* `` Why on earth did I send him off to work ? STO
* There was excuse enough to keep him home that young Mr. _RARE_ still over there '' . STO
* With sudden energy , she went to the phone and rang _RARE_ office and asked for him . STO
* `` I think you had better come home '' . STO
* `` Mae , we're so busy . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ been on _RARE_ neck , an order he expected didn't come through and he's '' -- `` I don't care . STO
* I want you here . STO
* I'm all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous . STO
* I need someone to go out and find out what's happening '' . STO
* `` But I couldn't do that , even if I were home '' ! STO
* His voice grew high and trembling . STO
* `` I can't be _RARE_ every time those cops turn around ! STO
* They'll they'll think I did something '' . STO
* He couldn't see the grin that split her mouth ; ; the teeth that _RARE_ into the phone were like a _RARE_ . STO
* `` You'll just have to risk it . STO
* You can't _RARE_ along in the dark , can you ? STO
* I'd think that you even more than I would be wondering what they're up to . STO
* They found some clothes '' , she tossed in . STO
* `` What '' ? STO
* _RARE_ , she ignored the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Also , that Mr. Ferguson was here . STO
* I guess he wants to ask you some questions . STO
* I _RARE_ him off . STO
* He doesn't expect you until five '' . STO
* `` Then I'd better wait until five '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* Come home right away '' . STO
* She slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped away . STO
* Her eyes were bright with anticipation . STO
* In his office , Mr. Holden replaced the phone slowly . STO
* He rose from his chair . STO
* He had to cough then ; ; he went to the window and _RARE_ there with the fresh breeze on his face . STO
* He got his hat out of the closet . STO
* For a moment he thought of going into _RARE_ office to explain that he had to leave , but there was now such a pain in his chest , such a _RARE_ in his head , that he decided to let it go . STO
* He passed the receptionist in the outer office , muttering , `` I've got to go out for a little while '' . STO
* Let her call _RARE_ if she wanted to , let _RARE_ raise the roof or even can him , he didn't care . STO
* He got into the car . STO
* _RARE_ the key into the switch , pressing the accelerator with his foot , putting the car into reverse , seemed vast _RARE_ almost beyond the ability of his shaking body . STO
* Once out in the street , the traffic was a _RARE_ _RARE_ in which he wandered _RARE_ . STO
* When he turned into the highway that led to the _RARE_ of the city and then rose toward home , he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes , sucking in air and _RARE_ and _RARE_ his eyes to clear them of tears . STO
* What on earth was in _RARE_ mind , that she wanted him up there _RARE_ on what the cops were doing ? STO
* What did she think he could do ? STO
* He tried to ignore what his own common sense told him , but it wasn't possible ; ; her motives were too _RARE_ . STO
* She wanted him to get into trouble . STO
* She wanted the police to notice him , suspect him . STO
* She was going to keep on _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , suggesting , and _RARE_ until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions . STO
* And he knew in that moment , with a cold _RARE_ of despair , a dying of old hopes , that Mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors . STO
* Nothing _RARE_ , open ; ; but enough . STO
* They'd have some _RARE_ to repeat to the police . STO
* Though his inner thoughts _RARE_ at it , he forced himself to think back , _RARE_ the scene in which Mae claimed to have caught him _RARE_ the child . STO
* It hadn't _RARE_ to anything . STO
* There had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions . STO
* A second scene flashed before his mind , the interior of the garage at the new house and the young _RARE_ girl turning startled to meet him , the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light . STO
* Suppose the cops somehow got hold of that ? STO
* Well , it hadn't been what it seemed , he'd had no idea the girl was in there . STO
* He hadn't touched her . STO
* And when he came to examine the scene , there was a certain _RARE_ to it , it had the smell of planning , and a swift suspicion darted into his mind . STO
* Too monstrous , of course . STO
* Mae wouldn't have plotted a thing like that . STO
* It was just that little _RARE_ played into her hands . STO
* Like this murder . STO
* He leaned on the wheel , clutching it , staring into the sunlight , and tried to bring order into his thoughts . STO
* He felt _RARE_ and sick . STO
* There was no use wandering off into a territory of _RARE_ nightmare . STO
* Mae was his wife . STO
* She was married to him for better or for worse . STO
* She wouldn't be _RARE_ planning his destruction . STO
* But she was . STO
* She was . STO
* Even as the conviction of truth roared through him , shattering his last hope of safety , he was reaching to release the hand _RARE_ , to head up the road for home , doing her bidding . STO
* He drove , and the road _RARE_ , familiar scenes crept past on either side . STO
* He came to a stretch of old orange _RARE_ , the trees dead , some of them _RARE_ , and then there was an _RARE_ shopping area , and tract houses . STO
* He had the feeling that he should _RARE_ the car and run off somewhere to hide . STO
* But he couldn't imagine where . STO
* There was really no place to go , finally , except home to Mae . STO
* At the gate he slowed , looking around . STO
* Cooper was beside his car , on the curb at the right , just standing there _RARE_ ; ; he didn't even look up . STO
* Behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man Arthur ; ; he was straight , something angry in his attitude , as if he might be waiting to report something . STO
* Holden stepped on the gas . STO
* A new idea drifted in from nowhere . STO
* He could go to the police . STO
* He could tell them his fears of being involved , he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how Mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him -- the scene was complete in his mind at the moment , even to his own _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and _RARE_ silent patience . STO
* He could throw himself on the mercy of the Police Department . STO
* It wasn't what Mae would want him to do , though . STO
* He was sure of this . STO
* Once he had abandoned himself to the very worst , once he had _RARE_ all the _RARE_ of worry and suspense , there wouldn't be very much for Mae to do . STO
* At that moment , Holden almost slammed on the _RARE_ to go back to Cooper and ask if Ferguson was about . STO
* It would be such a relief . STO
* What was that old sign , supposed to be painted over a door somewhere , _RARE_ hope , all _RARE_ who enter here ? STO
* Why , Holden said to himself , surprised at his own sudden _RARE_ , I'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be . STO
* They've worried , they've _RARE_ awake nights , they've shook at the slightest _RARE_ , they've _RARE_ their own destruction , and now it's all over and they can give up . STO
* Sure , they're giving up hope . STO
* Hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Holden waved a hand at the empty street . STO
* _RARE_ to see you go . STO
* He drove into the _RARE_ space before the garage and got out , _RARE_ the car door . STO
* He looked up and down the street . STO
* If _RARE_ car had been in sight , Holden would have walked directly to it . STO
* He went to the front door and opened it and looked in . STO
* Mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen . STO
* She had a cup of something _RARE_ , coffee perhaps , in one hand , a fresh piece of toast in the other . STO
* She stood there , watching Holden come in , and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge _RARE_ of her white teeth . STO
* `` Mae '' -- `` I've been thinking '' , she said , _RARE_ the toast . STO
* `` Didn't you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage ? STO
* You used them that time you painted the porch at our other house . STO
* And then you wiped up some grease '' . STO
* She had caught him off guard , no preparation , nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of _RARE_ . STO
* `` No . STO
* Wait a minute . STO
* What do you '' -- `` I've been looking for them , and they're gone . STO
* I'm sure they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago . STO
* Or even yesterday . STO
* You used to paint in them , and then you just took them for _RARE_ . STO
* The police have them now '' . STO
* `` I don't remember any overalls at all '' . STO
* `` They were all faded . STO
* _RARE_ through at the knees '' . STO
* She stood _RARE_ and chewing and watching . STO
* `` Green paint , wasn't it ? STO
* Well , I'm not sure of the color . STO
* But you had them '' . STO
* `` Mae , sit down . STO
* Put down the cup of coffee . STO
* Tell me what this is all about '' . STO
* She shook her head . STO
* She took another bite of toast . STO
* Holden noticed almost absently how she _RARE_ , how the whole side of her cheek moved , a slab of fat that extended down into her neck . STO
* `` My goodness , you ought to remember if I do . STO
* You're going to have to go to the police and explain what happened . STO
* Tell them the truth or something before they come here '' . STO
* A _RARE_ _RARE_ entered _RARE_ being ; ; his nerves seemed _RARE_ down to the tips of his _RARE_ fingers and his _RARE_ felt stiff and _RARE_ , _RARE_ to break like an _RARE_ at any moment . STO
* `` I've never owned any painting overalls . STO
* A man with a _RARE_ pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long , dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said , `` Is this more like it , Mrs. _RARE_ ? STO
* Or are the eyebrows more like this '' ? STO
* When he had finished with that , he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else , most probably a _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ to look like him now , would you say ? STO
* _RARE_ about the mouth , _RARE_ ? STO
* More like this , maybe '' ? STO
* Men blew dust on objects in a room on the _RARE_ floor of the Hotel Dumont and blew it off again , and did the same in a tiny , almost _RARE_ room in a _RARE_ in the West _RARE_ . STO
* And men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms , sucking dust up once more . STO
* Men from the Third _RARE_ District , _RARE_ _RARE_ , had the _RARE_ , the most _RARE_ , job . STO
* At the Hotel Dumont there had , at the time in issue , been twenty-three _RARE_ , counting couples as singular . STO
* These included , as one , Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Payne , who had checked in a little after noon the day before , and had not checked out together . STO
* But _RARE_ Willings was not included ; ; he had been at the Dumont for almost a week . STO
* There was , of course , no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel . STO
* The twenty-three ( or _RARE_ with the _RARE_ themselves omitted ) provided merely a place to start , and their identification was the _RARE_ of starts . STO
* With names and addresses listed , _RARE_ came next . STO
* It would take time ; ; it would , almost inevitably , trouble some water . STO
* ( `` I certainly was not at the Dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been . STO
* He's in Boston . STO
* Of course he's in '' -- ) The Hotel King Arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems . STO
* The King Arthur offered respectable and convenient _RARE_ to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want -- heaven knew didn't want ! STO
* -- to _RARE_ anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and , at odd hours of night , drive from smaller stations to distant homes , probably through rain or , in November , something worse . STO
* The King Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont . STO
* The King Arthur had _RARE_ _RARE_ , again counting rooms rather than people . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ out . STO
* _RARE_ to find what was wanted , as was most likely , check out other guests , with special -- but not exclusive -- attention to those with rooms on the street . STO
* ( _RARE_ active enough can reach a roof , wherever his room may be . STO
* ) And know , while all this went on , that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel . STO
* It was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel . STO
* There were other _RARE_ , less convenient but not impossible . STO
* It is dull business , _RARE_ , and hard on feet . STO
* There was also the one _RARE_ question to ask , and ask widely : Did you notice anything out of the way ? STO
* Like , for example , a man carrying a _RARE_ rifle , probably with a _RARE_ sight attached ? STO
* There was , of course , no hope it really would be that simple . STO
* The _RARE_ , whether _RARE_ marksman or murderer by intent , would hardly have walked to his _RARE_ point with rifle over shoulder , _RARE_ a marching tune . STO
* _RARE_ carrying anything that might hide a rifle ? STO
* Long thin suitcase ? STO
* Or long fat suitcase , for that matter ? STO
* _RARE_ met that , from room _RARE_ , from _RARE_ . STO
* Who measures ? STO
* But nothing , it appeared , long enough to attract attention . STO
* _RARE_ , say , for musical instruments ? STO
* None noted at the Dumont . STO
* Several at the King Arthur . STO
* A _RARE_ was staying there . STO
* And had been for a week . STO
* Anything else ? STO
* Anything at all ? STO
* _RARE_ met that . STO
* ( _RARE_ Pearson , _RARE_ _RARE_ , thought for a time he might be on to something . STO
* A refuse _RARE_ at the Dumont turned up a _RARE_ box -- a very long box for very _RARE_ flowers . STO
* _RARE_ of oil on green tissue ? STO
* The _RARE_ to check . STO
* The _RARE_ : sorry . STO
* No oil . STO
* ) Anything at all strange ? STO
* Well , a man had tried , at the King Arthur , to register with an _RARE_ . STO
* At the Dumont , a guest had come in a _RARE_ wheel chair . STO
* At the King Arthur one guest had had his head heavily _RARE_ , and another had a _RARE_ foot and had walked with _RARE_ . STO
* There had also been a man who must have had St. _RARE_ or something , because he kept _RARE_ his head . STO
* As reports _RARE_ in , William _RARE_ tossed them into the _RARE_ which had become his head . STO
* Mullins came in . STO
* There was no sign of Mrs. Lauren Payne at her house on _RARE_ Road , _RARE_ , Connecticut . STO
* The house was modern , large , on five acres . STO
* _RARE_ have cost plenty . STO
* The State cops would check from time to time ; ; pass word when there was word to pass . STO
* _RARE_ tossed this news into the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ things out , damn it . STO
* _RARE_ out the next move . STO
* Try to forget motive for the moment . STO
* Consider opportunity . STO
* Only those actually with Payne when he was shot , or who had left the party within not more than five minutes ( make five arbitrary ) positively had none . STO
* The _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ publicity director ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ , producer of _RARE_ . STO
* They had been with Payne when he was shot , could not therefore have shot him from above . STO
* Take _RARE_ Willings . STO
* He had left after the _RARE_ ; ; had been seen to leave . STO
* He would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey . STO
* Consider him seriously , therefore ? STO
* _RARE_ entered , then -- _RARE_ which felt like facts . STO
* Willings would ambush , certainly ; ; Willings undoubtedly had . STO
* Willings was , presumably , a better than average shot . STO
* But -- hunch , now -- Willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four . STO
* Because , if for no other reason , Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger , _RARE_ , than anything else that went on two legs . STO
* _RARE_ are laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ had had to `` go on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone on . STO
* To be checked out further . STO
* _RARE_ motive ? STO
* No , motive is a part of fact . STO
* Nobody in his right mind _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ simply do not keep that well in a _RARE_ mind . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ had accomplished much in a quarter of a century . STO
* _RARE_ it now to correct so old a wrong ? STO
* Bill shook his head . STO
* Also , he thought , I doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a _RARE_ . STO
* Lauren herself ? STO
* She had left the party early , pleading a _RARE_ . STO
* No lack of opportunity , _RARE_ she had a gun . STO
* She might , _RARE_ , have brought one in in a _RARE_ suitcase . STO
* ( _RARE_ on the Payne luggage . STO
* ) She might now have taken it away again . STO
* _RARE_ -- her husband wandering ? STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* Heaven knew it happened and hell knew it too . STO
* But -- it happened , almost always , among the primitive and , usually , among the very young . STO
* ( Call it mentally young ; ; call it _RARE_ . STO
* ) There was nothing to indicate that Lauren Payne was primitive . STO
* She did not move in primitive circles . STO
* She was young , but not that young . STO
* It occurred to Bill _RARE_ that he was , on a hunch basis , eliminating a good many . STO
* He reminded himself that all _RARE_ were tentative . STO
* He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities . STO
* The _RARE_ , mother or son , or mother and son ? STO
* _RARE_ was obvious . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Here , too , the cause to hate lay well back in the years . STO
* But bitterness had more cause to remain , even increasingly to _RARE_ . STO
* With the boy , particularly . STO
* The boy had , apparently -- if Mrs. _RARE_ was right in what she had told Mullins -- only in recent months been forced to give up college , to work as a _RARE_ . STO
* Seeing the man he _RARE_ for this made much of -- youth and bitterness and -- Bill picked up the telephone ; ; got Mullins . STO
* `` _RARE_ out a pickup on Mrs. Mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on '' , Bill said . STO
* `` Right '' ? STO
* Mullins would do . STO
* A man named _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , had expressed a wish that Anthony Payne drop dead . STO
* He would say , of course , that he had not really had any such wish ; ; that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say , lightly , meaning nothing . STO
* Which probably would turn out to be true ; ; which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say . STO
* A man named _RARE_ _RARE_ , with `` _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ '' but pronounced without them , had been fired at _RARE_ insistence . STO
* He was also , if Pam North was right , a closer _RARE_ of Lauren _RARE_ than she , now , was inclined to admit . STO
* He might deny the latter ; ; would certainly deny any connection between the two things , or any connection of either with murder . STO
* He would have to be given the opportunity . STO
* Mullins ? STO
* It was evident that Mullins was the man to go . STO
* It was evident that a captain should remain at his desk , _RARE_ with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat . STO
* Bill _RARE_ was good and tired of the wall opposite , and the crack in the plaster . STO
* Let Mullins keep the firm seat ; ; let _RARE_ . STO
* When _RARE_ cats are _RARE_ it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ , on _RARE_ bed , appeared to be one cat -- rather large , as _RARE_ cats go , and , to be sure , having two heads and two tails . STO
* On the other hand , they , or it , seemed to have no legs whatever . STO
* Pamela North said , `` Hi '' , to her cats , and added that proper cats met their humans at the door . STO
* Of four dark brown ears , one _RARE_ slightly at this . STO
* `` All right '' , Pam said . STO
* `` I know it isn't _RARE_ '' . STO
* But at this the one _RARE_ cat suddenly became two cats , stretching . STO
* _RARE_ , the more _RARE_ , began at once to talk , her voice _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , a more direct cat , leaped from the bed and _RARE_ _RARE_ toward the kitchen . STO
* _RARE_ looked surprised , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ after her . STO
* The hell it isn't _RARE_ , two waving tails told Pam North . STO
* It was not , whatever tale was told by tails . STO
* _RARE_ presumably would cope . STO
* She might be firm . STO
* It was most unlikely that she would be firm . STO
* They want to be fat cats , Pam thought , and lighted a cigarette and leaned back on a _RARE_ and considered pulling her thoughts together . STO
* After a time , it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble . STO
* A vague feeling that Anthony Payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was , in any event , _RARE_ . STO
* Had _RARE_ _RARE_ explanation of her confidence , so _RARE_ , been a little thin ? STO
* That was more like a thought , but not a great deal more . STO
* Had that tall dark boy , carrying _RARE_ too heavy for him , found what he might have considered _RARE_ of a man he probably hated more than he could bear ? STO
* And possessed himself -- how ? STO
* -- of a rifle and killed ? STO
* Pam found she had no answers ; ; had only a hope . STO
* The poor kid -- the poor , frail kid . STO
* Some people have luck and some have no luck and that , whatever people who prefer order say , is the size of it . STO
* The poor , _RARE_ -- The telephone rang . STO
* Pam realized , to her surprise , that she had been almost _RARE_ . STO
* At four o'clock in the afternoon . STO
* Two _RARE_ for lunch -- that was the trouble . STO
* I ought to remember . STO
* Don't pretend . STO
* You do remember . STO
* You just -- `` Hello ? STO
* Yes , this is she ? STO
* What '' ? STO
* The voice had music in it . STO
* Even with words coming too fast , they came on the music of the voice . STO
* `` I said I would '' , Pam said . STO
* `` They won't talk about who gave the information . STO
* Not unless they have to . STO
* They don't , Mrs. _RARE_ . STO
* Not unless they have '' -- She was interrupted . STO
* `` Call this a cry for help '' , _RARE_ _RARE_ said . STO
* `` Through a door _RARE_ unlocked '' , Madden _RARE_ . STO
* `` That damn door '' , said the police chief . STO
* `` A gift horse to be viewed with suspicion '' . STO
* _RARE_ dark face wore a _RARE_ look . STO
* `` If there was _RARE_ between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later . STO
* And it makes a very poor red _RARE_ for an inside job . STO
* Much better to break a cellar window '' . STO
* `` Don't forget , there was the hope it would pass for a natural death '' , Pauling reminded him . STO
* `` Well , with a house as big as that there must be at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation '' . STO
* `` Yeah . STO
* And a _RARE_ of glass isn't hard to '' -- The telephone interrupted him . STO
* He _RARE_ up the receiver and said , `` Police chief '' , into the mouthpiece , and then , `` Oh yes , Mr. Benson . STO
* I was hoping I'd hear from you today '' . STO
* With his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened , saying , `` _RARE_ '' and `` I see '' at intervals . STO
* At last he said , `` Well , thank you for calling , Mr. Benson . STO
* Although there was no doubt in my mind and we've been handling it as one I'm glad to have it made official '' . STO
* He hung up . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , he said to Madden . STO
* `` He's just heard from the _RARE_ who says Mrs. Meeker apparently died from _RARE_ '' . STO
* Pauling looked at his notes . STO
* `` Many minute _RARE_ in the lungs ; ; particles of _RARE_ and thread in the mouth and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ from the bed _RARE_ identical with the _RARE_ and thread found in the _RARE_ and oral _RARE_ . STO
* No other cause of death apparent . STO
* _RARE_ clear of _RARE_ and foreign objects . STO
* _RARE_ examined for _RARE_ , _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* No signs of these , no gross _RARE_ of lungs , heart , brain or stomach '' . STO
* He paused . STO
* `` That's about it . STO
* Oh , the time of death . STO
* The duration of the _RARE_ process varies , the _RARE_ says , but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper _RARE_ tract indicate that Mrs. Meeker died several hours after her _RARE_ dinner . STO
* Probably around midnight , give or take an hour either way '' . STO
* Pauling paused again . STO
* `` So there it is '' , he said . STO
* `` Not your problem , of course , unless Johnston and the murderer are one and the same '' . STO
* They discussed this possibility . STO
* However likely it was , Pauling said , he couldn't limit himself to it . STO
* He had to look for other prospects , other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to Johnston came to light . STO
* Madden , with his investigation centered on the fraud , said that tomorrow he would go to the _RARE_ bank through which Mrs. Meeker's checks to Johnston had cleared . STO
* Arthur Williams had to be located , they agreed . STO
* He might have been in _RARE_ with Johnston on the fraud ; ; he might be Mrs. Meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death . STO
* This was _RARE_ suggestion ; ; the police chief shook his head over it . STO
* If Arthur Williams was involved in the fraud or the murder , then he too had another identity . STO
* No one the _RARE_ police had questioned _RARE_ to know any more about him than about Johnston . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* Pauling looked doubtful . STO
* Madden explained that he was thinking of an application sent directly to Mrs. Meeker . STO
* Then he asked to use the phone and called Brian Thayer , who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o'clock . STO
* Madden said that he would see him at two and made another call , this one to Mrs. Meeker's lawyers . STO
* Mr. Hohlbein was out for the day , but Mr. Garth would be free at _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a _RARE_ for which Madden should be duly grateful . STO
* He _RARE_ that Hohlbein and Garth were _RARE_ lawyers . STO
* He had lunch with Pauling . STO
* _RARE_ at _RARE_ he entered Hohlbein and Garth's _RARE_ suite of offices in _RARE_ _RARE_ professional building . STO
* He disliked Garth on sight , conservative clothes and _RARE_ , smile a shade too earnestly _RARE_ for a man who must be well into his _RARE_ , _RARE_ too consciously quick and firm . STO
* _RARE_ man on the make , Madden labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm had political _RARE_ ; ; that Mrs. Garth would be _RARE_ suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; ; that there were three children , two boys and a girl ; ; that she was active in the _RARE_ Club and he in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ ; ; and finally , that neither of them had _RARE_ an _RARE_ opinion since their wedding day . STO
* Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also knew that he would go right on _RARE_ Garth . STO
* Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with _RARE_ distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come about if Mrs. Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr. Hohlbein or him about it . STO
* Madden _RARE_ not being able to find fault with so true a statement . STO
* He asked to see a copy of Mrs. Meeker's will . STO
* Garth brought one out . STO
* The date , October 8 , 1957 , immediately caught the _RARE_ eye . STO
* `` _RARE_ recent '' , he remarked . STO
* `` Was she in the habit of making new _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Oh no . STO
* She had reason to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker's death . STO
* Her estate had grown considerably . STO
* She wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most ; ; particularly the scholarship fund . STO
* At the time the will was drawn Mr. Hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age , knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth '' . STO
* Garth hesitated . STO
* `` Mr. Hohlbein and I have noticed some _RARE_ since , though . STO
* Most of them this past year , I'd say . STO
* Even two or three years ago I doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate Johnston affair . STO
* She'd have consulted us , you see . STO
* She always did before , and showed the _RARE_ confidence in whatever we advised '' . STO
* The _RARE_ nodded , _RARE_ this . STO
* Mrs. Meeker hadn't struck him as ready to seek _RARE_ advice , least of all Garth's . STO
* With her sharp tongue she'd have cut his _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* It would have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs . STO
* Madden settled back to read the will . STO
* He _RARE_ over the millions that went to Meeker _RARE_ , _RARE_ Hospital , the civic center , the Public Health _RARE_ Association , the library , and so on , _RARE_ when he came to the scholarship fund . STO
* Two millions were added to what had been set aside for it in Mrs. Meeker's _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ made that as long as Brian Thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustees ( hereinafter appointed by the bank _RARE_ the estate ) he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary _RARE_ with the increased responsibilities _RARE_ of the fund would _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ vote of confidence in Thayer , Madden reflected . STO
* _RARE_ , too . STO
* Very nice for him . STO
* He went on to personal _RARE_ , a list of names largely unknown to him . STO
* _RARE_ thousand to each of the _RARE_ in _RARE_ ( not much to blood relatives out of millions ) ten thousand to this friend and that , five thousand to another ; ; to Brian Thayer , the sum of ten thousand dollars ; ; to the _RARE_ , ten thousand each ; ; to Joan _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in Mrs. Meeker's _RARE_ at the time of the _RARE_ death . STO
* ( No additional five thousand for each year after _RARE_ _RARE_ birthday ; ; Mrs. Meeker hadn't got around to taking care of that . STO
* ) Too bad , Madden thought . STO
* Joan _RARE_ had earned the larger _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. Hohlbein was left twenty thousand , Garth ten . STO
* There were no other names Madden recognized . STO
* Arthur _RARE_ might well have been included , he felt . STO
* Mrs. Meeker had spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death , and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers . STO
* Madden took up this point with Garth , who shrugged it off . STO
* `` Old people have their _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` This one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more . STO
* `` Well , she had a number of them where money was concerned '' , Garth said . STO
* `` Sometimes we'd have trouble _RARE_ her to make _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and I've known her to quarrel with a _RARE_ over a bill for fixing a _RARE_ ; ; the next moment she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as _RARE_ as this unfortunate Johnston affair . STO
* There was no telling how she'd react to spending money '' . STO
* Madden inquired next about the _RARE_ of the scholarship fund . STO
* There was an annual _RARE_ , Garth informed him . STO
* No _RARE_ or _RARE_ had ever been found . STO
* Brian Thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator . STO
* His salary had reached the ten thousand mark . STO
* His expenses ran another four or five thousand . STO
* The lawyer didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party -- Thayer , like himself , Madden reflected , was the extra man so _RARE_ by _RARE_ -- and found him easy enough to talk to . STO
* But he didn't play golf , didn't seem to belong to any local _RARE_ -- his work took him away a lot , of course -- which probably _RARE_ for his tendency to keep to himself . STO
* Garth's glance began to _RARE_ to his watch . STO
* He said that he had already told the police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs. Meeker . STO
* He would offer no theory to account for her murder . STO
* The whole thing , his manner _RARE_ , was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug . STO
* No doubt Mrs. Meeker had _RARE_ him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing . STO
* Even so , _RARE_ dislike of the _RARE_ , correct lawyer _RARE_ . STO
* It would be all right with him , he decided , if his investigation of the fraud , with its probable _RARE_ of murder , led to Garth's door . STO
* _RARE_ ? STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* At first glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; ; but for all his air of _RARE_ , who could tell what his private financial picture was ? STO
* The _RARE_ knew as he left that this was _RARE_ thinking . STO
* Nevertheless , he made a mental note to look into Garth's financial background . STO
* Brian Thayer had a downtown address . STO
* He lived in an apartment house not over three or four years old , a _RARE_ island of _RARE_ brick and glass on the _RARE_ of the business district . STO
* He occupied a _RARE_ apartment on the fourth floor , using the second bedroom as his office . STO
* _RARE_ and bright , the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ by a professional _RARE_ , Madden thought , and somehow as _RARE_ , as _RARE_ as its _RARE_ . STO
* In _RARE_ the rent would run close to two hundred a month ; ; in _RARE_ , perhaps twenty-five less , not all of it paid by Thayer , who could charge off one room on his expense account . STO
* He took Madden into the room he used as an office . STO
* It contained a desk , files , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather _RARE_ . STO
* A newspaper open at _RARE_ reports lay on one of them . STO
* Thayer folded it up and offered a drink . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* To begin the interview , he asked if Thayer , with more time to think it over , could add to what he had said the other day about Johnston . STO
* Thayer shook his head . STO
* `` It's all I think about , too . STO
* That and her death . STO
* It's still _RARE_ that it was murder . STO
* For all her _RARE_ ways , I can't conceive of her having had a deadly enemy '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , Phil , are you trying to wreck my career ? STO
* Because that's what you're doing -- _RARE_ it , _RARE_ it , _RARE_ it '' ! STO
* Griffith had confronted Hoag on the _RARE_ front steps -- Hoag had been permitted no further -- and backed him against a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* His rage had built up as he made his way here from the second floor , helped by the quantity of champagne he had _RARE_ . STO
* Hoag said , `` I didn't send for you , _RARE_ . STO
* I want the captain in charge . STO
* Where is he '' ? STO
* `` Phil , for God's sake , go away . STO
* The _RARE_ in there . STO
* I told you there's nothing between _RARE_ and me , nothing . STO
* It's all in your mind '' . STO
* A couple of _RARE_ escaped him , followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state . STO
* `` Why , I'm not fit to touch the _RARE_ of her garment '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , get a grip on yourself . STO
* It's not about you or _RARE_ . STO
* I have some security information about the prime minister '' . STO
* Griffith looked at him _RARE_ through _RARE_ eyes . STO
* `` Not about me ? STO
* You mean it , Phil ? STO
* You wouldn't pull my leg , old man ? STO
* I did get you on the platform this morning '' . STO
* `` I'm not pulling your leg . STO
* Will you call that captain '' ? STO
* `` No use , he won't come '' . STO
* He peered closely at Hoag in the gathering darkness . STO
* `` What happened to your head '' ? STO
* `` I was hit -- knocked out . STO
* Now will you get him '' ? STO
* `` He says I'm to take the message '' . STO
* He stared at Hoag _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ hit you in the head '' ? STO
* `` It doesn't matter . STO
* You get back to the captain and tell him this : _RARE_ going to take a shot at the prime minister , and Mahzeer is in on the plot . STO
* Tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with Mahzeer '' . STO
* Griffith said , `` That's impossible . STO
* Mahzeer's the ambassador '' . STO
* `` Nevertheless it's true '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* Griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne _RARE_ that _RARE_ it . STO
* `` I'll show you how wrong you are . STO
* Mahzeer and the prime minister are alone right now '' . STO
* He nodded triumphantly . STO
* `` So that proves it '' ! STO
* Hoag looked _RARE_ . STO
* `` Where are they '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ you expect , the _RARE_ ? STO
* Mahzeer's office '' . STO
* `` Where is that '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ us , two flights up . STO
* Look , old man , you can't go up . STO
* They won't even let you in the front door . STO
* So why don't you be a good boy and '' -- Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders . STO
* `` Listen to me , _RARE_ . STO
* If you want to spend another day in the State Department -- another day -- you get in there and tell that captain what I told you '' . STO
* He bit out the words . STO
* `` And you know I can do it '' . STO
* Griffith raised _RARE_ hands . STO
* `` _RARE_ does it , Phil . STO
* I was just going . STO
* I'm on my way '' . STO
* He turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back . STO
* On the second landing he paused to look for Docherty , didn't see him , and accepted a glass of champagne . STO
* He took several large _RARE_ , _RARE_ that Docherty had gone up another flight , and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him . STO
* The way Hoag was , no telling what he might say or do . STO
* He finished his champagne and climbed _RARE_ to the next landing . STO
* At the top a _RARE_ officer blocked further progress . STO
* `` Yes , what is it '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` I want Captain Docherty '' . STO
* He spotted Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him . STO
* Docherty said , `` It's okay , _RARE_ , let him by '' . STO
* They walked toward each other . STO
* `` Well '' ? STO
* Griffith said , `` Hoag told me to tell you '' -- he waited until they were close ; ; it was _RARE_ _RARE_ -- `` not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer '' . STO
* Griffith looked _RARE_ to the captain ; ; it would be just like him . STO
* `` Why not '' ? STO
* `` He claims Mahzeer's in a plot to kill the _RARE_ '' . STO
* Docherty went taut : was it possible ? STO
* Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared ? STO
* Not possible , he thought ; ; the prime minister knew who his enemy was here ; ; he wasn't going to allow himself to be led _RARE_ to the _RARE_ . STO
* And if by some wild chance Mahzeer was the man , he wouldn't dare try anything now -- not after Docherty had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well . STO
* Docherty was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry truck . STO
* One more _RARE_ play like that one and they'd be leading him away . STO
* Still , this had to be checked out . STO
* `` _RARE_ your friend Hoag get his information '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` _RARE_ the _RARE_ , Captain '' . STO
* `` Would you mind sending him up here ? STO
* I'd like to talk to him '' . STO
* _RARE_ , he continued along the corridor , _RARE_ his head into the next office for a careful look around . STO
* But Hoag had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building . STO
* He was _RARE_ to rely on _RARE_ carrying his message , and he had no confidence the police would act on it . STO
* If Mahzeer was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while Hoag stood out here shivering in the _RARE_ street . STO
* He would have to do something on his own . STO
* But what ? STO
* The door opened and three men and a woman in a _RARE_ swept past him and down the stairs . STO
* In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their _RARE_ . STO
* These were the early _RARE_ ; ; in half an hour the reception would be over . STO
* If Mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for Muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes . STO
* Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building . STO
* _RARE_ windows with many small _RARE_ _RARE_ swept across the upper stories . STO
* On the second floor he saw the _RARE_ faces of the party guests ; ; the scene looked like a Christmas card . STO
* On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted ; ; it was framed in _RARE_ _RARE_ , and no faces were visible . STO
* This would be Mahzeer's office . STO
* He and the prime minister would be back from the window , seated at Mahzeer's desk ; ; they would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting . STO
* In a minute , or five minutes , the business would be done ; ; Mahzeer would stand up , the prime minister would follow . STO
* Mahzeer would direct the prime _RARE_ attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side . STO
* The single shot would come ; ; Hoag would carry its sound to his grave . STO
* Mahzeer , of course , would be _RARE_ . STO
* How was he to suspect that an assassin had been _RARE_ somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance ? STO
* Hoag turned . STO
* Where across the street ? STO
* Where was Muller waiting with the rifle ? STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf . STO
* Most of them could be eliminated ; ; _RARE_ would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite . STO
* The _RARE_ was _RARE_ set back from the building line ; ; if the angle of fire were too great the _RARE_ buildings on either side would interfere . STO
* Would the shot come from a roof ? STO
* He ran his eye along the roof _RARE_ ; ; almost at once a figure _RARE_ up . STO
* But _RARE_ _RARE_ on the dark form were the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of a policeman . STO
* With a cop _RARE_ the road Muller would have to be inside a building -- if he was here at all , and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at La _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Hoag crossed the narrow street , _RARE_ between parked cars to reach the sidewalk . STO
* From this side he could see farther into the _RARE_ _RARE_ window , but he saw no faces ; ; the _RARE_ occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain . STO
* If only the latter were true . STO
* He walked rapidly along the buildings _RARE_ their _RARE_ : one was a club -- that was out ; ; two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted . STO
* That left three , possibly four , one looking much like the next . STO
* He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the _RARE_ . STO
* He quickly closed it again . STO
* He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the hall _RARE_ , was obviously still a functioning town house , and its owners were in residence ; ; that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance . STO
* He went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the _RARE_ cooking _RARE_ of a public _RARE_ . STO
* On one wall was the brass front of a row of _RARE_ ; ; there were six apartments . STO
* Now what ? STO
* The names on the _RARE_ meant nothing to him . STO
* This was _RARE_ -- he had no idea what to look for . STO
* He peered in the boxes themselves ; ; all were empty except one , and that one was _RARE_ with letters and magazines . STO
* The occupants of _RARE_ _RARE_ 3 were probably away for a few days , and not likely to return on a Friday . STO
* Had Muller made the same deduction ? STO
* Muller was attracted to the lore of _RARE_ . STO
* He opened the inner door ; ; the cooking odors were stronger -- all over the city , at this hour , _RARE_ would be _RARE_ over _RARE_ . STO
* He climbed , as quickly as he could urge his body , up the two _RARE_ flights to the third floor , pulling himself along on a delicate _RARE_ , all that remained of the _RARE_ beauty . STO
* He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead . STO
* Now he was certain : the lock had not yielded to _RARE_ collection of keys ; ; fresh scars showed that the door had been _RARE_ open . STO
* It had been shut again , but the lock was broken ; ; he noted with a _RARE_ of fear that the door moved under his touch . STO
* What was he to do now ? STO
* He had thought no further than finding Muller . STO
* He realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find him -- that Muller would not be here , that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond _RARE_ control . STO
* He could not break in on an armed man . STO
* He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop . STO
* Was there time ? STO
* His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door . STO
* Hoag pushed open the door : at the far end of the long dark room Muller was faintly _RARE_ against the window , the rifle still raised ; ; he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the _RARE_ . STO
* He turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight , _RARE_ Hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at _RARE_ apartment . STO
* Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch : evil _RARE_ in the dark . STO
* The room was _RARE_ in light at the instant _RARE_ second shot came . STO
* Muller , _RARE_ exposed at the bright window like a _RARE_ _RARE_ in a car's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; ; his face wore a look of _RARE_ . STO
* A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; ; a following _RARE_ of shots shattered glass , _RARE_ the ceiling , and sent him _RARE_ heavily from the table . STO
* He was dead before his body made contact with the floor . STO
* Hoag stumbled back into the hall , leaned against the wall , and started to _RARE_ . STO
* After Captain Docherty sent _RARE_ Griffith for Hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before Griffith returned , _RARE_ up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne . STO
* The safe at _RARE_ District _RARE_ stands next to the _RARE_ machine in a narrow _RARE_ that leads to Captain _RARE_ office ( to the left ) , the _RARE_ office ( farther along and to the left ) and the _RARE_ supply closet ( straight ahead ) . STO
* The safe is a _RARE_ for three dead flashlight _RARE_ , a hundred and fifty _RARE_ _RARE_ fingerprint cards , a stack of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ tickets from last year , and _RARE_ cents in _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Gun set the captain's fifth of _RARE_ Walker inside the safe before he reported to _RARE_ Killpath , though he knew that Killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any _RARE_ _RARE_ on _RARE_ _RARE_ gift . STO
* It was more a matter of _RARE_ , and also it was none of Killpath's _RARE_ business . STO
* He walked up to the _RARE_ office , leaned wearily against the gun rack that _RARE_ four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a _RARE_ gun that was occasionally tried out on the Academy _RARE_ . STO
* He stared at the clerk who sat at a _RARE_ and ancient _RARE_ desk _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ the _RARE_ '' ? STO
* The clerk _RARE_ his head toward the captain's office . STO
* Gun went to the _RARE_ door , which was open , and stood at attention while _RARE_ _RARE_ Killpath , in full uniform , finished _RARE_ his hair . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ brown hair was heavily _RARE_ , and as Killpath _RARE_ the comb through it , it stuck together in _RARE_ so that it looked like _RARE_ ribs _RARE_ to his pink _RARE_ . STO
* The lieutenant eyed _RARE_ reflection in the mirror over the _RARE_ and then glanced back at his own face , moving the comb methodically around his head . STO
* Leave me alone , Gun thought . STO
* _RARE_ with Sam _RARE_ , fight with the whole damned Bureau . STO
* But leave me alone . STO
* Because I'm looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man , and I'm going to get him . STO
* If you just leave me to hell alone , Lieutenant . STO
* Killpath peered through _RARE_ _RARE_ at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and _RARE_ . STO
* Gun waited for Killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window . STO
* He sat _RARE_ in a chair that did not _RARE_ , though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly _RARE_ a _RARE_ chair . STO
* The desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room , including wooden file _RARE_ with some of their pulls yanked off and a _RARE_ stained with the roof _RARE_ of countless _RARE_ . STO
* Killpath pulled one thin leg up , _RARE_ his arms around the _RARE_ to press his knee into an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It was the _RARE_ which the men had come to recognize as that of Killpath _RARE_ his ulcer . STO
* He put his chin on his _RARE_ , stretching his neck like that of a _RARE_ on a _RARE_ block , and stared _RARE_ at his sergeant . STO
* Gun waited . STO
* The _RARE_ bell rang and he could hear the outside doors _RARE_ shut , closing in the assembled day watch . STO
* Finally , _RARE_ _RARE_ through his hawk nose , `` We can't have people running in any time they please , Sergeant '' . STO
* `` No , sir '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ in , running out . STO
* Can't have it . STO
* _RARE_ for confusion and _RARE_ '' . STO
* He rocked back in the chair , knee locked against stomach , his _RARE_ eyes fixed on Matson . STO
* He was silent again , possibly listening to the sounds in the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ was being called . STO
* Gun cleared his throat . STO
* Killpath said , `` You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago , Sergeant . STO
* That's not getting all the juice out of the orange , now is it '' ? STO
* `` No , sir '' . STO
* Then Killpath smiled . STO
* Gun knew that nothing but _RARE_ back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ commander , _RARE_ _RARE_ , was calling out the beat assignments , but Matson couldn't make the names mean anything . STO
* `` I called the station at three this morning '' , Killpath's _RARE_ voice pronounced . STO
* `` Do you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time '' ? STO
* `` Sergeant _RARE_ , sir '' . STO
* `` Now , now , you're just _RARE_ , Sergeant '' . STO
* He smiled _RARE_ , _RARE_ his joke . STO
* `` What if I said nobody was here but a couple of _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Sir , _RARE_ knows better than to leave the station without a relief . STO
* He must have '' -- `` He let a patrolman take over the duties of the station _RARE_ . STO
* Now that's not regulation , is it '' ? STO
* `` No , sir '' . STO
* `` But you didn't know a thing about it , did you '' ? STO
* Killpath leaned forward ; ; his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again , frowning now . STO
* `` That's not taking one's command with a responsible attitude , Matson '' . STO
* Gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool . STO
* But _RARE_ was no _RARE_ when it had rank . STO
* `` I was out in the district , sir '' . STO
* `` Oh , yes . STO
* So I have heard '' . STO
* He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk . STO
* `` I might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not _RARE_ limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped '' . STO
* He took up a white sheet of paper , dark with _RARE_ data . STO
* A car pulled into the driveway outside the window . STO
* Gun knew it was _RARE_ 12 , the wagon , returned from _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to the City _RARE_ . STO
* But for some fool reason he couldn't remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail . STO
* He stared at the report in Killpath's hand , sure it was written by _RARE_ -- just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his scrawled _RARE_ . STO
* He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the _RARE_ stems of his glasses around his ears and then , _RARE_ the report as it lay before him on the desk , _RARE_ , `` Acting Lieutenant _RARE_ Matson one failed to see that the station _RARE_ was properly relieved two _RARE_ himself throughout the entire watch without _RARE_ on the _RARE_ activities or the whereabouts of his section _RARE_ three permitted members of the Homicide _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Bureau to _RARE_ for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O. T. Killpath of a _RARE_ occurring in the district five _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ known as _RARE_ spots for purposes of an _RARE_ and _RARE_ social nature and six '' -- he leaned back and _RARE_ off his glasses `` -- failed to _RARE_ with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered . STO
* What have you to say to that , Sergeant '' ? STO
* Killpath _RARE_ the paper across the desk , but Matson didn't pick it up or even glance at it . STO
* `` Well '' ? STO
* `` I didn't think _RARE_ knew so many big words , Lieutenant '' . STO
* Killpath licked his lips . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ is an alert and conscientious _RARE_ officer . STO
* I don't think his _RARE_ _RARE_ your _RARE_ , Matson '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , hell '' ! STO
* Gun held his breath a moment , pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the _RARE_ in his throat . STO
* `` Sir . STO
* I would have been _RARE_ and a _RARE_ lousy cop to boot , if I'd sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district . STO
* It's too bad I didn't call you , and it's too bad I let _RARE_ use _RARE_ when he could have had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of Homicide procedure . STO
* But I'm not one damned bit sorry I went out to question the people I know in the places they hang around , and '' -- `` Let's not push our patience beyond the danger line , Sergeant '' , Killpath _RARE_ . STO
* `` I shouldn't like to have to write you up for _RARE_ as well as _RARE_ of duty '' . STO
* Gun stiffened , his hands _RARE_ into fists at his sides . STO
* He clamped his jaws to keep the fury from _RARE_ out . STO
* An argument with _RARE_ _RARE_ Killpath was as _RARE_ and as _RARE_ as a cap pistol on a firing range . STO
* Killpath leaned forward again , rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee . STO
* `` Let's just remember , Sergeant , that we must all carry our own _RARE_ . STO
* A district station can't run _RARE_ , unless '' -- He interrupted himself , looking around Gun at the doorway . STO
* `` _RARE_ , Lieutenant _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* I thought you hadn't come in yet '' . STO
* `` I've been here for some time '' . STO
* He stood up , cocked his head and eyed Gun coldly . STO
* `` The sergeant is just leaving '' . STO
* It had come as no great surprise to Matson that the hot water in the _RARE_ didn't work , that _RARE_ _RARE_ had thrown up all over the stairs , or that some _RARE_ bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes . STO
* It was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in Killpath's office . STO
* Now , as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office , he nodded and said good night to the station _RARE_ and his _RARE_ , not stopping to hear the _RARE_ _RARE_ of his chewing out . STO
* Not that he gave a damn what the _RARE_ sent out about Killpath's little speech on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He just didn't want to talk about it . STO
* If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his _RARE_ around the station all night , Killpath would just have to go out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour ; ; because he'd be damned if he was going to be a _RARE_ _RARE_ just to please his _RARE_ _RARE_ captain . STO
* At the doorway he _RARE_ up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes , remembering then that he'd left them at the _RARE_ . STO
* He could pick up another pack on his way home , if he were going home . STO
* But even before he started across the _RARE_ road to his Plymouth , parked in the lot under the _RARE_ trees across from the station , he knew that he wasn't going home . STO
* Not yet . STO
* It was nine o'clock in the morning : the hour which , like a _RARE_ turning _RARE_ of earth , exposed to the day a _RARE_ of busy creatures that had _RARE_ _RARE_ in the quiet night . STO
* Mission Street at this hour was _RARE_ by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty -- the neighborhood that had known _RARE_ _RARE_ by day . STO
* Then _RARE_ Phillips had purchased the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ seventeen years ago . STO
* It was _RARE_ worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will , and the name was written in gold in _RARE_ letters across each of the two display windows . STO
* On the right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , was _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and under that , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. Phillips took a razor to _RARE_ , _RARE_ , but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish _RARE_ would be welcome . STO
* _RARE_ was no problem anyway ; ; Mr. Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to _RARE_ aid from the _RARE_ _RARE_ children who played on the _RARE_ of Mission Street . STO
* _RARE_ from the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one _RARE_ was not the most _RARE_ , Mr. Phillips had no worries at all , and he said as much to Gun Matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ special ! STO
* `` She's honest as the day '' , Mr. Phillips said , and added , `` Mr. _RARE_ , I can say this to you : _RARE_ is a little too honest . STO
* You can't tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to _RARE_ his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down ! STO
* A time plan is a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' -- He interrupted himself , smiling . STO
* `` I put her in lamps . STO
* That way I don't lose so much '' . STO
* `` Why don't you just hire somebody else '' ? STO
* `` She says she has to finish a story '' . STO
* He shrugged . STO
* `` I asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow , but it seems the _RARE_ is working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go '' . STO
* Casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man . STO
* His name was George Needham and he , too , had come from a good family . STO
* He was perhaps _RARE_ , nicely set up , with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave . STO
* He was always well _RARE_ and well _RARE_ , and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came from two good _RARE_ schools and a proper university . STO
* An only child , he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father _RARE_ him by dying broke . STO
* Since then he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling . STO
* All this went through _RARE_ mind in the first instant , but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all . STO
* For he had understood that _RARE_ had been engaged to a boy named _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* She had grown up with young _RARE_ , and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice . STO
* He wanted to ask her about _RARE_ now , but he knew he couldn't do so in _RARE_ presence . STO
* And so , still wondering and a little _RARE_ , he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding . STO
* `` Where did you pick him up '' ? STO
* `` Oh , I've known him quite a while '' . STO
* She glanced at her companion _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ I , George '' ? STO
* `` I've been after her for years '' , Needham said , `` but I've never been able to get anywhere until the last few days '' . STO
* The girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched _RARE_ hand . STO
* `` Can I tell you a secret ? STO
* We're going to get married . STO
* Do you _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Casey kept his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about Needham , who was eight or ten years older than the girl . STO
* He wondered whether Needham was going to swear off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from _RARE_ estate to _RARE_ him . STO
* None of this showed in his face , and he tried to keep his _RARE_ in hand . STO
* He made a point of frowning , of acting out the part of the fond _RARE_ . STO
* `` I'll have to give it some thought '' , he said . STO
* `` You wouldn't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are _RARE_ , would you '' ? STO
* She made a face at him and then she laughed . STO
* `` Of course not '' . STO
* `` I'll get my references in order '' , Needham said , and though he spoke with a smile , Casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused . STO
* `` Stop by any time , Casey '' . STO
* He stood up and touched the girl's arm . STO
* `` Come on , darling . STO
* If you're really serious about working on that story , I'd better take you home '' . STO
* Casey watched them go , still frowning absently and then _RARE_ the matter as he called for his check . STO
* As he went out he told _RARE_ the dinner was perfect , and when he got his hat and coat from _RARE_ _RARE_ and put a _RARE_ piece in the slot , he told her to be sure that it went toward her _RARE_ . STO
* A taxi took him back to the bar and _RARE_ where he had left his car , and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment . STO
* Because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours , he did not think to look and see if _RARE_ _RARE_ car was still there . STO
* In fact , he did not think about _RARE_ Burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him . STO
* Only then , when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem . STO
* Even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over Burton , the pillow , the sheet of paper on top of it . STO
* Then he was _RARE_ across the room , his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note . STO
* Jack : Look in the _RARE_ . STO
* I knew the only way I could beat you was to play _RARE_ , but it was a good try , kid , and I appreciate it . STO
* The _RARE_ stood near the wall next to the divan , and the instant Casey picked it up he knew what had happened . STO
* The _RARE_ papers inside were _RARE_ , there was a _RARE_ of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct . STO
* He put the basket down _RARE_ , muttering softly and thoroughly _RARE_ with himself and his plan that had seemed so _RARE_ . STO
* For he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and then returned to the kitchen to get _RARE_ drinks for himself . STO
* For another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; ; then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious , and as the thought expanded , the implications _RARE_ him . STO
* It no longer _RARE_ that Burton had _RARE_ him . STO
* The important thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a _RARE_ with a gun in his pocket . STO
* And that gun was empty . STO
* Even before his mind had rounded out the idea , he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled out the six _RARE_ he had taken from the revolver . STO
* He considered them with brooding eyes , _RARE_ _RARE_ as his brain _RARE_ with the problem and tried to find some solution . STO
* He said : `` The crazy fool '' , half aloud . STO
* He put the shells on the table , as though he could no longer bear to hold them . STO
* He thought : Where the hell could he have gone ? STO
* How can I find him ? STO
* There was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room , his imagination out of control . STO
* He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had _RARE_ up enough to get some sense . STO
* Maybe he only intended to _RARE_ the _RARE_ , _RARE_ he was , in which case an _RARE_ gun would be good enough . STO
* He thought of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton . STO
* Then , as he turned toward the telephone , it rang _RARE_ to _RARE_ the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly . STO
* `` Yeah '' , he said . STO
* `` Casey '' ? STO
* `` Yeah '' . STO
* `` Tony Calenda '' . STO
* Casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while to make the mental _RARE_ and control the disturbance inside his head . STO
* When he heard Calenda say : `` What about that picture you took this afternoon '' ? STO
* It still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank _RARE_ . STO
* `` What picture '' ? STO
* He demanded . STO
* `` You took a picture of me at the corner of Washington and Blake about three thirty this afternoon '' . STO
* `` Who says so '' ? STO
* `` One of my boys '' . STO
* Casey believed that much . STO
* Calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his `` boys '' close at hand . STO
* `` So '' ? STO
* `` With my trial coming up in Federal Court next week I wouldn't want that picture published '' . STO
* `` Who says it's going to be published '' ? STO
* `` I wouldn't even want it to get around '' . STO
* Under normal circumstances Casey was a little _RARE_ when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken . STO
* Even so , he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who _RARE_ their objections properly . STO
* Right now , however , he was still too worried about _RARE_ Burton , and the gun that had no bullets , and the story Burton had told him , to care too much about Tony Calenda . STO
* His nerves were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice . STO
* `` Look '' , he said . STO
* `` I was hired to take a picture . STO
* I took it . STO
* That's all I know about it and that's all I care '' . STO
* `` Maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what I said '' . STO
* `` You tell him '' . STO
* `` All right '' , Calenda said , his voice still quiet . STO
* `` But I meant what I said , Casey . STO
* If that picture gets around and I find out you had anything to do with it , I'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see you '' . STO
* `` You do that '' , Casey said . STO
* `` Just be sure to send your two best boys , Tony '' . STO
* He hung up with a _RARE_ , annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create . STO
* As soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone _RARE_ and found _RARE_ _RARE_ home number . STO
* He _RARE_ it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up . STO
* He called the bar and _RARE_ where he had picked Burton up that afternoon . STO
* When he was told that no one had seen Burton since then , he thought of three other places that were possibilities . STO
* Each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up . STO
* By the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down . STO
* He had done all he could and that was that . STO
* And anyway Burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk . STO
* He , Casey , had been scared for a while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible . STO
* He should have stayed here and watched Burton . STO
* He didn't . STO
* So he made a mistake . STO
* So what ? STO
* He kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink . STO
* Only then did he decide he didn't want one . STO
* He considered opening a can of beer but _RARE_ that idea too . STO
* Finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes . STO
* He had just finished _RARE_ the right one when the telephone rang again . STO
* When he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent . STO
* `` Casey ? STO
* You don't know me but I know you . STO
* If you want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can . STO
* If you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys '' . STO
* Casey heard the _RARE_ of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision . STO
* For over the years he had received many such calls . STO
* Some of them came from people who identified themselves . STO
* Some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past . STO
* Others because they expected some sort of reward for the information . STO
* A few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break . STO
* Only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony , and , like the police , Casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time . STO
* He was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from _RARE_ Avenue . STO
* It was a district of small factories and _RARE_ buildings and occasional _RARE_ , and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the _RARE_ . STO
* He did not bother with his radio -- there would be time for that later -- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone _RARE_ and knew instantly how he had been summoned . STO
* The police car had pulled up behind a small _RARE_ , its headlights still on . STO
* Slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl , and watched Elaine rapidly spin from one station to another , tune in the null , then draw in a line on the chart . STO
* `` We're out just a little too far . STO
* Make a _RARE_ degree straight for shore '' . STO
* Poet came in , raising his eyebrows _RARE_ as he saw Elaine . STO
* `` Now '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` Pretty quick '' , she replied . STO
* `` Will you drop the anchor '' ? STO
* Poet nodded , swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward hatch where he picked up the anchor . STO
* The rock and roll music coming from the radio station suddenly faded as the boat _RARE_ into the null on the Aj . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Elaine said , then peered through the loop of the _RARE_ and waved to Poet . STO
* A second later she came behind the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean floor . STO
* She cut the _RARE_ and slowly the _RARE_ swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore . STO
* Nick watched her somewhat _RARE_ as she efficiently cut the _RARE_ , and started the _RARE_ motor . STO
* Poet came up from below , wearing new bathing _RARE_ . STO
* The price _RARE_ hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the _RARE_ and looked at it curiously . STO
* Nick wondered if Elaine had bought them , but he said nothing . STO
* Nobody , he suddenly realized , was saying anything . STO
* It seemed as if they were all under a spell . STO
* There should be an excited conversation , for somewhere , directly below them , was a _RARE_ lost for more than four hundred years . STO
* But instead of chatter there was a null , like on the radio direction _RARE_ . STO
* Once , in New York , he had gone flying with some friends in a small private _RARE_ with a single engine . STO
* They had all been laughing , _RARE_ , when suddenly the engine had failed . STO
* No one had screamed . STO
* No one had prayed . STO
* All had fallen into a complete silence , listening to the wind _RARE_ over the wings . STO
* The pilot had been good . STO
* He'd landed the plane on a small _RARE_ in Connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had _RARE_ to a stop , everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment . STO
* There had been tension in the plane during the silent _RARE_ ; ; a tension similar to the one now . STO
* But in the plane there was a concrete reason for it . STO
* Now , at this moment , there should be none unless skin _RARE_ was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe . STO
* Yet tension existed . STO
* The same _RARE_ relationship as there had been between the _RARE_ on the plane now strained at the three of them here on the boat . STO
* It hung over them like a cloud , its arrival as sudden as a cloud _RARE_ over the sun . STO
* _RARE_ , Elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit , Poet behind her , Nick _RARE_ behind him . STO
* She threw back a cushion over one of the _RARE_ , unlocked a _RARE_ on the chest beneath it , then presently straightened , holding a long knife and a wicked looking _RARE_ gun in her hand . STO
* Poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* Elaine nodded . STO
* `` They are the best '' . STO
* She kicked the locker _RARE_ shut and replaced the cushion . STO
* `` They are the most efficient '' . STO
* `` And the _RARE_ '' , Poet commented as he _RARE_ on his tank harness . STO
* `` Why do you need an _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Nick asked , _RARE_ , staring at the weapon . STO
* `` It's quite possible there's more than _RARE_ down there , man '' , Poet replied with a short , nervous laugh as he held the harness for Elaine . STO
* A moment later , moving _RARE_ because of the swimming _RARE_ , she picked up the gun , handed the knife to Poet , then rolled off the _RARE_ of the boat , back first . STO
* Poet nodded to Nick and entered the water in a similar fashion . STO
* Another moment and they were out of sight , leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their whereabouts . STO
* For a while Nick followed the twisting course of the bubbles , wondering which set came from Elaine . STO
* They remained close together , their air trail _RARE_ like _RARE_ traveling side by side . STO
* Eventually the bubbles became lost in the _RARE_ of the ocean surface , and he rolled over on his back . STO
* _RARE_ his hands behind his head , he stared at the blue sky . STO
* There was nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean . STO
* _RARE_ certainly must have enjoyed being alone . STO
* Next to the ocean , probably the _RARE_ spot was the desert . STO
* If _RARE_ uncle had stuck to this desire for _RARE_ , he probably would still be alive . STO
* Yet _RARE_ wanted money wanted money to _RARE_ through the _RARE_ . STO
* And _RARE_ wanted money probably to _RARE_ among the dice tables in _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It was an odd combination a strange pair to _RARE_ upon the wreck of the _RARE_ . STO
* But _RARE_ hadn't stumbled on it . STO
* Two to three weeks prior to the _RARE_ of the Virginia , _RARE_ had been _RARE_ around the San Luis _RARE_ Mission . STO
* The small _RARE_ with its two steel _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and Nick raised up to watch it heading south . STO
* That was a hell of a note , he thought . STO
* A couple couldn't even find a _RARE_ spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone _RARE_ down upon them . STO
* If the character flying that thing had gone over San _RARE_ Island yesterday he would have had an _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ to the west a beautiful _RARE_ slowly beat its way into the wind , headed on a _RARE_ toward San _RARE_ . STO
* Behind it a cabin _RARE_ drifted _RARE_ in the small _RARE_ , a lone _RARE_ in the chair _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ was right in the middle of the Deep . STO
* Nick recalled stories that the two best fishing spots in Southern California were over the La _RARE_ Deep and the _RARE_ Deep , two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ had warned , the land on both sides of these _RARE_ would fall into the ocean and no more La _RARE_ or _RARE_ Beach . STO
* Meanwhile , _RARE_ took advantage of them to pull up _RARE_ . STO
* Sometimes the fish _RARE_ as they _RARE_ the surface because of the difference in pressure . STO
* Why , he wondered , had Elaine wanted him along on this trip ? STO
* He couldn't _RARE_ , he couldn't run a boat , except on the open sea . STO
* He stood up , stretched , looked around for the bubbles , but could see none . STO
* _RARE_ down to the _RARE_ , he lit the _RARE_ under the coffee pot and when the _RARE_ was heated , poured himself a cup and went up to the _RARE_ . STO
* Turning on the _RARE_ , he went back to the cockpit , stretched out on the _RARE_ and listened to the music . STO
* Elaine and Poet returned together , _RARE_ up over the _RARE_ almost like _RARE_ breaking water . STO
* He sat up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern . STO
* `` Any luck '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* Poet shook his head , sliding his face mask up on his forehead . STO
* `` We're right on the edge of the Deep '' , Elaine said . STO
* _RARE_ off her face mask , she carefully placed the _RARE_ gun across the stern , then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water . STO
* `` Which is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile '' , she added as she swung her legs over the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Any news '' ? STO
* `` Not a thing '' . STO
* He tossed her a _RARE_ , then repeated the service for Poet . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Elaine shook her head as she slipped out of her harness , but Poet nodded . STO
* His feet still hung over the stern of the _RARE_ , but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in . STO
* The _RARE_ on his foot caught on the _RARE_ , throwing him off balance . STO
* His _RARE_ smashed painfully into the narrow _RARE_ and he _RARE_ as he grabbed his _RARE_ _RARE_ with his other hand and rolled into the boat . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* The word _RARE_ distinctly from Poet's lips as he struggled to his feet . STO
* Nick's body became rigid . STO
* Turning slowly he saw Poet in a brilliant glare of horror . STO
* Poet ! STO
* His face was still _RARE_ in pain as he studied the _RARE_ of his arm . STO
* Poet a murderer ? STO
* Turning quickly toward Elaine , Nick saw that she , too , stood in shocked surprise . STO
* The sudden silence was too silent . STO
* _RARE_ aware of the charged atmosphere , Poet raised his head slowly , looking first at Elaine . STO
* She had caught the implication of the _RARE_ . STO
* Her face was frozen into the mask of a _RARE_ , her body absolutely motionless . STO
* And then Nick knew that all of them knew Elaine , himself and Poet . STO
* Elaine recovered first , so quickly that Nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction . STO
* `` Do you need a _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She asked steadily . STO
* Poet rubbed his arm . STO
* `` It's like _RARE_ a _RARE_ '' , he said , his eyes _RARE_ on Nick's face , then moved back to Elaine . STO
* `` _RARE_ like hell for a second , then it _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I'll get some _RARE_ '' . STO
* Elaine turned and started toward the _RARE_ . STO
* But her walk was too steady , too slow , _RARE_ her fear . STO
* Nick sensed it . STO
* So did Poet . STO
* _RARE_ like a cat , he leaped back , _RARE_ up the spring gun and , whirling , pointed it toward the cabin . STO
* At the same instant , Nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man . STO
* The gun fired next to his ear with a vicious _RARE_ like the first stroke of an old steam engine . STO
* At the same instant , Elaine screamed wildly , the sound ending abruptly as Nick went off the boat and into the water on top of the frantic , struggling Poet . STO
* The moment the sea closed over Nick , some _RARE_ sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic . STO
* But the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage . STO
* The wide _RARE_ on Poet's feet gave his legs incredible power , driving the two of them down into the water as they rolled over and over . STO
* Poet was the captured , arms _RARE_ to his side , and he twisted _RARE_ trying to escape . STO
* Poet would escape , Nick thought grimly , because he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under water . STO
* But Nick would not let go . STO
* The rubber and glass face mask slipped from Poet's forehead , bounced _RARE_ off Nick's chin , then disappeared . STO
* Poet twisted again and Nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank , _RARE_ off the skin . STO
* For a split second , Nick relaxed his grip and Poet's _RARE_ body spun completely around before Nick could stop him , holding him now from the rear . STO
* Something _RARE_ at the side of Nick's head as they rolled around and around . STO
* Suddenly Poet stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water , not rising , not _RARE_ . STO
* A sharp pain _RARE_ across Nick's chest and a bubble of air escaped from his _RARE_ lungs , _RARE_ _RARE_ of others that _RARE_ _RARE_ toward the surface like helium _RARE_ rising into the sky . STO
* A black , _RARE_ object swayed _RARE_ in front of him , _RARE_ bubbles from its flat _RARE_ head . STO
* The air hose was free ! STO
* The discovery struck Nick like a blow . STO
* _RARE_ , Nick flashed one hand up , _RARE_ Poet's neck in the bend of his elbow . STO
* At the same instant , he grabbed the loose , _RARE_ hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece . STO
* _RARE_ he _RARE_ through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose . STO
* At once the _RARE_ pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden , wild _RARE_ . STO
* As if this was a signal , Poet abruptly began to _RARE_ the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water . STO
* _RARE_ , Nick held on , sucking on the hose , _RARE_ the air that belonged to Poet . STO
* Poet was not fighting Nick now . STO
* Harbor Point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It's a rich village but not much for action -- too many solid residents , not enough tourists or working _RARE_ . STO
* It's at the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for a hit and run _RARE_ -- about seven months ago . STO
* Chief Bob Moore looked his same _RARE_ ; ; a man mountain running to _RARE_ in his _RARE_ . STO
* Seeing me he said with real surprise , `` Well , well , ain't we _RARE_ ! STO
* _RARE_ expected the head of County Homicide up for this murder . STO
* You sure climbed fast , Jed . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ last summer and now it's Inspector Jed . STO
* _RARE_ me 19 years to become Chief of our three man police force . STO
* _RARE_ a college education _RARE_ off '' . STO
* His _RARE_ was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth . STO
* `` I guess it helps '' , I said , paying no attention to his _RARE_ . STO
* `` Never could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop , Jed . STO
* You're not only young but well , you don't even look like a police officer . STO
* A _RARE_ with narrow shoulders and that brush _RARE_ hell , you'd pass for a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ set . STO
* In my day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law , big and tough . STO
* Man , when my _RARE_ pounds and _RARE_ comes along , why it's the same as another _RARE_ . STO
* When I say move , a guy moves '' ! STO
* `` Don't worry about my being tough , Moore . STO
* Also , it's far too early in the day for _RARE_ lines like the bigger they come You've had your _RARE_ lecture , let's get to work . STO
* Who was the murdered woman Mrs. Buck '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ , nice sort of woman . STO
* _RARE_ fixed . STO
* _RARE_ a _RARE_ farm . STO
* _RARE_ to the Harbor as a bride and Don't worry Jed , this one is in the bag . STO
* I know the killer , have the only road off the _RARE_ covered '' . STO
* `` Yeah , passed your road block as I drove in '' , I said , sitting on his polished desk . STO
* Although Bob dressed like a _RARE_ , he kept a neat office . STO
* `` Okay , what happened '' ? STO
* `` About nine this morning Mrs. Buck _RARE_ me she's having trouble with one of her farm hands -- money trouble . STO
* _RARE_ fellow named Tim Williams -- only hand she has working for her now . STO
* Tim come with the _RARE_ workers that follow the _RARE_ up from the South last year , but Tim and his wife settled here . STO
* Never had no trouble with him before , thought he was a hard worker , _RARE_ around to get a full _RARE_ work . STO
* Anyway , Julia asks me to . STO
* '' `` Julia '' ? STO
* `` Come on , Inspector , look alive . STO
* Julia Buck , the deceased '' , Moore said , _RARE_ me his _RARE_ , _RARE_ again . STO
* `` Julia asks me to come out at once . STO
* But she didn't sound real alarmed you know , like there was any immediate danger . STO
* I got there at _RARE_ A.M. , found her _RARE_ . STO
* I would have come sooner if I'd known . STO
* No doubt about Tim being the killer -- I have a witness . STO
* Don't know why the County had to send anybody up here . STO
* _RARE_ them I can handle this '' . STO
* `` Yeah , seems you have a nice package , with all the _RARE_ tied . STO
* Who's '' ? STO
* `` I'll collar Tim before night '' . STO
* `` Who's your witness '' ? STO
* `` Julia had -- has -- an old Indian woman cooking for her -- Nellie Harris . STO
* Probably the last of the original Island Indians . STO
* Nellie was in the kitchen , had just come to work , when she heard Tim arguing with Julia in the living room . STO
* _RARE_ she recognized his voice , that Tim yelled , ' It's my money and I want it ' ! STO
* And then rushed out of the house . STO
* Then she heard Julia phone me . STO
* Nellie went on with her house work -- until I found Julia dead . STO
* And before you say it , Nellie ain't near strong enough to have _RARE_ Julia . STO
* There's no doubt this Tim sneaked back and killed Mrs. Buck . STO
* Another fact : _RARE_ disappeared -- on the run . STO
* But there's no way off the Point except through my road block . STO
* _RARE_ you want to see the body -- have her up the street in Doc _RARE_ office '' . STO
* `` Let's see it '' . STO
* We walked up Main Street to this big white house , then around to the back . STO
* Being the _RARE_ sole doctor , Abel was also its Medical _RARE_ . STO
* The corpse was on a table , covered by a sheet . STO
* Doc Abel was busy up front with some of his live patients . STO
* _RARE_ back the sheet , I examined the _RARE_ around Julia _RARE_ once slender throat . STO
* _RARE_ hands had killed her . STO
* `` _RARE_ any _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Chief Moore shook his big head , seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body . STO
* Then he said , `` Never noticed it before I mean , when she was dressed but for a woman her age , Julia had a real fine figure '' . STO
* I dropped the sheet , glanced at my watch . STO
* It was almost one and I hadn't had lunch . STO
* Still , I wanted to get this over with , had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office . STO
* I told him , `` I want to go see the Buck house '' . STO
* `` Sure '' . STO
* _RARE_ back down Main Street , I said , `` I saw the _RARE_ one squad car at the road block , we'll ride out in my car '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , we'll use mine '' , Moore said , opening the door of a _RARE_ white Jaguar _RARE_ . STO
* As I slid in beside him he said , `` Some heap , _RARE_ ? STO
* Got a _RARE_ of a buy on this , dirt cheap '' . STO
* `` Yeah , it's a real load '' , I told him , looking up the street at my battered Ford . STO
* Five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house , and when the Jaguar stopped I managed to swallow . STO
* There was a garage and a modern barn in the rear , all of it standing between two large flat fields _RARE_ in early potatoes . STO
* Everything shouted gentleman _RARE_ , the kind of _RARE_ _RARE_ money the Point is known for . STO
* The _RARE_ of a _RARE_ were sticking out of the garage , while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture . STO
* Nellie Harris wasn't old , she was ancient -- a tiny _RARE_ woman with a face like a tan _RARE_ . STO
* She was also stone _RARE_ in her right ear . STO
* She calmly repeated what Moore had told me . STO
* When I asked , `` Why didn't you go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was '' ? STO
* The old _RARE_ stared at me with her hard eyes , said , `` She didn't call . STO
* I do the living room last . STO
* I went up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom -- way I always do in the morning '' . STO
* `` Have you any idea what this Tim and Mrs. Buck were arguing about '' ? STO
* `` Probably wages . STO
* Miss Julia was a hard woman with a dollar . STO
* _RARE_ ago when I asked her to put me in Social Security , _RARE_ I wouldn't have to be working now , Miss Julia threatened to fire me -- all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her '' . STO
* `` Did you hear Tim return '' ? STO
* `` No sir . STO
* Nobody came until Chief Moore '' . STO
* I _RARE_ on the kitchen table with my pencil . STO
* `` Mrs. Buck have any men friends '' ? STO
* `` Her '' ? STO
* The wrinkled mouth laughed , revealing _RARE_ strong , white , teeth . STO
* `` I never see none . STO
* But then I wasn't her social secretary '' . STO
* `` Was she on friendly terms with other members of her family '' ? STO
* `` Didn't have no family -- around here . STO
* They had a son -- killed in the war '' . STO
* I walked into the living room . STO
* There didn't seem to be any signs of a struggle . STO
* I told Moore , `` Where does _RARE_ wife live '' ? STO
* `` I'll take you there . STO
* Look Jed , this is an open and shut case and I have to _RARE_ my men at the road block soon . STO
* Okay , come on '' . STO
* We did 80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of _RARE_ . STO
* In late summer _RARE_ workers lived five and six to a room in these . STO
* Now they were empty , except for a cottage across the road . STO
* Mrs. Tim Williams was about 21 , with skin the color of bitter _RARE_ , and if you _RARE_ the plain dress and worn slippers , she was _RARE_ pretty . STO
* The inside of their place was full of new furniture , five _RARE_ down and a _RARE_ a week stuff , but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home . STO
* Mrs. Williams was both sullen and frightened . STO
* She said she didn't know a thing -- Tim had left the house at six in the morning , as usual . STO
* She hadn't seen him since . STO
* `` Did Mrs. Buck owe him any wages '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` Well , for this week , but they wasn't due _RARE_ Saturday . STO
* Listen , Mr. Inspector , no matter what anybody say , my Tim didn't kill that woman ! STO
* Tim is a good man , hard working . STO
* He strong as a bull but gentle as a baby . STO
* Even if he angry , Tim wouldn't hurt a woman . STO
* He never in his life took a hand to a woman or '' `` We'll get him soon , see what he says '' , Chief Moore cut in . STO
* `` Does your husband have a car '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` Got us an old station wagon . STO
* _RARE_ it for the job '' . STO
* I asked a silly question : `` You've no idea where your husband could be , now '' ? STO
* She shook her head . STO
* I knew she was lying . STO
* I stood there , staring at her for a moment -- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty . STO
* Moore said , `` Come on , Jed , I have to get to my men '' . STO
* On my way out I told her , `` If you should _RARE_ just happen to see your husband , get him to give himself up . STO
* He'll get a fair trial . STO
* _RARE_ out like this won't get him anything , except more trouble , or a bullet '' . STO
* `` Yes . STO
* I'll tell him -- if I see him '' . STO
* We made it back to the Harbor in less than four minutes . STO
* I tried not to act scared . STO
* That Jaguar could really barrel along . STO
* I told Moore I was going to eat , get some forms filled out by Doc Abel . STO
* Chief Moore said , `` If I don't see you when I return , see you for certain at my road block , Inspector '' . STO
* I had a bowl of decent _RARE_ , phoned the Doc and he said he'd leave the death statements with his girl -- in a half hour . STO
* _RARE_ my pipe , I took a walk . STO
* The Harbor is a big _RARE_ _RARE_ in the summer . STO
* Even now , there were several slick _RARE_ tied to the _RARE_ , an _RARE_ _RARE_ anchored inside the _RARE_ . STO
* There was a 34 foot _RARE_ with Chief _RARE_ in big gold letters on its stern also tied up at the _RARE_ . STO
* It wasn't a new boat , about five years old , but fitted with fishing _RARE_ and chairs . STO
* I asked an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was _RARE_ . STO
* He said , `` You bet . STO
* Bob Moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing '' . STO
* I dropped into the doctor's office , picked up my forms . STO
* As I was walking back to the Police _RARE_ , which was in the same building with the City Hall and Post Office , I saw Mrs. Tim Williams _RARE_ into the back of my car . STO
* If she moved gracefully , she was _RARE_ at it . STO
* I got into the front seat . STO
* She was ' hiding ' on the floor of the back seat , the soft curves of her back and hips -- _RARE_ lines . STO
* I drove out of the Harbor , turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped . STO
* I waited a few minutes and she sat up . STO
* For another moment we didn't talk , then she began to weep . STO
* She mumbled , `` I just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim '' ! STO
* `` Maybe . STO
* I never saw him so anxious before '' , I said , lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette . STO
* `` Of course , it could be because this is his first murder case . STO
* You know where Tim is , don't you , Mrs. Williams '' ? STO
* She _RARE_ on the cigarette slowly , sitting slumped against the back seat ; ; didn't answer . STO
* But the police have dropped the case . STO
* I want you to go to Pearson City and find out why -- _RARE_ stuff for your modern crime series . STO
* Take the same train Diana Beauclerk took and get there at the same time . STO
* Go to the same hotel and occupy the same suite -- 1105 '' . STO
* `` Will the hotel rent it so soon after the crime '' ? STO
* `` Why not ? STO
* The police have finished with it . STO
* Besides , the number of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper . STO
* To the hotel people , you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite '' . STO
* `` Still , they may not want to rent it '' . STO
* `` That's your _RARE_ . STO
* Once inside , keep your eyes open '' ! STO
* `` For what '' ! STO
* Alec was growing more and more _RARE_ . STO
* `` The police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a _RARE_ comb . STO
* The hotel people will have _RARE_ and _RARE_ it . STO
* Ten to one , it's even been _RARE_ '' ! STO
* `` There's always a chance they may have _RARE_ something '' , returned the chief . STO
* `` I'm _RARE_ on that chance . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ and _RARE_ who waited on Beauclerk . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the suite . STO
* _RARE_ up local color . STO
* _RARE_ everything Beauclerk did . STO
* Try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself -- between eleven p.m. and one _RARE_ the night you arrive '' . STO
* Alec _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ way to spend an evening '' ! STO
* A sudden thought wiped the _RARE_ from his face . STO
* `` Suppose the murderer should return to the scene of the crime '' ! STO
* The _RARE_ eyes _RARE_ . STO
* He spoke softly . STO
* `` That is exactly what I'm hoping for . STO
* After all , the murderer is still at large . STO
* And the key to the suite is still missing '' . STO
* On the train Alec _RARE_ his memory of the Beauclerk case by reading _RARE_ _RARE_ -- _RARE_ stories about the crime sent out by the Pearson City _RARE_ , a member of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Diana Beauclerk was a _RARE_ _RARE_ living in New York . STO
* Two weeks ago she had gone west to Pearson City . STO
* _RARE_ Forbes , her _RARE_ husband , lived there . STO
* So did the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce , _RARE_ and Stacy . STO
* She reached Pearson City at nine p.m. and went straight to the Hotel _RARE_ . STO
* She telephoned the junior partner of her law firm , Martin Stacy , and asked him to call at her hotel that evening . STO
* At the time of her divorce Forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in _RARE_ of further _RARE_ if she _RARE_ . STO
* According to Stacy , she told him she was planning to _RARE_ and she wanted him to ask Forbes for the lump sum . STO
* Stacy replied that it would _RARE_ Forbes , who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture . STO
* Stacy said he left her suite at nine _RARE_ p.m. . STO
* She was in good health and spirits , but still determined to get the money from Forbes . STO
* No one saw Stacy leave . STO
* No other _RARE_ inquired for her that evening . STO
* Next morning she was found dead in her suite with a bullet from a _RARE_ revolver in her brain . STO
* According to the medical _RARE_ , she was shot between eleven p.m. and one _RARE_ . STO
* Her door was locked and the key was missing . STO
* So was the gun . STO
* When Alec finished reading he was sure that either Forbes or Stacy had killed Diana Beauclerk . STO
* Forbes had motive and Stacy had opportunity . STO
* _RARE_ a motive for Stacy or an opportunity for Forbes and the case would be solved . STO
* The Hotel _RARE_ proved to be one of the older hotels in Pearson City , and definitely _RARE_ . STO
* Alec's first impression of the lobby was _RARE_ , _RARE_ dignity -- black _RARE_ and red _RARE_ , a black and white _RARE_ floor , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He studied the night clerk as a man measures an _RARE_ . STO
* `` I'd like the room I had the last time '' . STO
* `` Certainly , sir '' . STO
* The clerk was young and limp , with a tired smile . STO
* `` Do you recall the number '' ? STO
* `` It was 1105 '' . STO
* The clerk's smile _RARE_ . STO
* `` That suite is taken '' . STO
* Alec's glance went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk . STO
* _RARE_ the number 1105 stood one word : _RARE_ . STO
* The clerk's glance followed Alec's . STO
* `` We have better rooms vacant now '' , he _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ and more comfortable . STO
* At the same rate '' . STO
* Alec's face was dark , blunt , and _RARE_ . STO
* He always looked _RARE_ and he could look dangerous . STO
* He was looking dangerous now . STO
* He raised his voice . STO
* `` Anything wrong with the _RARE_ in 1105 '' ? STO
* There was a sudden stillness in the lobby . STO
* Two women , who had been chattering like _RARE_ , were struck dumb . STO
* A man , lighting a match for his cigar , paused until the flame burned his fingers . STO
* Even the _RARE_ on their bench were listening . STO
* The clerk's eyes _RARE_ . STO
* `` Of course not '' ! STO
* `` _RARE_ with a _RARE_ disease been in there '' ? STO
* `` No '' ! STO
* The clerk was almost hysterical . STO
* `` It's just that -- well , 1105 is being _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I don't believe it '' . STO
* Alec leaned on the desk , holding the clerk's eyes with his . STO
* `` Suppose you tell me the real reason '' , he _RARE_ . STO
* `` There might be a story in it '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` I'm with the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ Service . STO
* _RARE_ I get the story -- or I get the suite '' . STO
* It was _RARE_ and the clerk knew it . STO
* `` There is no story '' , he _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ ! STO
* _RARE_ this gentleman to 1105 '' ! STO
* The stillness persisted as Alec followed a _RARE_ across the lobby to the elevator . STO
* He could feel eyes on his back . STO
* He wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly . STO
* The corridor on the _RARE_ floor was dimly lighted by electric _RARE_ at intervals of thirty feet . STO
* A thick , _RARE_ carpet muffled every _RARE_ . STO
* At the end of the corridor Alec noticed a door marked : Fire _RARE_ . STO
* It was a neat setup for murder . STO
* The _RARE_ unlocked a white door _RARE_ 1105 . STO
* The room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window . STO
* A few _RARE_ _RARE_ down through that _RARE_ red glow , _RARE_ as falling feathers . STO
* _RARE_ the boy switched on a ceiling light . STO
* The room looked normal and even commonplace . STO
* There was no hint of a violent struggle now . STO
* _RARE_ furniture with a _RARE_ finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store . STO
* The blue rug was _RARE_ bright and new . STO
* It had never been stained with blood . STO
* Table covers and towels were clean , _RARE_ empty and supplied with fresh matches . STO
* The mirror over the bureau was a blank eye , round and innocent . STO
* Alec played the part of an innocent tourist . STO
* `` Is there anything wrong with this room '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* The boy dropped his eyes . STO
* `` _RARE_ you'll lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut '' ? STO
* The boy raised his eyes . STO
* `` Listen , _RARE_ . STO
* If you want my advice , pack up and take the next train back to New York '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ you on duty here two weeks ago '' ? STO
* The boy hesitated . STO
* Then , `` I'm not talking . STO
* But I wouldn't spend a night in here for a million _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He was in a hurry to get out of the room . STO
* Alec gave him a tip and let him go . STO
* _RARE_ , Alec examined the doors . STO
* There were three -- one leading to a bathroom , one to the hall , and one to the room next door which was _RARE_ -- locked or _RARE_ on the other side . STO
* Alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the _RARE_ table . STO
* It was just quarter of nine . STO
* As he ranged his _RARE_ on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the _RARE_ cover . STO
* Not gray like the dust that _RARE_ in an _RARE_ room , but white . STO
* _RARE_ didn't use white face powder nowadays , he recalled . STO
* They used pink , tan , or cream powder . STO
* Alec glanced into the bathroom . STO
* Blood in the _RARE_ where the murderer appears to have washed his hands . STO
* It seemed clean now , but Alec decided against a bath . STO
* He crawled into bed and switched off the light . STO
* In the darkness he could see the _RARE_ reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window . STO
* It winked as steadily as a _RARE_ -- on , off -- on , off . STO
* In less than five minutes Alec was asleep . STO
* He never knew just what woke him . STO
* Yet suddenly he was _RARE_ . STO
* There was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the red light on the wall . STO
* He lay still , listening to the silence , watching the light . STO
* Somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes -- midnight . STO
* According to the medical _RARE_ she was shot between eleven p.m. and one _RARE_ . STO
* Alec heard a faint sound . STO
* His heart seemed to _RARE_ and knock against the wall of his chest . STO
* For the sound was inside the room . STO
* He let his eyelids _RARE_ and breathed heavily , _RARE_ sleep . STO
* The sound was coming nearer . STO
* A monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall , distorted and _RARE_ . STO
* When the neon sign faded out , the shadow disappeared . STO
* When the neon sign flashed on , the shadow was still there . STO
* It stretched to an impossible height , climbing the wall to the ceiling . STO
* That meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light -- in this case , the window . STO
* _RARE_ Alec _RARE_ his muscles , ready to jump . STO
* The _RARE_ betrayed him with a _RARE_ . STO
* The shadow vanished . STO
* Someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window . STO
* _RARE_ caution , Alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch . STO
* Before he could snap it on , a _RARE_ blow caught him in the ribs . STO
* He _RARE_ out _RARE_ with his right . STO
* There was a thick , _RARE_ crack of fist on flesh . STO
* Something hard _RARE_ his knuckles . STO
* He put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be . STO
* _RARE_ cloth _RARE_ his fist . STO
* There was a _RARE_ , curiously _RARE_ , like that of an animal in pain . STO
* Something heavy shook the floor as it dropped . STO
* Alec waited a moment , on guard . STO
* Nothing happened . STO
* Again he groped for the light switch . STO
* The blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room . STO
* On the bare _RARE_ a man lay face down . STO
* He had a short , heavy , powerful body . STO
* Alec turned him over and discovered a round , _RARE_ face with narrow , _RARE_ eyes -- a primitive _RARE_ face from Russia or the _RARE_ . STO
* The man's shoes were too pointed , his overcoat too broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist . STO
* There was a slight _RARE_ under the left _RARE_ -- a shoulder holster . STO
* Alec promptly removed the gun . STO
* He was familiar with this type . STO
* He had seen it in the _RARE_ at Police _RARE_ in New York , in Broadway night _RARE_ and _RARE_ Avenue pool rooms , in the criminal courts . STO
* But he was surprised to meet it here . STO
* Diana Beauclerk had no connection with the _RARE_ . STO
* A professional _RARE_ would not have killed her with a weapon of such small _RARE_ as a . STO
* Nor would he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be so much _RARE_ to take his victim for a _RARE_ ride on a lonely country road . STO
* The man's eyelids _RARE_ . STO
* He opened his eyes . STO
* `` What are you doing here '' ? STO
* _RARE_ Alec . STO
* The man made no reply . STO
* His eyes were _RARE_ . STO
* His lips were _RARE_ and swollen where Alec had hit him . STO
* `` Did you kill Diana Beauclerk '' ? STO
* Alec expected an _RARE_ denial , but there was no response at all . STO
* `` Oh , come on , snap out of it ! STO
* Or I'll turn you over to the police '' ! STO
* The silence was getting on Alec's nerves . STO
* The man opened his mouth , but no words came . STO
* Only that curious , animal _RARE_ Alec had heard during their fight . STO
* `` Don't you speak English '' ? STO
* The man opened his mouth wider . STO
* A forefinger pointed toward his _RARE_ . STO
* Alec leaned forward to look . STO
* There were hideous scars inside the throat and the _RARE_ was _RARE_ . STO
* In good time I shall get to the _RARE_ _RARE_ , to Red _RARE_ and Handley Walker , to murder and sudden death . STO
* But you realize , I am sure , how much old _RARE_ _RARE_ to new ones , and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones . STO
* It was in _RARE_ that _RARE_ _RARE_ and his sister sat by a _RARE_ fire in their house on Dogtown Common , a _RARE_ place even then . STO
* He was _RARE_ his razor . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , said he `` do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven '' ? STO
* And she answered , `` I don't know , but I hope you'll never do such a thing '' . STO
* Without a _RARE_ , `` God _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He said , and went out and cut his throat in the cave near Granny _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* What has this to do with the present ? STO
* Much , I assure you . STO
* You must know what gets into people , even such as Red and Handley , before you can tell what comes out of them . STO
* They had learned , both of them , about _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* That's why I beg you not to forget him . STO
* His ghost is not laid . STO
* Red and Handley , God help them , knew the old Dogtown lore ; ; and I knew they knew it , for I'd told them a lot of it . STO
* And isn't it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows ? STO
* Yes , gentlemen , I am getting to the point , to my point . STO
* You know the facts ; ; they are set forth in your own newspapers . STO
* You want from me the story , but a story is about ' why ' and then , perhaps , about how . STO
* The ' when ' you know ; ; yesterday morning . STO
* So what I am trying to tell you is the ' why ' -- that is my point -- and that concerns the spirit of the matter . STO
* There is an _RARE_ and a _RARE_ to old furniture ( look at that _RARE_ _RARE_ behind you ) which has a _RARE_ _RARE_ , if I may say so . STO
* _RARE_ , too , have their haunting qualities . STO
* Even people . STO
* And my point in this sad story is the spirit of the matter . STO
* When you hold the spirit of a thing , then somehow you know the truth -- you know a _RARE_ antique from the real thing . STO
* And the truth is what you've come for , is it not ? STO
* Now , Dogtown is one of those places that _RARE_ into the marrow as _RARE_ get into old wood , under the _RARE_ . STO
* In fact , all the folk who lived on the back of _RARE_ Ann , they are not just like others . STO
* There's a different _RARE_ on them . STO
* There were no _RARE_ _RARE_ here because everyone had a _RARE_ in the family . STO
* Just think of old _RARE_ _RARE_ who pulled the teeth of Dark _RARE_ ( her real name was _RARE_ ) , and because he _RARE_ the job and left two _RARE_ _RARE_ she put such a _RARE_ on him that he thought his legs were made of glass . STO
* After that he was never known to run or even walk fast . STO
* Today Dogtown is the only deserted village in all New England that I know of . STO
* There it _RARE_ , a small _RARE_ , with towns like Gloucester near by ; ; but now it's the most lost and _RARE_ place in the world . STO
* Those who lived in that _RARE_ of rocky _RARE_ took on some of the _RARE_ _RARE_ character . STO
* _RARE_ say it is the last _RARE_ of a great _RARE_ , but one rather feels that only a _RARE_ giant could have piled up those _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended , ominous life in them . STO
* We'll walk up there later . STO
* It's perhaps a mile from here where we sit . STO
* And not one single dwelling left there , though once , in the early _RARE_ century , there were close to a hundred houses . STO
* ( I myself have identified about sixty _RARE_ , from the old _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* A fascinating pursuit , I assure you . STO
* ) Even I can remember nothing but ruined _RARE_ and tumbled _RARE_ , and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man . STO
* It is now a sweep of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , with oak , _RARE_ and _RARE_ creeping across the common , and everywhere the _RARE_ and the long , long shadows . STO
* That's your setting , and a sinister one . STO
* Please get that in your reports . STO
* It accounts for so many things . STO
* Both Red _RARE_ and Handley Walker lived nearby , almost as near as I do . STO
* Red lived at _RARE_ , and from his house he could be up on the Common in a half _RARE_ _RARE_ walk ; ; Handley lived further on , at _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I'd often find one or other of them up around Dogtown _RARE_ . STO
* They were both painters , ( They were ? STO
* They are ? STO
* What should one say ? STO
* ) Well , anyhow , Dogtown Common is so much off the beaten track nowadays that only Sunday _RARE_ still stray up there , from time to time . STO
* _RARE_ , railroad , lack of water , killed Dogtown . STO
* Dead , dead as a brass door nail , and I sometimes feel like the _RARE_ , for I'm about the last to be even interested . STO
* I knew Red and Handley well . STO
* As I said , they were both painters . STO
* They'd come , separately , to Gloucester some twenty years ago -- there's always been an _RARE_ colony somewhere on _RARE_ Ann -- and each married here . STO
* They married cousins , Anta and _RARE_ Norberg . STO
* There are a lot of _RARE_ in this neck of the woods , and many still make painted furniture and take _RARE_ . STO
* Pretty girls among them , with blonde hair and _RARE_ faces . STO
* Handley married _RARE_ and Red , of the red beard , married Anta . STO
* And it was because of an old Norberg _RARE_ that I got to understand them all so well . STO
* The quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw , but I must tell you about it . STO
* Oh , yes , I'm quite sure it's important , because of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* What's that ? STO
* Why , that's what gave me the feeling , gave me _RARE_ the spirit , the _RARE_ , evil spirit of this whole affair . STO
* You see , besides being _RARE_ of _RARE_ , I am also _RARE_ . STO
* No , I don't hold with those who live entirely among dead things . STO
* I know as well as the next man that a ship is called from the _RARE_ she carries , where the live wind _RARE_ , and not from the _RARE_ . STO
* But you've got to know both . STO
* What's below the _RARE_ interests me also . STO
* As I was saying , I've known all about the old records , including the old Norberg _RARE_ . STO
* Some ten years ago that page was torn out , I don't know by whom . STO
* About five years ago , Handley came to ask me if he could see the _RARE_ register . STO
* He was _RARE_ and casual about it , as though it were of no consequence . STO
* He's always like that , in spite of being a big man . STO
* ( When you see him , you'll notice his habit of _RARE_ , I might almost say , _RARE_ a large _RARE_ with black hairs on it , by his right temple . STO
* ) A _RARE_ man , but very _RARE_ , some would say slick . STO
* Like his _RARE_ black hair . STO
* Too many outside manners , to my taste . STO
* He is the sort who , with an _RARE_ eye , would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then _RARE_ her . STO
* A real gentleman , I feel , would do neither . STO
* He's always worn a _RARE_ hat , and I've noticed , in my small study at the Society , that he rather _RARE_ of cosmetics . STO
* The next week , cousin Red wandered in as casually , but _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Red was small and _RARE_ , like _RARE_ . STO
* He too asked to see the same page . STO
* When I told him someone had torn it out , he shouted . STO
* `` By God , it's that damn Handley , the _RARE_ '' ! STO
* And later in the same week they both came together to examine the register . STO
* Fortunately we were alone in the building -- so few people nowadays are interested even in their own past or in the lovely craft of other days -- for they began to _RARE_ each other in the _RARE_ language . STO
* Red thrusting out his _RARE_ beard , Handley _RARE_ under his suddenly _RARE_ black hair . STO
* They actually _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ et _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ men both . STO
* Red always was _RARE_ , yet that day the _RARE_ Handley was the louder of the two . STO
* But for my presence , they would have been at each _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* During the quarrel I learned what the trouble was , from the _RARE_ each _RARE_ at the other . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ had suddenly become valuable . STO
* There's a fine _RARE_ quarry there , and _RARE_ coming back for public buildings . STO
* Both men knew it was in the Norberg family _RARE_ , but to which of the cousins did it belong , Anta or _RARE_ ? STO
* Fortunately , I knew almost exactly what the will had said . STO
* It began with a _RARE_ , of course . STO
* This explained that the judge of _RARE_ of _RARE_ County , _RARE_ or _RARE_ , appointed three _RARE_ of Gloucester to divide and establish the Norberg estate . STO
* After the usual _RARE_ _RARE_ , it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased _RARE_ Norberg , one lower room , on the Western side , _RARE_ to the well and _RARE_ and to one third of the cellar ( I can show you the cellar when we go up ) , also one _RARE_ Right , and _RARE_ they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as _RARE_ , namely the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* And I remember that the whole of the _RARE_ , not counting the _RARE_ _RARE_ , was _RARE_ at twenty pounds . STO
* I wish you could have seen the _RARE_ fall on these two _RARE_ _RARE_ when I told them that obviously the _RARE_ belonged to their _RARE_ jointly . STO
* That battle scene , ridiculous as it was , remained in my mind . STO
* A disturbing picture of bad blood , to be further _RARE_ with _RARE_ if _RARE_ colors , for on a subsequent day I saw Handley _RARE_ Anta , _RARE_ wife , up on Dogtown Common . STO
* I felt it would be _RARE_ to disclose my presence . STO
* Not that I _RARE_ go _RARE_ , but the _RARE_ up there are very high and I am a small woman . STO
* One other cause of _RARE_ between them I must tell you . STO
* _RARE_ ! STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ as Red _RARE_ was , he was much the better painter . STO
* I suppose Handley knew it . STO
* If Red had a show at Gloucester , Handley would hurry to hang his pictures in _RARE_ . STO
* You may say this has little _RARE_ , but , gentlemen , remember that all this prepared my mind , _RARE_ my intelligence . STO
* By such _RARE_ the pattern takes shape . STO
* You would call these the motives of crime . STO
* I would call them the patterns of life , perhaps even the _RARE_ of destiny . STO
* Yet with all this knowledge I had nothing of substance to _RARE_ our case , as you would call it , till yesterday . STO
* One month ago , on the _RARE_ of October , was the opening of the _RARE_ season in _RARE_ . STO
* Not much to shoot , but there are a few _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , too , if you care for them , which most of the folk around here haven't the sense to appreciate . STO
* Any more than they have the sense to eat _RARE_ . STO
* That was the day Red was said to have gone away . STO
* Oh yes , he'd talked about doing so . STO
* In fact , he often disappeared , from time to time , -- off to paint the sea , aboard a _RARE_ out from Gloucester . STO
* Anta , his wife , never seemed to mind . STO
* I suppose these _RARE_ gave her more _RARE_ for her _RARE_ with Cousin Handley . STO
* _RARE_ , I wasn't surprised , early that morning , to see Handley himself crossing from Dogtown Common Road to the Back Road . STO
* No , he didn't have his gun , which he should have . STO
* It would have been a good excuse for his being there at all . STO
* I myself had been up there by seven o'clock , after _RARE_ , since _RARE_ been a week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear as _RARE_ glass . STO
* That's what the man had said . STO
* Haney peered _RARE_ at his drinking companion through _RARE_ , _RARE_ eyes . STO
* He had no ready answer , as much from surprise as from the fit of _RARE_ . STO
* Was the man drunk or crazy or both ? STO
* But his _RARE_ buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count , and the man's eyes were still clear . STO
* The guy is off his _RARE_ , Haney thought to himself , and looked away from those eyes . STO
* Eyes that were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them . STO
* Why hadn't he noticed it before ? STO
* No , the man was not drunk He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger . STO
* But , of course , he remembered now . STO
* It was _RARE_ , after two hours of steady drinking , but the occasion of it came back to him . STO
* The stranger , his head seemingly sunk in thought , started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving _RARE_ roared through the intersection . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ and a horn _RARE_ furiously , but the man would have been hit if Phil hadn't called out to him a second before . STO
* His shout had been _RARE_ , something anybody might have done without thinking , on the spur of the moment . STO
* As a matter of fact , he wouldn't have cared at all if the guy had been hit . STO
* Actually , he _RARE_ having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them . STO
* By then , the stranger was _RARE_ Haney _RARE_ and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend . STO
* So the driver started to _RARE_ at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his _RARE_ record . STO
* Then the man he saved turned and looked _RARE_ into the truck driver's face , without saying a word . STO
* Very suddenly , the driver stopped _RARE_ at them , turned on his _RARE_ and went back to his truck . STO
* Haney hadn't given it much thought at the time . STO
* Now he recalled it very clearly , and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off . STO
* It must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word . STO
* When the light went their way , they went on across the street . STO
* And when the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars , he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them . STO
* Phil usually went alone and kept to himself , sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite _RARE_ . STO
* But he decided he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks , even though he made good money at his job . STO
* Phil was like that . STO
* Now he wondered if it was worth it , having a _RARE_ for company . STO
* He really didn't take the offer seriously , but he began to feel uneasy . STO
* When he finally got the _RARE_ under control , he realized that Pete ( all he gave was his first name ) was still waiting for an answer -- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued to stare . STO
* Haney managed a weak laugh . STO
* `` _RARE_ I can't think of anyone , Pete . STO
* Thanks anyhow '' . STO
* A faint _RARE_ appeared between the man's eyebrows . STO
* `` I think you aren't taking me seriously , Phil . STO
* I meant it . STO
* And everybody has some kind of _RARE_ . STO
* I might have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you . STO
* I believe in returning favors . STO
* I'll do anything for somebody I like . STO
* It won't cost you a cent , Phil . STO
* Go ahead and try me '' ! STO
* Phil rubbed his forehead wearily . STO
* He was beginning to feel _RARE_ . STO
* Maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit . STO
* He really didn't expect anything to come of it , and there were a few people `` All right '' , he _RARE_ finally , `` if you must know , I don't get along with the landlord . STO
* He keeps riding me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while I'm taking a bath . STO
* He says the neighbors complain , but I don't believe it . STO
* Why don't they tell me themselves if it _RARE_ them '' ? STO
* The man closed his eyes and nodded . STO
* When he looked up again , he seemed almost _RARE_ . STO
* `` Fine . STO
* Give me your address . STO
* It will take a little time . STO
* I want to study your _RARE_ habits and movements first . STO
* You see , I always make it look like an accident . STO
* Maybe suicide , if it looks reasonable . STO
* In that way there's no trouble for the customer '' . STO
* _RARE_ eyebrows flew up . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Pete smiled _RARE_ . STO
* `` It's my line of work '' , he said Five minutes later , before Haney could make his break , the stranger stood up and nodded farewell . STO
* Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently , and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure . STO
* Phil decided to stay a little longer , and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there , but for the other glass on the table . STO
* Some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the _RARE_ , putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep . STO
* The next day , Sunday , the _RARE_ reminded Haney where he had been the night before . STO
* The _RARE_ in turn reminded him of his conversation with the _RARE_ , and he _RARE_ . STO
* He went for more _RARE_ later in the day , and passed the _RARE_ landlord on the way -- he was still alive and _RARE_ as usual , as if tenants were a burden in his life . STO
* Phil shrugged and ignored him . STO
* He went back to work Monday . STO
* By Wednesday the landlord was still alive . STO
* Of course On Thursday , Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife _RARE_ , and wished the stranger could do something about her _RARE_ home from work , he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building . STO
* Inside the lobby , people were standing around , talking excitedly . STO
* His _RARE_ crawled with a _RARE_ _RARE_ as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened . STO
* The landlord had died . STO
* _RARE_ that afternoon , it seemed , he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection . STO
* He had apparently been alone . STO
* Nobody witnessed the fall -- just the _RARE_ impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance . STO
* Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden _RARE_ , as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks . STO
* He muttered something about how terrible it was , and walked with deliberate _RARE_ to the elevator . STO
* Once inside his apartment , he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped _RARE_ in a chair . STO
* After a while he began to feel better about it , especially when no one bothered to ask any questions . STO
* But after all , why should they ? STO
* Still later , he finally convinced himself that it was an accident -- just a coincidence . STO
* The stranger really had nothing to do with it , of course Haney went to bed , happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord . STO
* After all , the man had no family , so no one suffered , and everybody was better off for it . STO
* Really , he said to himself , nobody _RARE_ a man just as a favor ! STO
* So you thought I didn't mean what I said . STO
* The _RARE_ eyes were large and sad , as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings . STO
* It was like a _RARE_ , _RARE_ dream , but now the dream was beginning to take on _RARE_ of a nightmare . STO
* However , Haney knew it was not a dream . STO
* He might be very tight , but he knew where he was . STO
* It was the same bar , and it was two weeks later -- Saturday night , when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual . STO
* He had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table , as far as possible from any _RARE_ , friendly _RARE_ . STO
* He was enjoying the weekly _RARE_ of washing down his _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ slightly _RARE_ with water . STO
* This favorite _RARE_ was not the landlord . STO
* He had already quite forgotten about him . STO
* In fact , he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment . STO
* His real _RARE_ was _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the end of his fourth _RARE_ _RARE_ , while he was _RARE_ making wet _RARE_ on the _RARE_ with the bottom of the glass , he became aware that he was not alone . STO
* He looked up with _RARE_ eyes and _RARE_ the stranger sitting across the table , smiling a secret smile at him , as if they were fellow _RARE_ . STO
* He hadn't even noticed -- what was his name ? STO
* Pete ? STO
* -- he hadn't seen him sit down . STO
* The man was _RARE_ , like a shadow , and made as much noise as a shadow . STO
* Haney felt like _RARE_ out of sight , but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry , dark little man . STO
* He began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing . STO
* Was he going to be _RARE_ from now on with a creep for a _RARE_ ? STO
* He'd have to start going to some of the other places again . STO
* In a low voice , almost _RARE_ , the man had asked Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back . STO
* He made the mistake of answering in an _RARE_ way , and instantly realized that his _RARE_ must have showed in his face or voice . STO
* Pete frowned slightly , then became sad and _RARE_ . STO
* Haney didn't want to encourage his company , but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow , to prevent possible trouble . STO
* But there was no trouble . STO
* The guy _RARE_ over his drink , obviously upset by _RARE_ lack of appreciation . STO
* To break the uncomfortable silence , Haney began to talk . STO
* In time , and two drinks later , he was _RARE_ bitterly about his wife , He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his _RARE_ -- it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes . STO
* When he paused to _RARE_ his throat , the stranger broke in . STO
* `` But why pay her bills ? STO
* If she runs around with other men , and if you hate her as you say , why not just divorce her '' ? STO
* Haney _RARE_ . STO
* `` That bitch would love a divorce '' , he _RARE_ . STO
* `` Then she'd get half of everything I have . STO
* _RARE_ property deal -- you know . STO
* I'd have to sell out my business to pay her off with her share . STO
* She can drop dead '' ! STO
* Pete nodded _RARE_ . STO
* `` Oh yes . STO
* Now I see . STO
* You must understand , I haven't been in this state too long . STO
* I came out here to _RARE_ . STO
* That's why I -- why I do a free job now and then . STO
* You should have told me about her before '' . STO
* Haney felt a _RARE_ of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again . STO
* Then a wild thought ran circles through his _RARE_ brain . STO
* Suppose -- just suppose this guy was really what he said he was ! STO
* A retired professional killer If he was just a nut , no harm was done . STO
* But if he was the real thing , he could do something about _RARE_ . STO
* He felt very _RARE_ , very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot . STO
* `` No _RARE_ intended '' , he said gently . STO
* `` But it's just that -- well , you know . STO
* The cops didn't suspect a thing , and I thought it was a coincidence . STO
* After all , I didn't know you , Pete . STO
* It could have been an accident '' . STO
* He shrugged casually . STO
* `` But if you say you managed it '' The stranger was _RARE_ . STO
* His eyes burned _RARE_ . STO
* `` Yes , yes '' , he muttered impatiently . STO
* `` Of course it looked like an accident . STO
* I always work it that way -- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi . STO
* Let me prove it , Phil . STO
* I think I can manage one more favor for you '' . STO
* He waited eagerly . STO
* Haney _RARE_ the liquor in the bottom of his glass . STO
* About halfway back Pops groped against a wall and stopped , pulled away two loosely _RARE_ wide boards at one end , and went through . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , he whispered ; ; `` floor _RARE_ about three feet down , so don't fall '' . STO
* I went through and down , into pitch darkness . STO
* He said , `` _RARE_ stay still . STO
* I'll pull the boards back and then get us a light . STO
* _RARE_ stay where you are '' . STO
* I _RARE_ stayed where I was while he fumbled around and then walked away . STO
* A moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle , and I could see . STO
* It was a big room , empty except for a few things of _RARE_ at the far end -- a wooden _RARE_ on which stood the candle , a spread out blanket , and an _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I looked back over my shoulder while I went to join him ; ; he'd hung another half of a blanket over the _RARE_ window so no light would show through . STO
* I took the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as I sat down beside him on the spread blanket . STO
* `` You first '' , I said . STO
* He drank and handed it back . STO
* `` _RARE_ place '' , I told him . STO
* `` Listen , I got a buddy I travel with , real nice guy named _RARE_ . STO
* I know where he is , right near here . STO
* Could he join the party and sleep here tonight too ? STO
* We'll both be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you '' . STO
* He hesitated a second , looking at the bottle , before he said `` _RARE_ '' , and I reassured him . STO
* `` He'll bring a bottle too , and I'll get another one or maybe two while I'm out . STO
* You can work on this one while I'm gone , kill it if you want '' . STO
* I took a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him . STO
* His `` _RARE_ '' was enthusiastic this time . STO
* He put the bottle down . STO
* `` _RARE_ over by the window while there's light , an' I'll put _RARE_ candle out . STO
* When _RARE_ come back I'll put it out _RARE_ till you're both inside '' . STO
* Charlie was waiting , leaning against a building front . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , I told him . STO
* `` But we got to go back to Fifth and get another bottle or two . STO
* On the way I'll give you the _RARE_ '' . STO
* On the way I gave him the _RARE_ . STO
* I bought another pint of _RARE_ and when we got back Pops let us in in the dark , put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again . STO
* I introduced my friend _RARE_ to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable . STO
* There was still a little , not much , left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it , and Charlie opened his . STO
* I was reminded , _RARE_ , by a poem of _RARE_ _RARE_ called The _RARE_ of Two Men by a Young _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , which _RARE_ himself read on a record against jazz background . STO
* The poem consisted of only two words , the word `` Wait '' , repeated over and over at irregular intervals and with different _RARE_ , and then the word `` Now '' ! STO
* And a _RARE_ final chord from the jazz group . STO
* This was the same , except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing _RARE_ . STO
* But we could wait all right ; ; there was no hurry . STO
* I said , `` Wait wait '' to Charlie and he grinned , _RARE_ the reference . STO
* We'd heard the record together once . STO
* The second bottle passed a few times . STO
* Pops was taking long ones , but not showing the effect yet . STO
* He seemed as drunk as when I'd first talked to him , but no _RARE_ . STO
* He had a capacity ; ; if we'd really been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine . STO
* About halfway through the second bottle , Charlie looked at me across Pops , who was sitting between us and asked `` Now '' ? STO
* I said , `` Wait '' , and handed the bottle to Pops for his final drink . STO
* When he handed it back and I had hold of it safely , Pops was looking toward me and I said `` Now '' , to Charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket , once . STO
* It was a lead pipe _RARE_ . STO
* There was a sound like the one you produce by _RARE_ a _RARE_ with your finger , only louder , and Pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise . STO
* Out cold , if not dead ; ; and he'd never known what hit him -- he'd never known that anything had hit him . STO
* I reached my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a _RARE_ , but Charlie said `` Wait '' ! STO
* -- and said it sharply , not as in the _RARE_ bit , but as an order -- so I stopped my hand and looked at him . STO
* He was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me . STO
* `` We don't want to know whether he's dead , yet . STO
* I _RARE_ that blow to be _RARE_ . STO
* To _RARE_ him and maybe or maybe not kill . STO
* You hit again about twice that hard before we know whether he's dead or not . STO
* That way we'll never know which of us really killed him and which was just the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ '' ? STO
* I dug him , I saw his point ; ; it made sense . STO
* I took the piece of pipe from _RARE_ hand and used it , harder than he had . STO
* The _RARE_ was louder , anyway , and I thought I heard bone crack . STO
* Charlie said , `` Good boy . STO
* That did it , if mine didn't . STO
* And we'll never know which . STO
* All right , now I'll give you a hand '' . STO
* We straightened Pops up and I made sure there was no trace of a _RARE_ . STO
* I nodded to Charlie . STO
* `` Let's put him down again the way he was . STO
* It's a more natural position '' . STO
* We did that . STO
* `` How do you feel '' ? STO
* Charlie asked me . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , I told him . STO
* `` What do you feel '' ? STO
* `` Nothing . STO
* Well maybe I'm _RARE_ . STO
* It was a kick , but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again , except for _RARE_ . STO
* But let's not talk about it _RARE_ until we're out of here . STO
* Now , first question : the bottles . STO
* Shall we take them all with us , or leave one '' ? STO
* `` Take them '' , I said . STO
* `` If we left one we'd have to wipe it for _RARE_ . STO
* Here's the picture we want to leave for the _RARE_ -- whenever the body gets found . STO
* This happened in the middle of a drinking _RARE_ with another bum . STO
* If they'd been working on a bottle or a _RARE_ he'd have taken it with him '' . STO
* `` Right . STO
* And he'd have taken the weapon with him too , so we take that . STO
* Now '' -- He looked around . STO
* `` I've been careful about _RARE_ . STO
* How about you '' ? STO
* `` Same . STO
* There are the boards over the window , of course , but they're not painted and too rough to take _RARE_ . STO
* Same goes for the rough _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* Besides , I doubt if the cops will even try dusting . STO
* They find dead _RARE_ every day , maybe they won't even _RARE_ him for the cause of death '' . STO
* `` We can't take a chance on that . STO
* We've got to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent . STO
* Our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets . STO
* Let's do that '' . STO
* We did that and found a dirty handkerchief , some matches and fourteen cents in change . STO
* We took the matches -- they were book matches and once they'd been touched might _RARE_ _RARE_ -- and the change . STO
* We discussed the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason to blow it out . STO
* The candle had been stuck on a tin _RARE_ so it wouldn't set fire to the _RARE_ when it _RARE_ out . STO
* A fire wouldn't have _RARE_ except that it would cause Pops to be found sooner . STO
* He might not be found for days , even weeks , otherwise . STO
* We went once more over every point , then _RARE_ . STO
* Being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger , and we weren't picked up by a cop . STO
* In fact , nobody saw us , cop or citizen . STO
* _RARE_ is a quiet street with no _RARE_ and was completely deserted at that hour . STO
* Which , if it matters , was one A.M. . STO
* Less than three hours ago we'd decided , in _RARE_ _RARE_ pad on _RARE_ , to commit a trial murder . STO
* It had gone like _RARE_ . STO
* Almost too _RARE_ , I found myself thinking , and then told myself that was ridiculous . STO
* How safe is too safe ? STO
* _RARE_ like that can get you into a _RARE_ pad . STO
* An hour later we were back in my _RARE_ pad , killing what had been left of the second pint . STO
* We decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow . STO
* Also our plans for me to commit _RARE_ murder and for him to commit mine . STO
* But we were really going to do it . STO
* We shook hands on it . STO
* We planned ahead only one step , a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could _RARE_ notes . STO
* I'd tell him everything I'd learned about _RARE_ habits and habitat , and he'd tell me the score on _RARE_ . STO
* We made the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at _RARE_ _RARE_ pad . STO
* Charlie would get there early because he had the key . STO
* From here on in , the less Charlie and I were seen together in public , or visited one _RARE_ rooms , the better . STO
* I was dead tired and slept _RARE_ , as far as I know _RARE_ . STO
* We met at _RARE_ and decided we were set to stay as long as it took , into or even through the evening , to talk things out . STO
* Charlie had brought food and we'd decided on no drinks . STO
* I'd brought along the _RARE_ pint from last night , but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking . STO
* I talked first , telling him everything I knew about _RARE_ and his house and domestic arrangements . STO
* I drew diagrams and floor plans ; ; he _RARE_ them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down . STO
* He gave me equivalent and even more detailed _RARE_ on _RARE_ , including diagrams -- one of the apartment building _RARE_ lived in and one of the apartment itself . STO
* He'd been there several times , back when , while he and _RARE_ had been friends , or at least not enemies . STO
* It didn't take us as long as we'd thought it might ; ; it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie said , `` Well , I guess that's it . STO
* Shall we _RARE_ a coin to see which of us goes first ? STO
* Or would you rather deal a hand of _RARE_ _RARE_ or play a game of _RARE_ _RARE_ , or what '' ? STO
* `` Wait a minute , Charlie '' , I said . STO
* `` One thing we haven't discussed , expense money . STO
* We'll need some at least , if only bus _RARE_ to the scene of the crime . STO
* And if you're as flat broke as I am , I think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work '' . STO
* He sighed . STO
* `` All right , I'll come clean . STO
* I've got a little _RARE_ for a _RARE_ day , and I guess this is _RARE_ enough . STO
* A couple of hundred . STO
* If you draw the short straw I'll _RARE_ you some bread , like fifty _RARE_ , before I take off to visit my sister in _RARE_ . STO
* Then , after I'm back , another fifty so you can put some _RARE_ on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while I take care of your seat cover boy '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* I took a deep breath , and the _RARE_ . STO
* `` In that case , let's not draw . STO
* I'll go to bat first . STO
* You'd have to wait till _RARE_ back from Mexico City and also while I set it up with _RARE_ to have her have an alibi for _RARE_ . STO
* So it wouldn't be for days or even a week before you could do anything . STO
* But your friend _RARE_ can go any time '' . STO
* He grinned and _RARE_ me on the shoulder . STO
* `` I was hoping you'd say that , _RARE_ . STO
* But I wouldn't have suggested it . STO
* Well -- in that case , I take off tomorrow morning for _RARE_ . STO
* And , in case , I brought the money with me '' . STO
* Now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers , merge without let . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ was and is and ever had been . STO
* Mike stopped to _RARE_ all his brother _RARE_ , the many _RARE_ on Mars , corporate and _RARE_ , the precious few on Earth -- the unknown powers of three on Earth that would be his to merge with and _RARE_ now that at last long waiting he _RARE_ and cherished himself . STO
* Mike remained in _RARE_ ; ; there was much to grok , loose ends to _RARE_ over and fit into his growing -- all that he had seen and heard and been at the _RARE_ Foster _RARE_ ( not just _RARE_ when he and Digby had come face to face alone ) why Bishop Senator _RARE_ made him _RARE_ uneasy , how Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ tasted like a water brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had _RARE_ _RARE_ in the jumping up and down and _RARE_ -- _RARE_ _RARE_ coming and going -- _RARE_ words troubled him most ; ; he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a _RARE_ , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in . STO
* The word `` church '' which turned up over and over again among _RARE_ words gave him _RARE_ difficulty ; ; there was no Martian concept to match it -- unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` God '' and `` _RARE_ '' and many other words and _RARE_ them to the _RARE_ of the only world he had known during _RARE_ then forced the concept back into English in that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal , by _RARE_ , by Digby . STO
* `` _RARE_ art God '' . STO
* He was closer to understanding it in English now , although it could never have the _RARE_ of the Martian concept it stood for . STO
* In his mind he spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the Martian word and felt closer _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ it like a student telling himself that the _RARE_ is in the _RARE_ he sank into _RARE_ . STO
* Before midnight he _RARE_ his heart , resumed normal breathing , ran down his check list , _RARE_ and sat up . STO
* He had been weary ; ; now he felt light and gay and _RARE_ , ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him . STO
* He felt a _RARE_ need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet . STO
* He stepped out into the hall , was delighted to encounter a water brother . STO
* `` Hi '' ! STO
* `` Oh . STO
* Hello , Mike . STO
* My , you look _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I feel fine ! STO
* Where is everybody '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* Ben and _RARE_ went home an hour ago and people started going to bed '' . STO
* `` Oh '' . STO
* Mike felt disappointed that _RARE_ had left ; ; he wanted to explain his new _RARE_ . STO
* `` I ought to be asleep , too , but I felt like a _RARE_ . STO
* Are you hungry '' ? STO
* `` Sure , I'm hungry '' ! STO
* `` Come on , there's some cold chicken and we'll see what else '' . STO
* They went downstairs , loaded a tray _RARE_ . STO
* `` Let's take it outside . STO
* It's plenty warm '' . STO
* `` A fine idea '' , Mike agreed . STO
* `` _RARE_ enough to _RARE_ -- real Indian summer . STO
* I'll switch on the _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Don't bother '' , Mike answered . STO
* `` I'll carry the tray '' . STO
* He could see in almost total darkness . STO
* Jubal said that his _RARE_ probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up , and Mike _RARE_ this was true but _RARE_ that there was more to it ; ; his _RARE_ parents had taught him to see . STO
* As for the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on _RARE_ _RARE_ but his water brothers had little _RARE_ for changes in temperature and pressure ; ; he was _RARE_ of their weakness , once he learned of it . STO
* But he was looking forward to snow -- seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual , as he had read -- walking barefoot , rolling in it . STO
* In the _RARE_ he was pleased with the warm night and the still more _RARE_ company of his water brother . STO
* `` Okay , take the tray . STO
* I'll switch on the _RARE_ lights . STO
* That'll be plenty to eat by '' . STO
* `` Fine '' . STO
* Mike liked having light up through the _RARE_ ; ; it was a goodness , beauty . STO
* They _RARE_ by the pool , then lay back on the grass and looked at stars . STO
* `` Mike , there's Mars . STO
* It is Mars , isn't it ? STO
* Or _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` It is Mars '' . STO
* `` Mike ? STO
* What are they doing on Mars '' ? STO
* He hesitated ; ; the question was too wide for the _RARE_ English language . STO
* `` On the side toward the horizon -- the southern hemisphere -- it is spring ; ; plants are being taught to grow '' . STO
* `` ' _RARE_ to grow ' '' ? STO
* He hesitated . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ plants to grow . STO
* I have helped him . STO
* But my people -- _RARE_ , I mean ; ; I now grok you are my people -- teach plants another way . STO
* In the other hemisphere it is growing _RARE_ and _RARE_ , those who stayed alive through the summer , are being brought into _RARE_ for _RARE_ and more growing '' . STO
* He thought . STO
* `` Of the humans we left at the _RARE_ , one has _RARE_ and the others are sad '' . STO
* Yes , I heard it in the news '' . STO
* Mike had not heard it ; ; he had not known it until asked . STO
* `` They should not be sad . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ T. W. Jones Food _RARE_ First Class is not sad ; ; the Old _RARE_ have cherished him '' . STO
* `` You knew him '' ? STO
* `` Yes . STO
* He had his own face , dark and beautiful . STO
* But he was _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Oh , dear ! STO
* Mike do you ever get _RARE_ ? STO
* For Mars '' ? STO
* `` At first I was _RARE_ '' , he answered . STO
* `` I was lonely always '' . STO
* He rolled toward her and took her in his arms . STO
* `` But now I am not lonely . STO
* I grok I shall never be lonely again '' . STO
* `` Mike darling '' -- They kissed , and went on kissing . STO
* Presently his water brother said _RARE_ . STO
* `` Oh , my ! STO
* That was almost worse than the first time '' . STO
* `` You are all right , my brother '' ? STO
* `` Yes . STO
* Yes indeed . STO
* _RARE_ me again '' . STO
* A long time later , by cosmic clock , she said , `` Mike ? STO
* Is that -- I mean , ' Do you know ' '' -- `` I know . STO
* It is for growing closer . STO
* Now we grow closer '' . STO
* `` Well I've been ready a long time -- goodness , we all have , but never mind , dear ; ; turn just a little . STO
* I'll help '' . STO
* As they _RARE_ , _RARE_ together , Mike said softly and triumphantly : `` _RARE_ art God '' . STO
* Her answer was not in words . STO
* Then , as their _RARE_ made them ever closer and Mike felt himself almost ready to _RARE_ her voice called him back : `` Oh ! STO
* Oh ! STO
* _RARE_ art God '' ! STO
* `` We grok God '' . STO
* 25 . STO
* On Mars humans were building pressure _RARE_ for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship . STO
* This went faster than scheduled as the _RARE_ were helpful . STO
* Part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a _RARE_ plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of Mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations . STO
* The Old _RARE_ neither helped nor _RARE_ this plan ; ; time was not yet . STO
* Their _RARE_ were approaching a violent _RARE_ that would shape Martian art for many _RARE_ . STO
* On Earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of _RARE_ marks and spaces ; ; Time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the _RARE_ _RARE_ Daily _RARE_ should be translated into the medium . STO
* A _RARE_ campaign opened to sell more sexual _RARE_ of plants and Mrs. Joseph ( `` _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' ) _RARE_ was quoted as saying : `` I would no more sit down without flowers on my table than without _RARE_ '' . STO
* A _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ , _RARE_ , announced in _RARE_ _RARE_ a newly discovered , ancient _RARE_ discipline for _RARE_ breathing which increased both _RARE_ and cosmic attraction between sexes . STO
* His _RARE_ were required to assume the _RARE_ _RARE_ dressed in _RARE_ _RARE_ while he read aloud from _RARE_ and an assistant _RARE_ examined their _RARE_ in another room -- nothing was stolen ; ; the purpose was less immediate . STO
* The President of the United States proclaimed the first Sunday in November as `` National _RARE_ Day '' and urged America to say it with flowers . STO
* A funeral parlor chain was _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , after secret _RARE_ , announced the _RARE_ second Major _RARE_ : Supreme Bishop Digby had been translated _RARE_ to Heaven and _RARE_ to _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Foster . STO
* The _RARE_ news had been held up pending _RARE_ confirmation of the _RARE_ of a new Supreme Bishop , _RARE_ _RARE_ -- a candidate accepted by the _RARE_ _RARE_ after lots had been cast repeatedly . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ published identical _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ and the Christian Science _RARE_ ignored it , Times of India _RARE_ at it , and the Manchester _RARE_ simply reported it -- the _RARE_ in England were few but extremely _RARE_ . STO
* Digby was not pleased with his promotion . STO
* The Man from Mars had interrupted him with his work half finished -- and that stupid _RARE_ _RARE_ was certain to _RARE_ it up . STO
* Foster listened with _RARE_ patience until Digby ran down , then said , `` Listen , junior , you're an angel now -- so forget it . STO
* _RARE_ is no time for _RARE_ . STO
* You too were a stupid _RARE_ until you _RARE_ me . STO
* _RARE_ you did well enough . STO
* Now that _RARE_ is Supreme Bishop he'll do all right , he can't help it . STO
* Same as with the _RARE_ . STO
* Some of them were _RARE_ until they got promoted . STO
* _RARE_ with one of them , go ahead -- there's no professional _RARE_ here '' . STO
* Digby calmed down , but made one request . STO
* Foster shook his _RARE_ . STO
* `` You can't touch him . STO
* You shouldn't have tried to . STO
* Oh , you can submit a _RARE_ for a _RARE_ if you want to make a fool of yourself . STO
* But , I'm telling you , it'll be turned down -- you don't understand the System yet . STO
* The _RARE_ have their own setup , different from ours , and as long as they need him , we can't touch him . STO
* They run their show their way -- the _RARE_ has variety , something for everybody -- a fact you field workers often miss '' . STO
* `` You mean this _RARE_ can brush me aside and I've got to hold still for it '' ? STO
* `` I held still for the same thing , didn't I ? STO
* I'm helping you now , am I not ? STO
* Now look , there's work to be done and lots of it . STO
* The _RARE_ wants performance , not _RARE_ . STO
* If you need a Day off to calm down , duck over to the _RARE_ _RARE_ and take it . STO
* Otherwise , _RARE_ your _RARE_ , square your wings , and dig in . STO
* The sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll feel _RARE_ . STO
* Get _RARE_ , junior '' ! STO
* Digby _RARE_ a deep _RARE_ sigh . STO
* `` Okay , I'm _RARE_ . STO
* Where do I start '' ? STO
* Jubal did not hear of _RARE_ disappearance when it was announced , and , when he did , while he had a _RARE_ suspicion , he dismissed it ; ; if Mike had had a finger in it , he had gotten away with it -- and what happened to supreme _RARE_ worried Jubal not at all as long as he wasn't bothered . STO
* His household had gone through an upset . STO
* Jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom -- and didn't want to _RARE_ . STO
* Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , it was high time the boy was _RARE_ . STO
* Jubal couldn't _RARE_ the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting -- _RARE_ _RARE_ D , then _RARE_ _RARE_ A or _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , or _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , through all ways that four women can gang up on each other . STO
* This continued most of the week following that _RARE_ trip to church , during which period Mike stayed in his room and usually in a _RARE_ so deep that Jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before . STO
* Jubal would not have _RARE_ it if service had not gone to pieces . STO
* The girls seemed to spend half their time _RARE_ in `` to see if Mike was all right '' and they were too _RARE_ to cook , much less be _RARE_ . STO
* Even _RARE_ Anne -- Hell , Anne was the worst ! STO
* _RARE_ , subject to _RARE_ tears Jubal would have bet his life that if Anne were to witness the Second _RARE_ , she would _RARE_ date , time , _RARE_ , events , and _RARE_ pressure without batting her calm blue eyes . STO
* The expense and time involved are astronomical . STO
* However , we sent a third vessel out , a much smaller and faster one than the first two . STO
* We have learned much about interstellar _RARE_ since a hundred years ago ; ; that is all I can tell you about them . STO
* `` But the third ship came back several years ago and reported '' `` That it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already _RARE_ by _RARE_ beings '' ! STO
* Said Hal , _RARE_ in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak . STO
* Macneff stopped _RARE_ to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes . STO
* `` How did you know '' ? STO
* He said sharply . STO
* `` _RARE_ me , _RARE_ '' , said Hal . STO
* `` But it was inevitable ! STO
* Did not the _RARE_ _RARE_ in his Time and the World Line that such a planet would be found ? STO
* I believe it was on page _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Macneff smiled and said , `` I am glad that your _RARE_ lessons have left such an impression '' . STO
* How could they not ? STO
* _RARE_ Hal . STO
* Besides , they were not the only impressions . STO
* I still bear scars on my back where _RARE_ , my gapt , whipped me because I had not learned my lessons well enough . STO
* He was a good _RARE_ , that _RARE_ . STO
* Was ? STO
* Is ! STO
* As I grew older and was promoted , so was he , always where I was . STO
* He was my gapt in the _RARE_ . STO
* He was the _RARE_ gapt when I went to college and thought I was getting away from him . STO
* He is now my block gapt . STO
* He is the one responsible for my getting such low M. _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , came the _RARE_ , the protest . STO
* No , not he , for I , and I alone , am responsible for whatever happens to me . STO
* If I get a low M. R. , I do so because I want it that way or my dark self does . STO
* If I die , I die because I _RARE_ it so . STO
* So , forgive me , _RARE_ , for the _RARE_ thoughts ! STO
* `` Please pardon me again , _RARE_ '' , said Hal . STO
* `` But did the expedition find any records of the _RARE_ having been on this planet ? STO
* Perhaps , even , though this is too much to wish , find the _RARE_ himself '' ? STO
* `` No '' , said Macneff . STO
* `` Though that does not mean that there may not be such records there . STO
* The expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to Earth . STO
* I can't tell you now the distance in _RARE_ or what star this was , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere . STO
* If you _RARE_ , you will be told where you're going after the ship leaves . STO
* And it leaves very soon '' . STO
* `` You need a linguist '' ? STO
* Said Hal . STO
* `` The ship is huge '' , said Macneff , `` but the number of military men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one . STO
* We have considered several of your professionals because they were _RARE_ and above suspicion . STO
* Unfortunately '' Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning . STO
* Then , he said , `` Unfortunately , only one _RARE_ linguist exists , and he is too old for this expedition . STO
* Therefore '' `` A thousand _RARE_ '' , said Hal . STO
* `` But I have just thought of one thing . STO
* I am married '' . STO
* `` No problem at all '' , said Macneff . STO
* `` There will be no women aboard the Gabriel . STO
* And , if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce '' . STO
* Hal gasped , and he said , `` A divorce '' ? STO
* Macneff raised his hands _RARE_ and said , `` You are _RARE_ , of course . STO
* But , from our reading of the Western _RARE_ , we _RARE_ believe that the _RARE_ , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce . STO
* It's inevitable in this case , for the couple will be separated for , at the least , forty years . STO
* _RARE_ , he _RARE_ the provision in obscure language . STO
* In his great and _RARE_ wisdom , he knew that our enemies the _RARE_ must not be able to read therein what we planned '' . STO
* `` I _RARE_ '' , said Hal . STO
* `` Tell me more , _RARE_ '' . STO
* Six months later , Hal _RARE_ stood in the observation dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth _RARE_ above him . STO
* It was night on this hemisphere , but the light _RARE_ from the _RARE_ of Australia , Japan , China , _RARE_ Asia , India , _RARE_ . STO
* Hal , the linguist , saw the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ in terms of the languages spoken therein . STO
* Australia , the _RARE_ Islands , Japan , and northern China were _RARE_ by those members of the _RARE_ Union that spoke American . STO
* Southern China , all of _RARE_ Asia , southern India and _RARE_ , these states of the _RARE_ _RARE_ spoke _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ spoke _RARE_ . STO
* His mind turned the _RARE_ swiftly for him , and he _RARE_ Africa , which used _RARE_ south of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* All around the _RARE_ _RARE_ , Asia _RARE_ , northern India , and _RARE_ , _RARE_ was the native tongue . STO
* In southern Europe , between the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March . STO
* This was no man's land , _RARE_ by the _RARE_ Union and the _RARE_ Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years . STO
* Neither nation would give up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second _RARE_ War . STO
* So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( _RARE_ outside its own _RARE_ ) . STO
* Its citizens spoke all of the world's _RARE_ _RARE_ , plus a new one called _RARE_ , a _RARE_ whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose _RARE_ was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper . STO
* Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , the _RARE_ Islands , and the eastern half of South America . STO
* Here the peoples spoke the tongue of _RARE_ because that island had gotten the jump on the _RARE_ who were busy _RARE_ North America and the western half of South America after the _RARE_ War . STO
* Then there was North America , where American was the native speech of all except the twenty _RARE_ of _RARE_ living on the Hudson Bay _RARE_ . STO
* Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night _RARE_ , _RARE_ City would _RARE_ out into space . STO
* And , somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment . STO
* But Mary would soon no longer be living there , for she would be _RARE_ in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to _RARE_ . STO
* She would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her _RARE_ way , though in public she would be _RARE_ . STO
* Her friends and professional _RARE_ would _RARE_ with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought _RARE_ . STO
* If Hal _RARE_ had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way . STO
* There was no such thing as an `` accident '' . STO
* Somehow , all the other _RARE_ ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate _RARE_ to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die . STO
* And , therefore , being in _RARE_ , they would not be _RARE_ and their _RARE_ flung to the winds in public ceremony . STO
* No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the _RARE_ cared . STO
* Hal felt sorry for Mary ; ; he had a time keeping the tears from _RARE_ to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome . STO
* Yet , he told himself , this was the best way . STO
* He and Mary would no longer have to tear and _RARE_ at each other ; ; their _RARE_ _RARE_ would be over . STO
* Mary was free to marry again , not knowing that the _RARE_ had _RARE_ given her a divorce , thinking that death had dissolved her marriage . STO
* She would have a year in which to make up her mind , to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt . STO
* Perhaps , the psychological barriers that had prevented her from _RARE_ _RARE_ child would no longer be present . STO
* Perhaps . STO
* Hal doubted if this happy event would occur . STO
* Mary was as frozen below the _RARE_ as he . STO
* No matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt The gapt . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* He would no longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice `` Hal _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Said the whining voice . STO
* And , slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , Hal turned . STO
* There was the squat _RARE_ man , smiling _RARE_ up at him . STO
* `` My beloved ward , my _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , said the whining voice . STO
* `` I had no idea that you , too , would be on this _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But I might have known ! STO
* We seem to be bound by love ; ; _RARE_ himself must have foreseen it . STO
* Love to you , my ward '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ love you , too , my _RARE_ '' , said Hal , choking . STO
* `` How wonderful to see your cherished self . STO
* I had thought we would never again speak to each other '' . STO
* 5 the Gabriel pointed towards her destination and , under _RARE_ acceleration , began to build up towards her ultimate velocity , _RARE_ percent of the speed of light . STO
* Meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the _RARE_ . STO
* Here they would lie in suspended _RARE_ for many years . STO
* Some time later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others . STO
* They would sleep while the _RARE_ drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the _RARE_ bodies of the personnel could not have endured . STO
* Upon reaching the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would _RARE_ towards the star which was its _RARE_ end . STO
* Many years later , the _RARE_ apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Again , a force too strong for _RARE_ bodies to _RARE_ would be applied . STO
* Then , after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* And the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended _RARE_ . STO
* These members would then _RARE_ the rest of the personnel . STO
* And , in the _RARE_ left before reaching their destination , the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed . STO
* Hal _RARE_ was among the last to go into the _RARE_ and among the first to come out . STO
* He had to study the _RARE_ of the language of the chief nation of _RARE_ , Siddo . STO
* And , from the first , he faced a difficult task . STO
* The expedition that had discovered _RARE_ had succeeded in _RARE_ two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words . STO
* The description of the Siddo _RARE_ was very restricted . STO
* And , as Hal found out , obviously mistaken in many cases . STO
* This discovery caused Hal anxiety . STO
* His duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak _RARE_ . STO
* Yet , if he used all of the little means at his disposal , he would be _RARE_ his students _RARE_ . STO
* Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult . STO
* For one thing , the _RARE_ of speech of the _RARE_ _RARE_ differed somewhat from _RARE_ ; ; the sounds made by these _RARE_ were , therefore , _RARE_ . STO
* It was true that they could be _RARE_ , but would the _RARE_ understand these _RARE_ ? STO
* Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo . STO
* Consider the tense system . STO
* Instead of _RARE_ a _RARE_ or using an _RARE_ particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word . STO
* Thus , the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , meaning to live , was , in the perfect tense , _RARE_ , and , in the future , _RARE_ . STO
* The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the fact that Siddo not only had the normal ( to Earthmen ) three _RARE_ of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , but the two extra of _RARE_ and spiritual . STO
* Fortunately , _RARE_ was _RARE_ , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo . STO
* The system of indicating _RARE_ varied according to tense . STO
* All the other parts of speech : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ operated under the same system as the verbs . STO
* This was not , for the Angel , just a matter of running through a logical or _RARE_ chain , or deciding on some action from some already established _RARE_ . STO
* No doubt the Angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer . STO
* What Gabriel was being asked to do now , however , was to _RARE_ all his basic assumptions , make _RARE_ on them , and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives . STO
* This is not wholly a reasoning process -- a computer cannot do it all -- and even in an Angel it takes time . STO
* ( Or , perhaps , especially in an Angel , whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago . STO
* ) Being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause , however , did not make it seem any less long to Jack . STO
* He had already become used to _RARE_ snapping back answers to questions almost before Jack could get them asked . STO
* There was nothing he could do but wait . STO
* The dice were cast . STO
* At last Gabriel spoke . STO
* `` We _RARE_ you '' , he said slowly . STO
* `` We had concluded that no race as _RARE_ as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice . STO
* Of course we have before us the example of the great races at the _RARE_ center ; ; individually they are nearly as _RARE_ as you -- the difference does not seem very marked to us , where it exists . STO
* But they have survived for long periods as races , whereas you are young . STO
* We shall recommend to them that they _RARE_ your trial period by half . STO
* `` For now , it is clear that we were in the wrong . STO
* You may _RARE_ your property , and the penalty on Hesperus is lifted . STO
* Hesperus , you may speak '' . STO
* `` I did not perceive this essential distinction either , _RARE_ '' , Hesperus said at once , `` I was only _RARE_ a concept that Jack taught me , called a deal '' . STO
* `` Nevertheless , you were its agent . STO
* Jack , what is the nature of this concept '' ? STO
* `` It's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , Jack said . STO
* `` We regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given '' . STO
* His heart , he discovered , was _RARE_ . STO
* `` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth . STO
* Between individuals , this process is called bargaining . STO
* When it is done between races or nations , it is called making a treaty . STO
* And the major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine . STO
* _RARE_ the property was much less important '' . STO
* `` Strange '' , Gabriel said . STO
* `` And apparently impossible . STO
* Though it might be that we would have much to give you , you have nothing to give us '' . STO
* `` Hesperus and _RARE_ '' , Jack said , `` show that we do '' . STO
* Another pause ; ; but this one was not nearly as long . STO
* `` Then it is a matter of pleasure ; ; of curiosity ; ; of a more alive time . STO
* Yes , those could be commodities under this concept . STO
* But you should understand , Jack , that Hesperus and _RARE_ are not long out of the nursery . STO
* _RARE_ the Earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older '' . STO
* This explained a great deal . STO
* `` All the more reason , then '' , Jack said , `` why we must have a treaty . STO
* We will _RARE_ _RARE_ your young and give them proper living quarters , in return for their help in running our fusion reactors . STO
* But we must know if this is in accordance with your customs , and must have your agreement they will not _RARE_ the power we put in their hands , to our hurt '' . STO
* `` But this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the _RARE_ of their own _RARE_ , and respect yours in turn . STO
* To this we of course agree '' . STO
* Jack felt a wave of complete _RARE_ , but in a second it had vanished without a trace . STO
* What Gabriel was asking was that mankind _RARE_ all its _RARE_ moral judgments , and contract to let the Angels serve on Earth as it is in Heaven regardless of the applicable Earth laws . STO
* The Angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the Earthmen -- but they had no _RARE_ notion of man's _RARE_ habit of passing and _RARE_ laws which were contrary to his own _RARE_ and _RARE_ of his nature . STO
* The simple treaty principle that Gabriel was asking him to _RARE_ , in short , was nothing less than total trust . STO
* Nothing less would serve . STO
* And it might be , considering the uncomfortable _RARE_ the Angels had of thinking of everything in terms of _RARE_ , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a _RARE_ of war . STO
* Furthermore , even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of Jack's total _RARE_ could not understand how the principle could ever be _RARE_ . STO
* Almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion , not trust , as the _RARE_ and _RARE_ attitude toward all outsiders . STO
* Yet there was some _RARE_ for it . STO
* The history of _RARE_ agreements , for instance , had been _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; but the United States and the Union of Soviet _RARE_ _RARE_ nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test _RARE_ , and a sort of _RARE_ acceptance of each other's good intentions on this limited question . STO
* Out of that agreement , though not by any easy road , eventually emerged the present world _RARE_ of the United Nations ; ; suspicion between member states still existed , but it was of about the same low order of _RARE_ as the _RARE_ _RARE_ between _RARE_ and California over water supplies . STO
* Besides , agreements `` in principle '' , with the _RARE_ details to be _RARE_ out later , were commonplace in _RARE_ history . STO
* The trouble with them was that they almost never worked , and in fact an agreement `` in principle '' _RARE_ turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled . STO
* Suppose that this one were to work ? STO
* There was no question in Jack's mind of the good faith on one side , at least . STO
* If mankind could be convinced of that It was worth trying . STO
* In fact , it had to be tried . STO
* It would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that Earth had ever signed . STO
* Secretary _RARE_ had taught Jack , at least partially , to be content with small beginnings in all _RARE_ matters ; ; but there was no small way to handle this one . STO
* He turned back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips . STO
* But he was too late . STO
* He had lost his audience . STO
* For a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw . STO
* It seemed to be only a _RARE_ of color , light and meaningless activity . STO
* _RARE_ , he realized that the _RARE_ of Angel _RARE_ had vanished , and that the _RARE_ learning dance of the nursery had been broken up . STO
* The Angels in the nursery were _RARE_ wildly in all directions , seemingly at random . STO
* `` Hesperus ! STO
* What's going on here ? STO
* What's happened '' ? STO
* `` Your brothers have been found . STO
* They are on their way here '' . STO
* `` Where ? STO
* I don't see them . STO
* The instruments don't show them '' . STO
* `` You can't see them yet , Jack . STO
* They'll be in range in a short while '' . STO
* Jack scanned the _RARE_ , the boards , and the _RARE_ again . STO
* Nothing . STO
* No -- there was a tiny _RARE_ on the radar ; ; and it was getting bigger rapidly . STO
* If that was the skiff , it was making unprecedented speed . STO
* Then the skiff _RARE_ into sight , just a dot of light at first against the _RARE_ blackness and _RARE_ streaks of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Through the _RARE_ , Jack could see that both _RARE_ were still attached to it . STO
* The _RARE_ was still _RARE_ , though there were a good many holes in it , as _RARE_ had predicted would be the case by now . STO
* It was a startling , almost _RARE_ sight ; ; but even more _RARE_ was the fact that it was _RARE_ an enormous _RARE_ of Angels . STO
* The skiff was not heading for the nursery , however . STO
* It seemed unlikely that her crew , if either of them were alive , could even see the _RARE_ , for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a _RARE_ . STO
* And there would be no chance of _RARE_ them -- without the _RARE_ generator Jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static , and by the time he could _RARE_ his fusion power the skiff would be gone . STO
* _RARE_ , helpless , he watched them pass him . STO
* The _RARE_ , ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars . STO
* He would never have believed , without seeing it , that the _RARE_ little vessel could go so fast . STO
* But where was it going ? STO
* And why was it causing so much _RARE_ among the Angels , and being followed by so many of them ? STO
* There was only one possible answer , but Jack's _RARE_ mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar _RARE_ of the _RARE_ course into the computer . STO
* The curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldn't be argued with , however . STO
* The skiff was headed for the very center of the _RARE_ -- toward that place which , Jack knew now , could hold nothing less important than the very core of the _RARE_ life and religion . STO
* It was clear that _RARE_ had at last found a way to attract the _RARE_ attention . STO
* It was equally clear that as of this moment , the treaty was off . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ 10 _RARE_ would have to be headed off , whether he knew where he was going or not . STO
* Almost surely he did ; ; after all , he had had the same set of facts as Jack had had to work from , and he was an almost _RARE_ _RARE_ man . STO
* But not having talked to the Angels , he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line . STO
* Had he decided , perhaps , that the center of the cloud was a center of government , instead of a center of life and faith '' ? STO
* But it didn't matter now whether he meant to _RARE_ the Holy of _RARE_ , or was simply headed in that direction by accident . STO
* If it was intentional , it was now also unnecessary ; ; and whether intentional or not , the outcome would be _RARE_ . STO
* Jack crawled under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had _RARE_ from the _RARE_ generator switch . STO
* When he was back on his feet again and about to _RARE_ the _RARE_ , however , he hesitated . STO
* He had to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff , and he had to have it fast . STO
* But fusion power in the _RARE_ _RARE_ was what had _RARE_ all the trouble in the first place -- and he already had an Angel aboard . STO
* `` Hesperus '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I'm going to turn my generator back on , as I promised to do . STO
* But I can't take you to Earth yet . STO
* First I've got to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble . STO
* Will you _RARE_ this , or will you help ? STO
* I know it's not part of the bargain , and your _RARE_ might not like it '' . STO
* `` Nobody else can live in your _RARE_ while I am in it '' , Hesperus said promptly . STO
* `` As for my _RARE_ , they have already admitted that they were wrong . STO
* If because of this incident they become angry with Earth , I will not be permitted to go there at all . STO
* Therefore of course I will help '' . STO
* With a _RARE_ sigh of relief , Jack _RARE_ the _RARE_ back in and threw the switch . STO
* Without an _RARE_ transition , the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board . STO
* Always before , it had taken five minutes to -- Of course . STO
* Hesperus was in there . STO
* From here on out , the _RARE_ was going to be hotter than any space _RARE_ man had ever dreamed of . STO
* But since he had failed to _RARE_ it , he lost the five minutes anyhow , in _RARE_ an intercept orbit . STO
* `` Hesperus , don't use this _RARE_ vector trick of yours , please . STO
* Ryan _RARE_ his bulk up and supported it on one elbow . STO
* He rubbed his eyes _RARE_ with one huge _RARE_ . STO
* `` Ekstrohm , Nogol , you guys okay '' ? STO
* `` Nothing wrong with me that couldn't be _RARE_ '' , Nogol said . STO
* He didn't say what would cure him ; ; he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself . STO
* His small black eyes darted inside the _RARE_ _RARE_ of his face . STO
* `` Ekstrohm '' ? STO
* Ryan insisted . STO
* `` Okay '' . STO
* `` Well , let's take a _RARE_ look at the country around here '' . STO
* The _RARE_ rolled open on the landscape . STO
* A range of _RARE_ _RARE_ the horizon , the color of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Above them , the sky was the black of space , or the almost equal black of the winter sky above _RARE_ , seen against _RARE_ snow . STO
* That cold , empty sky was full of fire and light . STO
* It seemed almost a magnification of the _RARE_ itself , of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ up by some master _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ _RARE_ was actually only a belt of minor planets , almost like the _RARE_ belt in the original _RARE_ System . STO
* These planets were much bigger , nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere . STO
* But to the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , for no known reason not all of them did . STO
* This would be the fifth mapping expedition to the _RARE_ of _RARE_ in three generations . STO
* They lay months away from the nearest Earth star by jump drive , and no one knew what they were good for , although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered -- much like the _RARE_ of _RARE_ in ancient history . STO
* `` How can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely '' ? STO
* Ryan asked . STO
* He was the captain , so he could ask questions like that . STO
* `` Some can be lonely in a crowd '' , Nogol said _RARE_ . STO
* `` What will we need outside , Ryan '' ? STO
* Ekstrohm asked . STO
* `` No _RARE_ '' , the captain answered . STO
* `` We can breathe out there , all right . STO
* It just won't be easy . STO
* This old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago . STO
* _RARE_ and oxygen are about it '' . STO
* `` Ryan , look over there '' , Nogol said . STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the ship . STO
* _RARE_ they're intelligent , maybe _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` I think they're dead '' , Ekstrohm _RARE_ quietly . STO
* `` I get no _RARE_ from them at all . STO
* _RARE_ , electronic , _RARE_ -- all blank . STO
* According to these _RARE_ , they're stone dead '' . STO
* `` Ekstrohm , you and I will have a look '' , Ryan said . STO
* `` You hold down the _RARE_ , Nogol . STO
* Take it easy '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Nogol confirmed . STO
* `` I heard a story once about a _RARE_ who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't get an _RARE_ reading on him . STO
* Me , I know the mind of an officer works in a strange and _RARE_ manner '' . STO
* `` I'm not worried about you _RARE_ the _RARE_ , Nogol , just about a _RARE_ like you reading them at all . STO
* Remember , when the little hand is straight up that's negative . STO
* _RARE_ results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark '' . STO
* `` But I'm _RARE_ '' . STO
* Ryan told him what he could do then . STO
* Ekstrohm smiled , and followed the captain through the _RARE_ with only a glance at the _RARE_ gauge on his _RARE_ . STO
* The strong negative field his suit set up would help to _RARE_ bacteria and insects . STO
* Actually , the types of _RARE_ that could attack a _RARE_ _RARE_ were not infinite , and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories . STO
* He wasn't likely to come down with hot _RARE_ and puzzling striped fever . STO
* They ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the _RARE_ gauge to judge surface resistance , dropped to the ground . STO
* It was day , but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow . STO
* They walked from midnight to noon , noon to midnight , and came to the beast sprawled on its side . STO
* Ekstrohm _RARE_ it with a boot . STO
* `` Hey , this is pretty close to a _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Ryan admitted . STO
* `` One of the best matches I've ever found . STO
* Well , it has to happen . STO
* _RARE_ average and all . STO
* Still , it sometimes gives you a _RARE_ feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping _RARE_ on some strange world . STO
* It makes you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke , and somebody has been everywhere before you even started '' . STO
* The _RARE_ looked sidewise at the captain . STO
* The big man seldom gave out with such thoughts . STO
* Ekstrohm cleared his throat . STO
* `` What shall we do with this one ? STO
* _RARE_ it '' ? STO
* Ryan _RARE_ it with his _RARE_ , following _RARE_ example . STO
* `` I don't know , _RARE_ . STO
* It sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to me . STO
* No hands , for one thing . STO
* Of course , that's not definite proof '' . STO
* `` No , it isn't '' , Ekstrohm said . STO
* `` I think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the _RARE_ setup around here . STO
* In the _RARE_ , we might be thinking on the problem all these dead _RARE_ represent . STO
* What killed them '' ? STO
* `` It looks like we did , when we made _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` But what about our landing was _RARE_ to the creatures '' ? STO
* `` Radiation '' ? STO
* Ekstrohm suggested . STO
* `` The planet is very low in radiation from _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output . STO
* Any little dose of radiation might knock off these _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I don't know about that . STO
* Maybe it would work the other way . STO
* Maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and don't have any _RARE_ stored up , they could take a lot without harm '' . STO
* `` Then maybe it was the _RARE_ we set up . STO
* Or maybe it's sheer _RARE_ . STO
* They _RARE_ up and die at the sight of something strange and alien -- like a _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Maybe '' , the captain admitted . STO
* `` At this stage of the game anything could be possible . STO
* But there's one possibility I particularly don't like '' . STO
* `` And that is '' ? STO
* `` Suppose it was not us that killed these _RARE_ . STO
* Suppose it is something right on the planet , native to it . STO
* I just hope it doesn't work on Earthmen too . STO
* These _RARE_ went real sudden '' . STO
* Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet . STO
* The Earthmen made camp outside the _RARE_ . STO
* There was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship , except that , faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground , they simply had to get out . STO
* The camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles , _RARE_ with a _RARE_ web to alert the Earthmen to the approach of any being . STO
* Each man had a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced _RARE_ on board the ship . STO
* Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* There was a _RARE_ of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground . STO
* _RARE_ there were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the morning sun . STO
* The bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration _RARE_ on board . STO
* Yet he knew the others were sleeping more _RARE_ , now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had _RARE_ them to send them riding high vacuum . STO
* Ekstrohm was not asleep . STO
* Now there could be an end to pretending . STO
* He threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk , to the floor . STO
* Ekstrohm stood up . STO
* There was no longer any need to hide . STO
* But what was there to do ? STO
* What had changed for him ? STO
* He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretending to sleep . STO
* In privacy he could walk around , leave the light on , read . STO
* It was small comfort for _RARE_ . STO
* Ekstrohm never slept . STO
* Some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this . STO
* Actually , they said , he did sleep , but so shortly and _RARE_ that he forgot . STO
* Others admitted he was absolutely correct -- he never slept . STO
* His body processes only slowed down enough for him to _RARE_ fatigue _RARE_ . STO
* Occasionally he fell into a waking , _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; but he never slept . STO
* Never at all . STO
* _RARE_ , he couldn't let his _RARE_ know this . STO
* _RARE_ would ground him from the _RARE_ Service , on physiological if not psychological grounds . STO
* He had to hide it . STO
* Over the years , he had had _RARE_ in space in whom he thought he could _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ invariably took advantage of him . STO
* Since he couldn't sleep anyway , he might as well stand their _RARE_ for them or write their reports . STO
* Where the hell did he get off threatening to report any _RARE_ on their part to the captain ? STO
* A man with _RARE_ had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him . STO
* Ekstrohm had to hide his secret . STO
* In a camp , instead of _RARE_ , hiding the secret was easier . STO
* But the secret itself was just as hard . STO
* Ekstrohm picked up a _RARE_ _RARE_ from the _RARE_ library , a book by _RARE_ , the famous _RARE_ century expert on sex . STO
* He scanned a few lines on the social _RARE_ of a _RARE_ nineteenth century sex murderer , but he couldn't seem to concentrate on the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ style . STO
* On impulse , he _RARE_ up the heat control on his _RARE_ and slid back the hatch of the bubble . STO
* Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar _RARE_ , _RARE_ the frozen _RARE_ of the thin air . STO
* Behind him , his _RARE_ stirred without waking . STO
* Ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a _RARE_ on the hatch of his bubble . STO
* It took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order , and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting , _RARE_ . STO
* The angry _RARE_ face of Ryan greeted him . STO
* `` Okay , _RARE_ , this isn't the place for fun and games . STO
* What did you do with them '' ? STO
* `` Do with what '' ? STO
* `` The dead _RARE_ . STO
* All the dead animals laying around the ship '' . STO
* `` What are you talking about , Ryan ? STO
* What do you think I did with them '' ? STO
* `` I don't know . STO
* All I know is that they are gone '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Ekstrohm _RARE_ his way outside and scanned the _RARE_ . STO
* There was no ring of animal _RARE_ . STO
* Nothing . STO
* Nothing but _RARE_ grass whipping in the keen breeze . STO
* `` I'll be damned '' , Ekstrohm said . STO
* `` You are right now , buddy . STO
* _RARE_ doesn't like anybody _RARE_ up primary evidence '' . STO
* `` Where do you get off , Ryan '' ? STO
* Ekstrohm demanded . STO
* `` Why pick me for your _RARE_ ? STO
* This has got to be some kind of local phenomenon . STO
* Why accuse a _RARE_ of being behind this '' ? STO
* `` Listen , Ekstrohm , I want to give you the benefit of every doubt . STO
* But you aren't exactly the model of a _RARE_ , you know . STO
* You've been riding on a pink ticket for six years , you know that '' . STO
* `` No '' , Ekstrohm said , `` No , I didn't know that '' . STO
* `` You've been hiding things from me and Nogol every jump we've made with you . STO
* Now comes this ! STO
* It _RARE_ the pattern of _RARE_ and _RARE_ you've been involved in '' . STO
* `` What could I do with your lousy dead bodies ? STO
* What would I want with them '' ? STO
* `` All I know is that you were outside the bubbles last night , and you were the only _RARE_ being who came in or out of our alarm web . STO
* The _RARE_ show that . STO
* Now all the bodies are missing , like they got up and walked away '' . STO
* It was not a new experience to Ekstrohm . STO
* No . STO
* _RARE_ wasn't new to him at all . STO
* `` Ryan , there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies . STO
* Look for them , will you ? STO
* I give you my word I'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke , or to deliberately _RARE_ up the expedition . STO
* Take my word , can't you '' ? STO
* Ryan shook his head . STO
* `` I don't think I can . STO
* There's still such a thing as mental illness . STO
* You may not be responsible '' . STO
* Ekstrohm _RARE_ . STO
* `` Don't try anything violent , _RARE_ . STO
* I _RARE_ you fifty pounds and I'm fast for a big man '' . STO
* `` I wasn't planning on jumping you . STO
* Why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong ? STO
* She lived and was given a name . STO
* Helva . STO
* For her first three _RARE_ months she waved her _RARE_ _RARE_ , kicked _RARE_ with her _RARE_ feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant . STO
* She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city's special nursery . STO
* Soon they all were removed to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began . STO
* One of the babies died in the initial _RARE_ but of Helva's `` class '' , seventeen _RARE_ in the metal shells . STO
* Instead of kicking feet , Helva's _RARE_ responses started her wheels ; ; instead of _RARE_ with hands , she _RARE_ mechanical _RARE_ . STO
* As she _RARE_ , more and more _RARE_ _RARE_ would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship . STO
* For Helva was _RARE_ to be the `` brain '' half of a scout ship , _RARE_ with a man or a woman , _RARE_ she chose , as the mobile half . STO
* She would be among the elite of her kind . STO
* Her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high . STO
* As long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations , and there were no _RARE_ from the pituitary _RARE_ , Helva would live a _RARE_ , rich and unusual life , a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary , `` normal '' being . STO
* However , no _RARE_ of her brain patterns , no early I.Q. tests recorded certain essential facts about Helva that Central must eventually learn . STO
* They would have to _RARE_ their official time and see , _RARE_ that the massive doses of _RARE_ would _RARE_ her , too , as the necessary _RARE_ against her unusual _RARE_ and the pressures of her profession . STO
* A ship run by a human brain could not run _RARE_ or insane with the power and resources Central had to build into their scout ships . STO
* _RARE_ ships were , of course , long past the experimental stages . STO
* Most _RARE_ survived the techniques of pituitary _RARE_ that kept their bodies small , eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells . STO
* And very , very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial _RARE_ . STO
* Shell people resembled mature _RARE_ in size whatever their _RARE_ _RARE_ were , but the _RARE_ brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the _RARE_ . STO
* So , for happy years , Helva _RARE_ around in her shell with her _RARE_ , playing such games as _RARE_ , _RARE_ , studying her lessons in _RARE_ , _RARE_ techniques , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , mental _RARE_ , basic alien _RARE_ , _RARE_ , space history , law , traffic , codes : all the et _RARE_ that eventually became _RARE_ into a reasoning , logical , informed citizen . STO
* Not so obvious to her , but of more importance to her teachers , Helva _RARE_ the _RARE_ of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her _RARE_ fluid . STO
* She would one day be grateful to the patient _RARE_ of the _RARE_ instruction . STO
* Helva's civilization was not without busy , _RARE_ associations , _RARE_ possible _RARE_ to terrestrial as well as _RARE_ citizens . STO
* One such group got all _RARE_ over _RARE_ `` children '' when Helva was just turning fourteen . STO
* When they were forced to , Central _RARE_ shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the Laboratory _RARE_ and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case _RARE_ , complete with photographs . STO
* Very few committees ever looked past the first few _RARE_ . STO
* Most of their original objections about `` shells '' were _RARE_ by the relief that these hideous ( to them ) bodies were _RARE_ concealed . STO
* Helva's class was doing Fine _RARE_ , a selective subject in her crowded program . STO
* She had _RARE_ one of her _RARE_ tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel . STO
* Her subject was large -- a copy of the Last Supper -- and her canvas , small -- the head of a tiny screw . STO
* She had _RARE_ her sight to the proper degree . STO
* As she worked she _RARE_ _RARE_ , producing a curious sound . STO
* Shell people used their own vocal _RARE_ and _RARE_ but sound issued through _RARE_ rather than mouths . STO
* Helva's _RARE_ then had a curious _RARE_ , a warm , _RARE_ quality even in its _RARE_ chromatic _RARE_ . STO
* `` Why , what a lovely voice you have '' , said one of the female visitors . STO
* Helva `` looked '' up and caught a fascinating _RARE_ of regular , dirty _RARE_ on a _RARE_ pink surface . STO
* Her _RARE_ became a _RARE_ of surprise . STO
* She instinctively _RARE_ her `` sight '' until the skin lost its _RARE_ look and the _RARE_ assumed normal proportions . STO
* `` Yes , we have quite a few years of voice training , _RARE_ '' , remarked Helva calmly . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ often become _RARE_ _RARE_ during prolonged _RARE_ distances and must be eliminated . STO
* I enjoyed my lessons '' . STO
* Although this was the first time that Helva had seen _RARE_ people , she took this experience calmly . STO
* Any other reaction would have been reported instantly . STO
* `` I meant that you have a nice singing voice dear '' , the lady amended . STO
* `` Thank you . STO
* Would you like to see my work '' ? STO
* Helva asked , politely . STO
* She instinctively _RARE_ away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Asked the lady . STO
* `` I am currently _RARE_ the Last Supper on the head of a screw '' . STO
* `` No , I say '' , the lady _RARE_ . STO
* Helva turned her vision back to magnification and _RARE_ her copy _RARE_ . STO
* `` Of course , some of my color values do not match the old _RARE_ and the perspective is _RARE_ but I believe it to be a fair copy '' . STO
* The _RARE_ eyes , _RARE_ , _RARE_ out . STO
* `` Oh , I forget '' , and Helva's voice was really _RARE_ . STO
* If she could have blushed , she would have . STO
* `` You people don't have _RARE_ vision '' . STO
* The _RARE_ of this _RARE_ grinned with pride and _RARE_ as Helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate . STO
* `` Here , this will help '' , suggested Helva , _RARE_ a _RARE_ device in one extension and holding it over the picture . STO
* In a kind of shock , the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ executed Last Supper on the head of a screw . STO
* `` Well '' , remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife , `` the good Lord can eat where angels fear to _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Are you referring , sir '' , asked Helva politely , `` to the Dark Age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin '' ? STO
* `` I had that in mind '' . STO
* `` If you substitute ' atom ' for ' angel ' , the problem is not insoluble , given the metallic content of the pin in question '' . STO
* `` Which you are _RARE_ to _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Of course '' . STO
* `` Did they remember to program a sense of humor , as well , young lady '' ? STO
* `` We are directed to develop a sense of proportion , sir , which contributes the same effect '' . STO
* The good man _RARE_ _RARE_ and decided the trip was worth his time . STO
* If the investigation committee spent months _RARE_ the thoughtful food served them at the Laboratory School , they left Helva with a _RARE_ as well . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' as applicable to herself required research . STO
* She had , of course , been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ de _RARE_ '' , the atomic age _RARE_ , Eileen _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , as well as the curious _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ visual _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* But `` singing '' for any shell person _RARE_ considerable technical difficulties to be overcome . STO
* Shell people were _RARE_ to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ properly between optimism and _RARE_ , the _RARE_ attitude of the shell people led them to _RARE_ themselves , their ships and personnel , from _RARE_ situations . STO
* Therefore to Helva , the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her . STO
* She would work out a method , _RARE_ her limitations , whereby she could sing . STO
* She approached the problem by _RARE_ the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and _RARE_ . STO
* Her own sound production equipment was essentially more _RARE_ than vocal . STO
* _RARE_ control and the proper _RARE_ of vowel sounds within the oral _RARE_ appeared to require the most development and practice . STO
* Shell people did not , strictly speaking , breathe . STO
* For their purposes , oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained _RARE_ by solution in their shells . STO
* After experimentation , Helva discovered that she could _RARE_ her _RARE_ unit to sustain tone . STO
* By _RARE_ the throat muscles and expanding the oral _RARE_ well into the _RARE_ _RARE_ , she could direct the vowel sounds into the most _RARE_ position for proper reproduction through her throat _RARE_ . STO
* She compared the results with tape _RARE_ of modern _RARE_ and was not _RARE_ although her own _RARE_ had a peculiar quality about them , not at all _RARE_ , merely unique . STO
* _RARE_ a _RARE_ from the Laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall . STO
* She found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy . STO
* It would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ as she pleased . STO
* It was , to Helva , only a matter of the correct reproduction and _RARE_ control required by the music attempted . STO
* If the authorities remarked on her curious _RARE_ , they did so among themselves . STO
* Shell people were encouraged to develop a _RARE_ so long as they maintained _RARE_ in their technical work . STO
* On the anniversary of her _RARE_ year in her shell , Helva was _RARE_ _RARE_ and installed in her ship , the Aj . STO
* Her permanent _RARE_ shell was _RARE_ behind an even more _RARE_ barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship . STO
* The _RARE_ , _RARE_ , visual and _RARE_ connections were made and sealed . STO
* Her _RARE_ were _RARE_ , connected or _RARE_ and the final , _RARE_ brain _RARE_ were completed while Helva remained _RARE_ unaware of the proceedings . STO
* When she awoke , she was the ship . STO
* Her brain and intelligence controlled every function from _RARE_ to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed . STO
* She could take care of herself and her _RARE_ half , in any situation already recorded in the _RARE_ of Central _RARE_ and any situation its most _RARE_ minds could imagine . STO
* Her first actual flight , for she and her kind had made mock flights on _RARE_ panels since she was eight , showed her complete _RARE_ of the techniques of her profession . STO
* She was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner . STO
* There were nine qualified _RARE_ sitting around collecting base pay the day Helva was _RARE_ . STO
* There were several missions which demanded instant attention but Helva had been of interest to several department heads in Central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section . STO
* Consequently no one had remembered to introduce Helva to the prospective partners . STO
* The ship always chose its own partner . STO
* Had there been another `` brain '' ship at the Base at the moment , Helva would have been guided to make the first move . STO
* As it was , while Central _RARE_ among itself , Robert _RARE_ sneaked out of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , out to the field and over to Helva's _RARE_ metal _RARE_ . STO
* `` Hello , anyone at home '' ? STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` Of course '' , replied Helva logically , _RARE_ her outside _RARE_ . STO
* `` Are you my partner '' ? STO
* She asked hopefully , as she recognized the _RARE_ Service uniform . STO
* `` All you have to do is ask '' , he _RARE_ hopefully . STO
* `` No one has come . STO
* I thought perhaps there were no partners available and I've had no _RARE_ from Central '' . STO
* Even to herself Helva sounded a little _RARE_ but the truth was she was lonely , sitting on the darkened field . STO
* Always she had had the company of other shells and more recently , _RARE_ by the score . STO
* The sudden _RARE_ had lost its _RARE_ charm and become _RARE_ . STO
* `` No _RARE_ from Central is scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys _RARE_ their _RARE_ to the quick just waiting for an _RARE_ to board you , you beautiful thing '' . STO
* It would have killed you in the cabin . STO
* Do you have anything for me '' ? STO
* Mercer _RARE_ , not knowing what B'dikkat meant , and the _RARE_ man answered for him , `` I think he has a nice baby head , but it isn't big enough for you to take yet '' . STO
* Mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm . STO
* B'dikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the _RARE_ hit Mercer . STO
* He tried to run after B'dikkat , to _RARE_ the lead _RARE_ , to tell B'dikkat that he loved him . STO
* He stumbled and fell , but it did not hurt . STO
* The _RARE_ girl lay near him . STO
* Mercer spoke to her . STO
* `` Isn't it wonderful ? STO
* You're beautiful , beautiful , beautiful . STO
* I'm so happy to be here '' . STO
* The woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them . STO
* She _RARE_ warmth and good _RARE_ . STO
* Mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming . STO
* He struggled out of his clothes . STO
* It was foolish and _RARE_ to wear clothing when none of these nice people did . STO
* The two women _RARE_ and _RARE_ at him . STO
* With one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing , just expressing the _RARE_ of a drug so powerful that the known universe had _RARE_ it . STO
* With most of his mind he was happy . STO
* He wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this . STO
* He tried to tell the Lady Da , but the words weren't quite straight . STO
* A painful _RARE_ hit him in the _RARE_ . STO
* The drug went after the pain and swallowed it . STO
* It was like the cap in the hospital , only a thousand times better . STO
* The pain was gone , though it had been _RARE_ the first time . STO
* He forced himself to be deliberate . STO
* He _RARE_ his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay _RARE_ nude beside him in the desert , `` That was a good bite . STO
* Maybe I will grow another head . STO
* That would make B'dikkat happy '' ! STO
* The Lady Da forced the _RARE_ of her bodies in an upright position . STO
* Said she , `` I'm strong , too . STO
* I can talk . STO
* Remember , man , remember . STO
* People never live forever . STO
* We can die , too , we can die like real people . STO
* I do so believe in death '' ! STO
* Mercer smiled at her through his happiness . STO
* `` Of course you can . STO
* But isn't this nice '' With this he felt his lips _RARE_ and his mind go _RARE_ . STO
* He was wide awake , but he did not feel like doing anything . STO
* In that beautiful place , among all those _RARE_ and attractive people , he sat and smiled . STO
* B'dikkat was _RARE_ his _RARE_ . STO
* Mercer wondered how long the _RARE_ had lasted him . STO
* He endured the _RARE_ of the dromozoa without _RARE_ or movement . STO
* The _RARE_ of nerves and _RARE_ of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him , but meant nothing . STO
* He watched his own body with remote , casual interest . STO
* The Lady Da and the _RARE_ woman stayed near him . STO
* After a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms . STO
* Having arrived he blinked _RARE_ and _RARE_ at them , and _RARE_ back into the _RARE_ _RARE_ from which he had emerged . STO
* Mercer saw the sun rise on occasion , closed his eyes briefly , and opened them to see stars shining . STO
* Time had no meaning . STO
* The dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way ; ; the drug canceled out his needs for _RARE_ of the body . STO
* At last he noticed a return of the _RARE_ of pain . STO
* The _RARE_ themselves had not changed ; ; he had . STO
* He knew all the events which could take place on _RARE_ . STO
* He remembered them well from his happy period . STO
* _RARE_ he had noticed them -- now he felt them . STO
* He tried to ask the Lady Da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again . STO
* She smiled at him with _RARE_ , remote happiness ; ; apparently her many _RARE_ , stretched out along the ground , had a greater capacity for _RARE_ the drug than did his body . STO
* She meant him well , but was in no condition for _RARE_ speech . STO
* The half-man lay on the ground , arteries _RARE_ _RARE_ behind the _RARE_ film which protected his _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Mercer squeezed the man's shoulder . STO
* The half-man woke , recognized Mercer and gave him a _RARE_ sleepy grin . STO
* `` ' A good _RARE_ to you , my boy . STO
* That's out of a play . STO
* Did you ever see a play '' ? STO
* `` You mean a game with cards '' ? STO
* `` No '' , said the half-man , `` a sort of _RARE_ with real people doing the figures '' . STO
* `` I never saw that '' , said Mercer , `` but I '' -- `` But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going to come back with the needle '' . STO
* `` Yes '' , said Mercer , a little ashamed of his _RARE_ . STO
* `` Soon '' , said the half-man . STO
* That's why I think of plays . STO
* We all know what is going to happen . STO
* We all know when it is going to happen . STO
* We all know what the _RARE_ will do '' -- he _RARE_ at the _RARE_ in which the _RARE_ men were _RARE_ -- `` and we all know what the new people will ask . STO
* But we never know how long a scene is going to take '' . STO
* `` What's a ' scene ' '' ? STO
* Asked Mercer . STO
* `` Is that the name for the needle '' ? STO
* The half-man laughed with something close to real humor . STO
* `` No , no , no . STO
* You've got the _RARE_ on the brain . STO
* A scene is just a part of a play . STO
* I mean we know the order in which things happen , but we have no _RARE_ and nobody _RARE_ enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes . STO
* The pain seems short and the pleasure seems long . STO
* I'm inclined to think that they are about two _RARE_ each '' . STO
* Mercer did not know what an `` _RARE_ '' was , since he had not been a _RARE_ man before his conviction , but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time . STO
* The half-man received a _RARE_ _RARE_ , turned red in the face , shouted _RARE_ at Mercer , `` Take it out , you fool ! STO
* Take it out of me '' ! STO
* When Mercer looked on _RARE_ , the half-man twisted over on his side , his pink dusty back turned to Mercer , and wept _RARE_ and quietly to himself . STO
* Mercer himself could not tell how long it was before B'dikkat came back . STO
* It might have been several days . STO
* It might have been several months . STO
* Once again B'dikkat moved among them like a father ; ; once again they _RARE_ like children . STO
* This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of _RARE_ thigh -- a sleeping child's head , covered with light hair on top and with _RARE_ eyebrows over the resting eyes . STO
* Mercer got the _RARE_ needle . STO
* When B'dikkat cut the head from _RARE_ thigh , he felt the knife grinding against the _RARE_ which held the head to his own body . STO
* He saw the _RARE_ _RARE_ as the head was cut ; ; he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat _RARE_ the wound with a _RARE_ _RARE_ which stopped all bleeding immediately . STO
* The next time it was two legs growing from his chest . STO
* Then there had been another head beside his own . STO
* Or was that after the _RARE_ and legs , waist to _RARE_ , of the little girl which had grown from his side ? STO
* He forgot the order . STO
* He did not count time . STO
* Lady Da smiled at him often , but there was no love in this place . STO
* She had lost the extra _RARE_ . STO
* In between _RARE_ , she was a pretty and _RARE_ woman ; ; but the _RARE_ thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope , `` People never live forever '' . STO
* She found this immensely comforting , even though Mercer did not make much sense out of it . STO
* Thus events occurred , and _RARE_ changed in appearance , and new ones arrived . STO
* Sometimes B'dikkat took the new ones , resting in the _RARE_ sleep of their _RARE_ brains , in a _RARE_ to be added to other _RARE_ . STO
* The bodies in the truck _RARE_ and _RARE_ without human speech when the dromozoa struck them . STO
* Finally , Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin . STO
* He had to fight the _RARE_ of _RARE_ to do it . STO
* Only the memory of previous hurt , _RARE_ and _RARE_ made him sure that if he did not ask B'dikkat when he , Mercer , was happy , the answer would no longer be available when he needed it . STO
* _RARE_ pleasure itself , he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there . STO
* B'dikkat grudgingly agreed , but he did not come out of the doorway . STO
* He spoke through the public address box built into the cabin , and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain , so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend B'dikkat might be wanting to tell them . STO
* When he said it , they thought it exceedingly profound , though none of them understood it , since it was simply the amount of time that Mercer had been on _RARE_ : `` Standard years -- _RARE_ years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes . STO
* Good luck , fellow '' . STO
* Mercer turned away . STO
* The secret little corner of his mind , which stayed _RARE_ through happiness and pain , made him wonder about B'dikkat . STO
* What persuaded the _RARE_ to remain on _RARE_ ? STO
* What kept him happy without _RARE_ ? STO
* Was B'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day , surrounded by a family of little _RARE_ _RARE_ himself ? STO
* Mercer , despite his happiness , wept a little at the strange fate of B'dikkat . STO
* His own fate he accepted . STO
* He remembered the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan . STO
* The dromozoa kept him alive , but he did not know how they did it . STO
* He staggered back to the group . STO
* The Lady Da , naked in the dusty plain , waved a _RARE_ hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her . STO
* There were _RARE_ square miles of _RARE_ space around them , but he appreciated the _RARE_ of her gesture none the less . STO
* 4 , The years , if they were years , went by . STO
* The land of _RARE_ did not change . STO
* Sometimes the _RARE_ sound of _RARE_ came faintly across the plain to the herd of men ; ; those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of Captain _RARE_ . STO
* There was night and day , but no setting of _RARE_ , no change of season , no generations of men . STO
* Time stood still for these people , and their load of pleasure was so _RARE_ with the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the dromozoa that the words of the Lady Da took on very remote meaning . STO
* `` People never live forever '' . STO
* Her statement was a hope , not a truth in which they could believe . STO
* They did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to _RARE_ the experience of each for the wisdom of all . STO
* There was no dream of escape for these people . STO
* Though they saw the _RARE_ chemical _RARE_ lift up from the field beyond _RARE_ cabin , they did not make plans to hide among the frozen _RARE_ of _RARE_ flesh . STO
* Far long ago , some other _RARE_ than one of these had tried to write a letter . STO
* His _RARE_ was on a rock . STO
* Mercer read it , and so had a few of the others , but they could not tell which man had done it . STO
* Nor did they care . STO
* The letter , scraped on stone , had been a message home . STO
* They could still read the opening : `` Once , I was like you , _RARE_ out of my window at the end of day , and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place I lived in . STO
* Once , like you , I had one head , two hands , ten fingers on my hands . STO
* The front part of my head was called a face , and I could talk with it . STO
* Now I can only write , and that only when I get out of pain . STO
* Dan Morgan told himself he would forget Ann _RARE_ . STO
* He was well rid of her . STO
* He certainly didn't want a wife who was _RARE_ as Ann . STO
* If he had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble . STO
* But all of this was _RARE_ . STO
* Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann , and then could not get back to sleep . STO
* His plans and dreams had _RARE_ around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing . STO
* The _RARE_ thing would be to sell out to _RARE_ _RARE_ and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it . STO
* The best _RARE_ for the bitterness and disappointment that _RARE_ him was hard work . STO
* He found that if he was tired enough at night , he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake . STO
* Each day he found himself thinking less often of Ann ; ; each day the hurt was a little _RARE_ , a little less _RARE_ . STO
* He had plenty of work to do . STO
* Because the summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years . STO
* The grass in the _RARE_ came fast , now that the warm weather was here . STO
* He could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spent most of his waking hours along the _RARE_ in his _RARE_ . STO
* He had no idea how much time _RARE_ would give him . STO
* In any case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence . STO
* He stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each day dragging out with _RARE_ calm . STO
* When , in late afternoon on the last day in June , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle . STO
* It could be some kind of trick _RARE_ had thought up . STO
* No one walked in this country , least of all Ed _RARE_ or Dutch _RARE_ or any of the rest of the Bar B crew . STO
* Morgan watched the two figures for a time , puzzled . STO
* When they were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever . STO
* He cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his Winchester , and started _RARE_ . STO
* His visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , _RARE_ toward the house . STO
* Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and _RARE_ , _RARE_ , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet . STO
* _RARE_ the house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands . STO
* They crawled through the north fence and came on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more than nineteen or twenty . STO
* They were dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door . STO
* She lay there , making no effort to get back on her feet . STO
* The boy came on to the porch and sat down , his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring . STO
* Morgan hesitated , thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one . STO
* He didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending . STO
* The boy licked his dry lips . STO
* He asked , `` Could we have a drink '' ? STO
* Morgan jerked his head toward the front door . STO
* `` In the kitchen '' , he said . STO
* _RARE_ his Winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl . STO
* `` Get up . STO
* There's water in the house '' . STO
* She didn't move or say anything . STO
* Her eyes were _RARE_ as if she didn't hear or even see him . STO
* She had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked . STO
* Her face was very thin , and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling , the new skin under it red and angry . STO
* Her blond hair was _RARE_ , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection . STO
* It must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was _RARE_ and bleeding . STO
* He picked her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house . STO
* She was _RARE_ light , and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious . STO
* Any _RARE_ suspicion that this was a trick _RARE_ _RARE_ had thought up was _RARE_ . STO
* No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him . STO
* Besides , she had a sweet face that attracted him . STO
* He put her down on the couch , and going into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table . STO
* They looked a good deal alike , Morgan thought . STO
* Both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features . STO
* Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth . STO
* She drank _RARE_ , and murmured , `` Thank you '' , as he lowered her head . STO
* He stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition . STO
* He had seen a few _RARE_ wagons go through the country , the families almost _RARE_ to death , but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two . STO
* The girl dropped off to sleep . STO
* Morgan returned to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several _RARE_ of water from the spring which he poured into the _RARE_ _RARE_ that he had placed on the stove . STO
* He brought his Winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy . STO
* `` Who are you and what happened to you '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` I'm Billy Jones '' , the boy answered . STO
* `` That's my wife _RARE_ . STO
* We ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days '' . STO
* `` What are you doing here '' ? STO
* `` Are we in Wyoming '' ? STO
* Morgan nodded . STO
* `` About five miles north of the line '' . STO
* Jones sighed as if relieved . STO
* `` We've been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down '' . STO
* `` You mean you dragged your wife all over _RARE_ _RARE_ looking for work '' ? STO
* Morgan demanded . STO
* `` The town of _RARE_ only about six miles from here . STO
* Why didn't you go there '' ? STO
* `` We didn't want town work '' , Jones said . STO
* `` This is a mighty empty country '' , Morgan said . STO
* `` There's only one more ranch three miles north of here . STO
* You'd have _RARE_ to death if you'd missed both places '' . STO
* `` Then we're lucky we got here . STO
* Could you give us a job , Mr. '' `` Morgan . STO
* Dan Morgan '' . STO
* He was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the _RARE_ , but he knew nothing about the couple . STO
* They might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house . STO
* He dismissed the possibility at once . STO
* The girl's thin face haunted him . STO
* It wasn't the face of a killer . STO
* He wasn't so sure about the boy . STO
* He hadn't shaved for several weeks , his _RARE_ beard giving his face a _RARE_ , _RARE_ expression . STO
* There was more to this than Jones had told him . STO
* They were running from something . STO
* He'd be an _RARE_ to let them stay he thought , but he couldn't send them on , either . STO
* `` I could use some help '' , Morgan said finally , `` but I can't afford to pay you anything . STO
* I guess you'd better go on in the morning '' . STO
* `` We'll work for our keep '' , the boy said eagerly . STO
* `` I've been _RARE_ in a mine in the San Juan , but I used to work on a ranch . STO
* _RARE_ , she's cooked in a restaurant . STO
* We'll work hard , Mr. Morgan '' . STO
* `` I'll see '' , Morgan said . STO
* `` Right now you need a meal and a bath . STO
* Your wife's in terrible shape '' . STO
* `` I know '' , Jones said _RARE_ . STO
* Morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table . STO
* When the meal was ready , he told Jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl . STO
* He said , `` I've got some supper ready '' . STO
* She rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair . STO
* `` I'm a mess '' , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed . STO
* `` Who are you ? STO
* How did we get here '' ? STO
* `` I'm Dan Morgan . STO
* This is the _RARE_ Aj . STO
* You fell down in front of the house , and I carried you in . STO
* I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep '' . STO
* `` Oh '' . STO
* She stared at him , her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said ; ; then she murmured : `` You're very kind , Mr. Morgan . STO
* Do you take in all the _RARE_ who come by '' ? STO
* `` I don't have many _RARE_ coming to my front door '' , he said . STO
* `` _RARE_ you can walk to the table '' ? STO
* `` Of course '' . STO
* She got to her feet , staggered , and almost fell . STO
* He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen . STO
* She sat down at the table , shaking her head . STO
* `` I'm sorry , Mr. Morgan . STO
* I'm usually a very strong woman , but I'm awfully tired '' . STO
* `` And hungry '' , he said . STO
* `` _RARE_ in . STO
* It's not much of a meal , but it's what I eat '' . STO
* `` Not much of a meal '' ? STO
* The girl cried . STO
* `` Mr. Morgan , it's the _RARE_ food I ever saw '' . STO
* He told himself he had never seen two people eat so much . STO
* When they were finally satisfied , Jones said , `` I think he's going to give us work '' . STO
* The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself . STO
* When he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn't send them on . STO
* She said , `` I guess the Lord looks out for _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ '' . STO
* Morgan laughed . STO
* `` Which are you '' ? STO
* `` We're not _RARE_ '' , she said . STO
* `` That's all I'm sure of '' . STO
* She helped him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark . STO
* He carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall . STO
* He said : `` You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath . STO
* Your feet are in bad shape , Mrs. Jones . STO
* You'll have to go to town to see the _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` No , _RARE_ be all right '' , Jones said quickly . STO
* `` I mean , we don't have any way to get there and we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town '' . STO
* `` We'll see '' , Morgan said . STO
* `` Could you find me a needle and thread '' ? STO
* The girl asked . STO
* `` My dress needs some work on it '' . STO
* He nodded and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and _RARE_ . STO
* He said : `` I'm going to bed '' . STO
* He nodded at the door in front of him . STO
* `` That's my spare bedroom . STO
* The bed isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there '' . STO
* `` You're awfully kind '' , the girl said . STO
* `` We'll pay you back if you'll let us . STO
* Some way '' . STO
* `` It's all right '' , he said . STO
* `` I get up early . STO
* You'd better sleep '' . STO
* Jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him . STO
* He said : `` If it's all right with you , Mr. Morgan , I'll sleep out here on the couch . STO
* We haven't slept together since we started . STO
* I just can't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together '' He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , `` I understand that , but I don't _RARE_ why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place '' . STO
* `` We got fired '' , Jones said . STO
* `` We had to do something '' . STO
* They were a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed . STO
* Gavin paused wearily . STO
* `` You can't stay here with me . STO
* It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn '' . STO
* `` You can't make me go '' . STO
* Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock . STO
* He was thinking of _RARE_ and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the _RARE_ . STO
* It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt . STO
* _RARE_ his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and _RARE_ of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see . STO
* Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known . STO
* _RARE_ that other man he could _RARE_ his anger ; ; against this bent man in the chair he was _RARE_ . STO
* Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to _RARE_ to catch the words . STO
* `` Do you remember Big Charlie '' ? STO
* He whispered . STO
* `` He stuck with me all these years . STO
* Just a half-breed _RARE_ , never said much , never meant _RARE_ to me , but he stuck with me . STO
* He got into a fight with Tom English , your brother's son . STO
* It was a fair fight , the boy _RARE_ it -- Big Charlie told me so . STO
* I believed him . STO
* They killed Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago . STO
* My men , they all left me . STO
* Just cleared out . STO
* I didn't understand why , Clay . STO
* They just all cleared out . STO
* I treated them fair '' He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder . STO
* `` Do you mean '' -- he asked almost _RARE_ -- `` you want me to go with you , wherever you're _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Yes '' . STO
* `` You don't hate me any more '' ? STO
* Clayton _RARE_ , shook his head , _RARE_ , `` No '' . STO
* `` Come here '' . STO
* The old man _RARE_ with one finger and Clayton went forward to him . STO
* Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and _RARE_ him _RARE_ . STO
* `` All my life '' , he said , `` I tried . STO
* I tried . STO
* I saw you _RARE_ away -- but I tried . STO
* And you wanted no part of me when I had so much to give . STO
* Now there's _RARE_ left of me . STO
* _RARE_ is gone , my men are gone , Ed is dead -- and you come to me , to help me . STO
* Oh ! STO
* God in Heaven , I can't refuse you now . STO
* That would mock me too much ! STO
* Can't let you go way from me again '' He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears . STO
* `` I'll go , Clay '' . STO
* Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back . STO
* The eyes followed him _RARE_ . STO
* `` The horses . STO
* There isn't much time . STO
* I'll saddle the horses and bring them round . STO
* You get ready '' He burst from the hot _RARE_ of the room into the cold night air . STO
* Gavin's _RARE_ was in the barn and he tightened the _RARE_ over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words . STO
* When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch . STO
* The _RARE_ had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to _RARE_ the _RARE_ , shaking his head . STO
* Clayton _RARE_ the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck . STO
* The mare had backed away . STO
* `` You take it easy , boy '' , Clayton whispered . STO
* `` She doesn't want you now . STO
* You take it easy , your time will come '' . STO
* Gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure . STO
* He had taken a _RARE_ down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock _RARE_ on the wood floor . STO
* Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps . STO
* `` Clay '' , he said , `` where are we _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` To a ranch in the valley . STO
* There's someone there I have to see . STO
* We may take her with us -- to California . STO
* I don't know yet , it's crazy ; ; I have to think about it . STO
* But California is where we're _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` California '' . STO
* Gavin began to nod . STO
* `` That's a new land . STO
* A man could make a mark there . STO
* Two men , together like us , we could do _RARE_ fine out there , maybe find a place where no one's ever been . STO
* _RARE_ out fresh , the two of us , like _RARE_ had ever happened '' . STO
* `` Yes , like a father and son '' . STO
* `` I made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered . STO
* `` I made you so you could stand up . STO
* I made you a man '' . STO
* `` Yes , Gavin , you did '' . STO
* He approached the horse and laid a hand on the _RARE_ quivering neck . STO
* `` Help me up , Clay . STO
* Help me up , I feel kind of stiff '' . STO
* Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child . STO
* `` I hate to leave my garden '' , Gavin said . STO
* `` They'll _RARE_ it down . STO
* I loved my garden '' . STO
* `` It will grow again -- in California '' . STO
* `` I loved this valley '' , he whispered _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ alone here for three years , before any man came . STO
* _RARE_ alone by the river . STO
* It was nice then , so peaceful and quiet . STO
* There was no one but me . STO
* I don't want to leave it '' . STO
* Clayton swung into the saddle and _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness . STO
* _RARE_ they rode at a measured pace through the valley . STO
* _RARE_ would come soon and the night was at its _RARE_ . STO
* The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked _RARE_ , as if no man had ever _RARE_ before . STO
* It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his _RARE_ and _RARE_ suddenly to the _RARE_ of an _RARE_ or the _RARE_ of a blade of grass in the _RARE_ wind -- a savage land , _RARE_ and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men . STO
* Gavin sighed bitterly . STO
* In that inert landscape the _RARE_ of his desires passed before his mind . STO
* He saw them _RARE_ , _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of the broken and the dying . STO
* In _RARE_ his mind groped to _RARE_ the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life . STO
* The silence _RARE_ him , made him bend low over the _RARE_ neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search . STO
* They passed _RARE_ that were framed dark gray against the black hills . STO
* Then at last the darkness began to _RARE_ . STO
* A bold line of _RARE_ broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky . STO
* The _RARE_ light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first _RARE_ the contours of trees and fences and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though _RARE_ eyes of two men _RARE_ a few hundred yards away in the _RARE_ shelter of the trees . STO
* The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence . STO
* The men in _RARE_ were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and _RARE_ . STO
* But the liquor had flushed their courage . STO
* They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been _RARE_ of purpose . STO
* Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire . STO
* He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked . STO
* `` He's _RARE_ . STO
* That's what you wanted , isn't it ? STO
* Clayton is with him , _RARE_ him out of the valley . STO
* You can't '' -- `` Keep out of this '' , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` He's not your brother , he's Gavin's son . STO
* You see , he _RARE_ to us when he said he was _RARE_ alone '' . STO
* Joe _RARE_ was thinking back many years . STO
* First he thought of the time he had _RARE_ to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being _RARE_ at the far end of the valley . STO
* He remembered Gavin's _RARE_ , his own _RARE_ feeling , his _RARE_ . STO
* Then he thought of a time when _RARE_ horse had fallen _RARE_ in the _RARE_ . STO
* His wife had said to him : `` Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy . STO
* He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party . STO
* He treats her like she was dirt . STO
* And you stand by like a fool and let him do it '' He remembered _RARE_ _RARE_ smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water . STO
* It was the night Clayton had _RARE_ them in the _RARE_ game . STO
* `` You're Gavin's son '' , Joe _RARE_ had said . STO
* He turned to Lester . STO
* `` You brought him back to this valley _RARE_ he would help you find your boy . STO
* He meant to help Gavin all the time . STO
* He made a fool of you , Lester '' . STO
* He swung round to the other men -- `` We can catch him easy ! STO
* There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place . STO
* If we let them go , they won't stay away , they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back . STO
* There's only one way they can get out now and that's through the _RARE_ -- if we ride hard we can take them '' . STO
* _RARE_ hand _RARE_ to _RARE_ shoulder . STO
* The boy jerked away . STO
* `` He killed Tom -- do you understand that '' ? STO
* _RARE_ turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the _RARE_ warmth of the saloon into the cold of the _RARE_ night . STO
* He fled through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ were the last to leave . STO
* They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance . STO
* _RARE_ in the cold dawn the mist _RARE_ low to the ground , then rose with a _RARE_ of sudden wind to leave the valley clear . STO
* The clouds parted and hard _RARE_ of sunlight _RARE_ down to _RARE_ the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses _RARE_ like dark streams over the _RARE_ snow . STO
* When they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , _RARE_ out on the _RARE_ in a flat black line . STO
* The wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were _RARE_ and their _RARE_ _RARE_ like stiff black _RARE_ in the wind . STO
* The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's _RARE_ . STO
* He looked over his shoulder at the thin _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* They neither gained nor fell back . STO
* He rode low on the _RARE_ neck . STO
* _RARE_ of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the _RARE_ , no more than a mile away . STO
* Gavin's face was _RARE_ with excitement . STO
* He did not look back ; ; he could feel more than hear the _RARE_ beat of hoofs that _RARE_ out across the _RARE_ to the north . STO
* He knew who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , _RARE_ their _RARE_ to him . STO
* Now they were riding to kill him . STO
* And he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time . STO
* The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley . STO
* With every _RARE_ stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again . STO
* The _RARE_ looming before him -- the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him . STO
* California is too far , he thought . STO
* He would never reach California . STO
* He was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of _RARE_ that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life . STO
* The _RARE_ was not dead . STO
* He was , in fact , showing signs of _RARE_ . STO
* He had been carrying an _RARE_ rifle and a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ pistol . STO
* A bayonet hung in a belt _RARE_ . STO
* He was partially _RARE_ in a _RARE_ _RARE_ and hat . STO
* Mike stripped these from him and _RARE_ them . STO
* He and Dean tied and _RARE_ the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose . STO
* They dragged him inside the building . STO
* Fiske joined them , _RARE_ on his feet . STO
* Julia , seeing the _RARE_ , rushed to him . STO
* `` You are hurt '' ! STO
* She breathed . STO
* `` I never felt better in my life '' , Fiske _RARE_ . STO
* He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek . STO
* `` Thank you , My dear '' , he said . STO
* `` You are very brave '' . STO
* Mike _RARE_ them . STO
* `` We'll talk later . STO
* First , we've got to get out of here '' . STO
* `` We'll grab horses '' , Dean said . STO
* `` The main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall '' . STO
* Mike _RARE_ it , trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride . STO
* But it at least offered him a chance for living . STO
* He had none here . STO
* And , for the sake of Julia and Susan , it had to be tried . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ remained silent . STO
* Light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground . STO
* Someone evidently was on duty there . STO
* No doubt there would be men guarding the horses . STO
* About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best Mike could make out in the moonlight . STO
* _RARE_ this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency . STO
* He handed the _RARE_ rifle to Fiske . STO
* `` Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he said . STO
* `` We'll _RARE_ the rest . STO
* You stay with the ladies . STO
* All of you be ready to ride hell for leather '' . STO
* He added , `` If this doesn't work out , the three of you _RARE_ yourself in the house and talk terms with them '' . STO
* He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol . STO
* Susan halted Dean and kissed him . STO
* She clung to him , talking to him , and _RARE_ at her eyes . STO
* Mike turned away . STO
* He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had . STO
* He felt _RARE_ weary . STO
* Dean turned from Susan and took Julia _RARE_ in his arms . STO
* He kissed her also , and with deep _RARE_ . STO
* She too began to weep . STO
* He released her and joined Mike . STO
* `` All right '' , he said . STO
* Mike only said , `` Later '' . STO
* `` Be careful , _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Susan said _RARE_ . STO
* `` The way you were careful '' ? STO
* He _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ around in the moonlight almost naked and _RARE_ a man with a rock '' ? STO
* He kept going . STO
* He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her . STO
* He might say or do something foolish . STO
* Something all of them would regret . STO
* He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way Julia _RARE_ had taken _RARE_ _RARE_ from her . STO
* And using him , Mike _RARE_ , as a _RARE_ to her pride . STO
* He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol . STO
* `` _RARE_ well back of me '' , he said . STO
* `` I'm going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I'm one of the guerrillas . STO
* There's bound to be someone on guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close '' . STO
* _RARE_ the pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade . STO
* It was _RARE_ by a wagon gate built of two wings . STO
* One wing stood open . STO
* Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses . STO
* They were _RARE_ , army style , on stable lines . STO
* A voice spoke _RARE_ . STO
* `` Who's that '' ? STO
* Just me '' , Mike said . STO
* `` Is that you , Bill '' ? STO
* He located his man . STO
* The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight . STO
* Mike kept walking and got within _RARE_ reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol . STO
* But the luck that had been running their way left him . STO
* The guard instinctively _RARE_ the blow with his rifle . STO
* He tried to _RARE_ the rifle around to fire into Mike's body . STO
* Mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it _RARE_ . STO
* The bullet went wide . STO
* Mike swung the pistol in a savage _RARE_ . STO
* This time it connected solidly on the man's temple , _RARE_ him . STO
* The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep _RARE_ were still rolling in the hills . STO
* The startled horses began _RARE_ on their _RARE_ . STO
* Dean came _RARE_ up . STO
* `` Are you hit '' ? STO
* He demanded . STO
* `` No , but the _RARE_ in the fire '' ! STO
* Mike said . STO
* `` There's no chance now of all of us getting away . STO
* You'll have to try it alone '' . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ horse stood _RARE_ nearby , having been kept _RARE_ in case of need . STO
* Mike took the bayonet from _RARE_ hand and slashed the picket line . STO
* `` Up you go '' ! STO
* He said . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse . STO
* `` Why not you '' ? STO
* He protested . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Mike said frantically . STO
* `` You're lighter than me . STO
* It's our only chance now . STO
* Try to find these _RARE_ . STO
* The rest of us can _RARE_ up in the house and hang on until you get back . STO
* You're the one that's taking the big chance '' . STO
* Dean still hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost _RARE_ into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand . STO
* `` No telling how good this horse is '' , Mike _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ him and save something in case you hit trouble . STO
* _RARE_ out for _RARE_ when it comes daylight . STO
* Take the pistol . STO
* You might need it . STO
* We'll still have the rifle , and I might be able to round up some more . STO
* I'll _RARE_ the rest of these horses so they can't _RARE_ you '' . STO
* Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty _RARE_ on the back . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , `` I'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again '' . STO
* Then he was on his way at a _RARE_ . STO
* Mike ran down the line , _RARE_ picket _RARE_ with the bayonet . STO
* He lifted a screeching war _RARE_ . STO
* That touched off a total _RARE_ . STO
* He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there . STO
* These poured through the gate and joined the flight . STO
* The animals _RARE_ away into the moonlight , heading for the _RARE_ . STO
* The guerrillas were _RARE_ from their _RARE_ at the west end of the _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Mike yelled . STO
* `` They're _RARE_ the stock '' ! STO
* He _RARE_ in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings . STO
* He crouched there . STO
* His shout had been taken up and repeated . STO
* The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the _RARE_ horses . STO
* All were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were _RARE_ or hardly _RARE_ at all . STO
* _RARE_ and Calhoun came running from the post . STO
* They had _RARE_ in their hands . STO
* They _RARE_ questions that were not answered in the _RARE_ . STO
* They followed the others toward the east gate . STO
* Beyond the stockade rifles began to _RARE_ as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were _RARE_ . STO
* Mike made a _RARE_ to the rear of the frame buildings . STO
* He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner . STO
* The area was deserted . STO
* A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade . STO
* Mike crawled to the door and peered in . STO
* The orderly room seemed to be deserted . STO
* A lantern hung from a _RARE_ , giving light . STO
* _RARE_ inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner . STO
* A brace of _RARE_ , _RARE_ on belts , hung from a _RARE_ , along with ammunition _RARE_ . STO
* An ammunition case stood open , containing _RARE_ which contained powder _RARE_ . STO
* Mike seized a blanket from a _RARE_ in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the load he peered from the door . STO
* His _RARE_ of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the _RARE_ was still clear of guerrillas . STO
* He looked at the looming _RARE_ of the supply wagons , struck by a new _RARE_ . STO
* He set his bundle down . STO
* _RARE_ the lantern from its _RARE_ , he shattered its _RARE_ with a blow against a post . STO
* He picked up the powder _RARE_ and ran out . STO
* _RARE_ paper _RARE_ , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the _RARE_ upon it . STO
* He _RARE_ the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open _RARE_ beneath the wagon . STO
* He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house . STO
* _RARE_ flame _RARE_ beneath the wagon . STO
* The stockade was _RARE_ lighted and the guerrillas _RARE_ him . STO
* They realized the truth . STO
* _RARE_ began to snap past him . STO
* One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that _RARE_ from the shoulder pack . STO
* Its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again . STO
* A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety . STO
* Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down . STO
* _RARE_ were racing toward him . STO
* Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them . STO
* The three of them _RARE_ through the door into the interior and fell in a heap . STO
* Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door . STO
* She crouched aside as bullets beat at the _RARE_ , chewing into the _RARE_ . STO
* Some tore entirely through the _RARE_ post oak . STO
* The iron _RARE_ held , but the _RARE_ were in danger of being torn from the _RARE_ . STO
* Mike rolled to Susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet . STO
* He _RARE_ over her to shield her , for spent bullets were _RARE_ against the rear walls . STO
* He peered from a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ were only a dozen yards away , charging the house . STO
* Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered _RARE_ and fired . STO
* He dropped a man with the first bullet . STO
* At the same moment _RARE_ Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another _RARE_ was hit . STO
* That halted the rush . STO
* The guerrillas scattered for cover . STO
* The wagons were burning _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ had caught fire also . STO
* The _RARE_ was spreading to the frame buildings . STO
* The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* One screeched . STO
* `` There goes our _RARE_ an' ammunition '' ! STO
* `` Get a bucket line going '' ! STO
* Calhoun shouted . STO
* `` _RARE_ ! STO
* _RARE_ '' ! STO
* The guerrillas began a frantic search for _RARE_ in which to bring water from the spring . STO
* But what few _RARE_ they found were inadequate . STO
* Many of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a _RARE_ effort . STO
* Both buildings were in flames . STO
* The heat drove the guerrillas back . STO
* The roof of the command post began to _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ the wagons to the spring '' ! STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ yelled . STO
* `` Run 'em right into the spring ! STO
* _RARE_ '' ! STO
* One of the wagons _RARE_ a massive _RARE_ of flame . STO
* A _RARE_ supply of powder had been touched off . STO
* The wagons and the _RARE_ were beyond saving and so were the buildings . STO
* The glow of the fire reached through the _RARE_ in the windows , giving light enough to examine Mike's wound . STO
* The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee , _RARE_ an ugly _RARE_ that was forming a pool of blood on the floor . STO
* But it had missed the bone and had passed on through . STO
* Susan and Julia _RARE_ strips from their clothing and bound the injury . STO
* Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to _RARE_ around on it . STO
* `` So it wasn't the _RARE_ that made him return to his village '' ! STO
* `` No . STO
* Now _RARE_ , I don't want to go into any more explanations . STO
* Here comes _RARE_ . STO
* Keep this to yourself '' . STO
* Reverend _RARE_ , looking worried , hurried toward us . STO
* `` Anything wrong , _RARE_ ? STO
* The men seem to think so '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ found a large war party south of us . STO
* They'll probably attack at dawn '' , Montero said . STO
* He brushed past the _RARE_ and walked into the center of the camp . STO
* _RARE_ his hands as a _RARE_ he shouted , `` Fort up ! STO
* Fort up ! STO
* There's a large war party on their way '' ! STO
* For a second , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ appeared struck dumb . STO
* Then Little Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water _RARE_ and for the _RARE_ to hurry up with the meal . STO
* They all flew into action . STO
* `` That was a terrible thing to do '' , I said to Oso . STO
* The Aricaras treated us like friends . STO
* And here all the time you knew the _RARE_ would be using our rifles on them ! STO
* God , what a world you people live in '' . STO
* Oso gave me an _RARE_ look . STO
* `` Old _RARE_ got the largest war party ever seen on the river '' , he said calmly . STO
* `` What would you have done in Montero's _RARE_ ? STO
* Let Old _RARE_ come up and kill you and your people , or would you _RARE_ him on someone else '' ? STO
* He shook his head . STO
* `` Mr. Manuel did that in the war . STO
* That's why the British never got the _RARE_ to fight for the King . STO
* Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the _RARE_ that the _RARE_ were _RARE_ to _RARE_ 'em for their horses . STO
* Then he went on to the _RARE_ and told them that the _RARE_ was goin' to move up . STO
* He did that with all the Nations . STO
* Hell , they were _RARE_ each other so hard they had no time for anyone else . STO
* The War Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero . STO
* I saw that letter . STO
* He carried it in a little _RARE_ made of fish skin '' . STO
* `` But that was war '' , I said . STO
* `` There's no war on now '' . STO
* `` You're wrong , _RARE_ . STO
* In this country there's a war on every time the grass turns green . STO
* First it was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites . STO
* And it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land '' . STO
* I remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight . STO
* `` That's why this company's important . STO
* Once we get over the mountains others will come along . STO
* That's why the _RARE_ don't want us to make it . STO
* That bastard _RARE_ ! STO
* -- Old _RARE_ not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work ! STO
* Before we get through he'll have the _RARE_ _RARE_ for our hair and our goods . STO
* Well , _RARE_ ain't goin' to help -- let's _RARE_ up '' ! STO
* As I dug in behind one of the _RARE_ we were using as protection , I grudgingly found myself _RARE_ with _RARE_ logic , especially when I imagined what would have happened to _RARE_ if Old _RARE_ large party of screeching warriors had _RARE_ our company . STO
* For , unlike the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ , the Aricaras are not great _RARE_ , nor are they aggressive like the savage _RARE_ . STO
* More of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the _RARE_ . STO
* Still , I was _RARE_ with myself for _RARE_ with Montero's methods . STO
* _RARE_ , he had told the others what he had done . STO
* In the brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses , I indicated I was _RARE_ by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river . STO
* `` I think Montero did right '' , Amy said firmly . STO
* `` Let the _RARE_ kill each other . STO
* What do we care '' ? STO
* Reverend _RARE_ was _RARE_ bitter . STO
* `` It was a terrible thing to do . STO
* Those little children . STO
* '' But Oso replied calmly , `` _RARE_ ain't easy to _RARE_ out in this country , _RARE_ '' . STO
* 28 . STO
* _RARE_ Gray Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink _RARE_ _RARE_ together the hills and the sky . STO
* Our camp was in the center of a wide valley . STO
* Montero had set up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to _RARE_ of _RARE_ and brush . STO
* He had ordered the ponies brought inside the _RARE_ circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked _RARE_ the job of trying to keep them steady under fire . STO
* The pony herd was the one _RARE_ in our defense ; ; the _RARE_ undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors . STO
* The _RARE_ had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time , and on Montero's orders had _RARE_ enough bread to last the day . STO
* _RARE_ were filled , the herd fed and _RARE_ . STO
* The worst part had been the waiting ; ; although we didn't expect the attack before dawn , the long _RARE_ night , filled with the sounds of the _RARE_ insects , seemed endless . STO
* _RARE_ and hunting _RARE_ sounded like _RARE_ Indian _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of a restless pony made one's skin crawl . STO
* Oso slept _RARE_ , his rifle _RARE_ in his arms ; ; I didn't catch a wink . STO
* Every time I closed my eyes , I saw Gray Eyes _RARE_ at me with a knife . STO
* It was a relief when they finally came . STO
* They poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , _RARE_ their _RARE_ and filling the morning with their _RARE_ _RARE_ cry . STO
* `` Oso '' , Montero called `` I'll get Gray Eyes '' . STO
* `` That'll be a pleasure to see '' , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle . STO
* `` Hold your fire '' , Montero was shouting . STO
* `` Wait until my shot . STO
* I'll shoot the first man who doesn't '' . STO
* I could see them in my sights . STO
* They were about a mile off ; ; under me the ground _RARE_ slightly . STO
* At first they were only feathers and dark _RARE_ faces and bodies , _RARE_ over their _RARE_ heads . STO
* _RARE_ they emerged as men . STO
* Gray Eyes was in the lead . STO
* His face was split by a _RARE_ streak , his eyes were _RARE_ of white ; ; _RARE_ red and black medicine symbols covered his chest . STO
* He was naked except for a _RARE_ . STO
* Next to him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions . STO
* His mouth was open , his neck _RARE_ with the strain of his _RARE_ . STO
* I found his chest in my sights . STO
* It had a red circle . STO
* The circle came nearer and nearer . STO
* My God , how long is he going to wait , I thought . STO
* Montero's rifle cracked . STO
* At first I thought he had missed . STO
* Gray Eyes remained erect . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ was still above his head . STO
* As he started to _RARE_ over , another warrior swung him onto his horse . STO
* I squeezed the trigger . STO
* At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony . STO
* I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball . STO
* He started to run but _RARE_ shot caught him on the wing . STO
* He jerked once in the grass and lay still . STO
* `` If you're goin' to kill 'em -- ! STO
* _RARE_ 'em '' ! STO
* Oso _RARE_ . STO
* What else he said was lost in the _RARE_ of gunfire on all sides . STO
* The Aricaras broke under the _RARE_ fire , _RARE_ and retreated . STO
* `` _RARE_ up ! STO
* _RARE_ up ! STO
* They'll be back '' ! STO
* Montero was shouting . STO
* Far up the valley I could see the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war _RARE_ , _RARE_ , blankets and wounded and dead horses . STO
* The morning air was filled with the _RARE_ odor of _RARE_ blood , the _RARE_ _RARE_ of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder . STO
* A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a _RARE_ . STO
* A rifle cracked ; ; the square head fell over . STO
* One of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek . STO
* His legs _RARE_ furiously , his long black hair _RARE_ out behind him . STO
* There was a ragged _RARE_ . STO
* He was dead before he hit the ground . STO
* `` For Christ's sake , don't waste your powder on one of 'em '' ! STO
* Montero shouted furiously . STO
* `` Wait for the charge ! STO
* The charge , I tell you '' ! STO
* The sharp _RARE_ at the end of the valley were faint . STO
* They grew louder as the Indians charged again . STO
* I could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease , their mouths open , shouting their _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` Gray Eyes is back , , Montero said . STO
* The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat . STO
* I could see the blood running down his chest . STO
* He was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to _RARE_ . STO
* I forgot to aim . STO
* In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger . STO
* Montero's shot had caught him high in the chest ; ; there was no doubt he was dying . STO
* Again we waited for Montero . STO
* This time he delayed so long that some of the _RARE_ shouted frantically , but they held their fire . STO
* The horses were only several lengths away when he fired . STO
* The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse . STO
* Our rolling _RARE_ swept most of the other _RARE_ from their mounts . STO
* But a few reached our wall . STO
* I heard the _RARE_ of an _RARE_ and a _RARE_ face burst apart in a bloody spray . STO
* I saw Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone . STO
* A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight . STO
* Men screamed . STO
* Oso reached up , jerked the _RARE_ from the bale and snapped his neck . STO
* Other Indians were running at the ponies , _RARE_ and waving blankets . STO
* Reverend _RARE_ got one , the _RARE_ the others . STO
* I saw the _RARE_ _RARE_ for a moment by the _RARE_ body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position . STO
* The ponies were almost _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again . STO
* This time more of them _RARE_ the barrier . STO
* A small Indian dived at Montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt . STO
* It sounded like a man kicking a _RARE_ . STO
* Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to _RARE_ the _RARE_ . STO
* Although my shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me . STO
* I could smell _RARE_ , grease , and oil . STO
* His eyes were dark , fluid , _RARE_ , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in . STO
* _RARE_ over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil . STO
* Now under me I could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in streaks of paint . STO
* The Aricaras made one last desperate charge . STO
* It was _RARE_ to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , _RARE_ and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their _RARE_ by the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ efficient _RARE_ . STO
* Others , badly wounded , gripped hands in _RARE_ , knees in _RARE_ , held on as long as possible and then , weak from _RARE_ _RARE_ , slipped _RARE_ , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the _RARE_ hoofs . STO
* Some gracefully _RARE_ from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last _RARE_ charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts . STO
* None of them reached our walls again . STO
* The few _RARE_ grudgingly turned away . STO
* In the distance we could hear the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ of the death song . STO
* She was carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and _RARE_ from her wrist . STO
* `` I saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger . STO
* `` You could burn down this whole _RARE_ with a fire that size . STO
* It wouldn't matter to a fool like you . STO
* It would to me '' . STO
* `` All right '' , Wilson said quickly . STO
* `` The _RARE_ too big . STO
* And I appreciate the advice '' . STO
* He was losing patience again . STO
* An hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company . STO
* She had helped him change his mind . STO
* `` I'm not _RARE_ you '' , she said . STO
* `` I'm telling you . STO
* That _RARE_ too big . STO
* Let it burn down . STO
* And make sure it's out when you leave in the morning '' . STO
* He was taken _RARE_ . STO
* It took him a long time to _RARE_ himself . STO
* `` There's some mistake '' , he said finally . STO
* `` You're right about the fire . STO
* It's bigger than it has to be , though I don't see where it's doing any harm . STO
* But you're wrong about the rest of it . STO
* I'm not leaving in the morning . STO
* Why should I ? STO
* I own the place '' . STO
* She showed her surprise by _RARE_ the reins and moving the _RARE_ around so that she could get a better look at his face . STO
* It didn't seem to tell her anything . STO
* She glanced around the clearing , taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and _RARE_ scattered over the ground , the two kids , the _RARE_ bull that was chewing its _RARE_ just within the far reaches of the _RARE_ . STO
* She studied it for a long time . STO
* Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled , and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it . STO
* `` You own this place '' ? STO
* She said , and her tone had _RARE_ until it was almost friendly . STO
* `` You bought it '' ? STO
* `` From a man in St. Louis '' , Wilson said . STO
* `` Jake _RARE_ . STO
* Maybe you know him '' . STO
* The girl laughed . STO
* `` I know him . STO
* I ought to . STO
* My father ran him off here six years ago '' . STO
* Wilson didn't say anything . STO
* He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next . STO
* She had picked up the quirt and was _RARE_ it around her wrist and smiling at him . STO
* `` _RARE_ didn't tell you that '' , she said . STO
* `` No '' , Wilson said . STO
* `` But it's understandable . STO
* It's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of . STO
* And it doesn't make any difference . STO
* He sold me a clear title . STO
* I have it with me , right here . STO
* If you want to see '' -- `` Never mind '' , she said _RARE_ . STO
* `` It wouldn't matter to my father , and not to me . STO
* I meant what I said about that fire . STO
* Be sure it's out when you leave . STO
* That's all . STO
* I'll let you go back to doing the dishes now '' . STO
* It was meant to _RARE_ him , and didn't quite succeed . STO
* He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now . STO
* `` I don't mind washing dishes now and then '' , he said pleasantly . STO
* `` It doesn't hurt . STO
* It might hurt you , though . STO
* Somebody might mistake you for a woman '' . STO
* He meant to say more , but he never got the chance . STO
* She was quick . STO
* She brought the quirt down , _RARE_ it across his cheek , and he tried to step back . STO
* She swung the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle . STO
* She came down against him , and he tried to break her fall . STO
* He grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him . STO
* It made him a little sick , and he let go of her . STO
* He got up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her . STO
* He wiped the blood from his cheek . STO
* `` I ought to '' -- he said . STO
* He was shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps . STO
* `` That quirt -- I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good . STO
* If you were a man '' -- `` She isn't , _RARE_ '' . STO
* The voice came from behind him , and Wilson turned . STO
* The fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees . STO
* But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him . STO
* He was tall and _RARE_ , a half-breed , Wilson thought . STO
* And he was handsome , despite the long thin scar that _RARE_ across his cheek . STO
* `` She's not a man , _RARE_ '' , he said . STO
* `` I am . STO
* If you've got any ideas '' . STO
* He raised the Winchester and pointed it at _RARE_ chest . STO
* `` Put the rifle down , Joseph '' , the girl said . STO
* She seemed _RARE_ . STO
* `` I thought I told you to stay home '' . STO
* The half-breed _RARE_ the Winchester down and rested it across his lap . STO
* The scar looked pure white in the _RARE_ ; ; his eyes were black and _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* `` You shouldn't be riding up here after dark , _RARE_ '' , he said quietly . STO
* `` I can take care of this . STO
* It's no job for you '' . STO
* The girl _RARE_ the quirt impatiently against her knee and _RARE_ at him . STO
* He took it without _RARE_ . STO
* `` I said go home , Joseph . STO
* You've got no business up here '' . STO
* The half-breed didn't answer this time . STO
* But the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry . STO
* It made Wilson wonder . STO
* He watched the half-breed as he turned silently . STO
* They could hear the _RARE_ feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out . STO
* Wilson brushed the dust from his coat . STO
* `` Who was that '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` Your personal guard ? STO
* You're pretty hard on him '' . STO
* `` He works for my father '' , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind . STO
* `` He's a friend . STO
* His _RARE_ Joseph _RARE_ . STO
* Is there anything else you want to know '' ? STO
* `` Not now '' , Wilson said . STO
* `` I guess I'll find out soon enough . STO
* You've got blood on your cheek . STO
* Not yours . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* It must have got there when you fell against me '' . STO
* She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat . STO
* `` I'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said . STO
* He saw her hand start to work down the leather _RARE_ toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist . STO
* `` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now . STO
* `` I've had enough of that . STO
* I've had enough of you . STO
* I don't know what goes on around here , and I don't care . STO
* I don't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business , and I don't care about that , either . STO
* You took me by surprise . STO
* But I'll know how to handle you next time '' . STO
* She brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker . STO
* He _RARE_ her blow and she fell , stumbling against the _RARE_ . STO
* She finally _RARE_ her balance and got up in the saddle . STO
* Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before . STO
* He had forgotten that she was so pretty . STO
* But her _RARE_ was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* He had known women like that , one woman in particular . STO
* And one had been too many . STO
* He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping . STO
* They weren't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending . STO
* He hadn't shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be _RARE_ by a woman . STO
* They expected greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed . STO
* And determined not to show it . STO
* They lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed . STO
* `` Go to sleep '' , he said . STO
* `` Both of you . STO
* There's better things to do than listen to something like that . STO
* I'll be down at the creek _RARE_ the dishes , if you want me '' . STO
* He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream . STO
* The _RARE_ was calling again , and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to _RARE_ it . STO
* Not tonight , at any rate . STO
* He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble . STO
* If she did , he could stand it better in the light . STO
* He _RARE_ _RARE_ at the _RARE_ and reflected on how things had turned out . STO
* That afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the _RARE_ ranch house , his hopes had been high . STO
* Already some of the pain had gone from _RARE_ death . STO
* Not all of it . STO
* There would still be plenty of moments of regret and _RARE_ and guilty relief . STO
* But they were starting a new life . STO
* And they had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two _RARE_ _RARE_ , three horses . STO
* The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it . STO
* Six hundred and forty acres , the old man back in St. Louis had said ; ; good grass , good water . STO
* Well , the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it . STO
* The water was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead _RARE_ . STO
* And there was a house ; ; _RARE_ perhaps , but badly in need of repairs . STO
* In the last analysis , though , Wilson had little cause to complain . STO
* The place had been cheap -- just the little he had left after _RARE_ burial -- and it would serve its purpose . STO
* There was only one place where Jake _RARE_ description had gone badly _RARE_ : the peace and quiet . STO
* It hadn't started out that way . STO
* And he had a feeling -- thanks to the girl -- that things would get worse before they got better . STO
* 2 They had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses . STO
* He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him . STO
* _RARE_ was already in the wagon . STO
* They were going to town , and they were both excited . STO
* Wilson backed the team into the _RARE_ , and wished they weren't going to town at all . STO
* He had an uneasy feeling about it . STO
* That girl last night , what was her name ? STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember . STO
* He finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him . STO
* He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less _RARE_ than _RARE_ _RARE_ had made it seem . STO
* There was brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to _RARE_ . STO
* But there was water . STO
* There was an artificial _RARE_ just out of sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen _RARE_ that _RARE_ out of the ground above the hillside _RARE_ . STO
* Yes , there was plenty of water , too much , and that was probably the trouble . STO
* There were _RARE_ of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres . STO
* The first part of the road was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley . STO
* It was hotter once they reached the flat , and _RARE_ , but the grass was better . STO
* A warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves . STO
* A _RARE_ hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or _RARE_ that they might _RARE_ up from the side of the road . STO
* It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of _RARE_ . STO
* The town was about what Wilson expected : one main street with its rows of _RARE_ buildings , a water tower , a few _RARE_ , a single hotel ; ; all dusty and _RARE_ . STO
* The place was quiet . STO
* Such was my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this ; ; under the circumstances I was only too willing to _RARE_ all . STO
* I was nearly thirty at the time . STO
* I went to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters . STO
* It was dark and , I sensed , very large ; ; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long _RARE_ tube suspended directly above it . STO
* Sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the darkness . STO
* I would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite succeeded . STO
* A glimpse of three of four vague figures , at the most . STO
* _RARE_ here and there . STO
* _RARE_ , as if waiting . STO
* The _RARE_ glow of a cigarette . STO
* Since they could see me but I not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me . STO
* The clerk paid them no attention . STO
* This impressed me , until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence . STO
* His job simply consisted in _RARE_ new men . STO
* When the phone rang he answered it . STO
* His authority extended to the far edge of the counter , no further . STO
* None of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him . STO
* _RARE_ was _RARE_ his _RARE_ . STO
* He spoke to me in a _RARE_ voice , an _RARE_ which quite _RARE_ his personality . STO
* He wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of _RARE_ pale chest _RARE_ . STO
* It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was . STO
* But it was not easy for him and he often slipped . STO
* When one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the _RARE_ of _RARE_ I noticed how the clerk _RARE_ . STO
* I felt certain he was really a _RARE_ little man . STO
* His hat ( the cause of his _RARE_ ? STO
* ) hung on a _RARE_ on the wall , and _RARE_ it I could see his tie , _RARE_ , ready to be slipped over his head , a black _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ that ought never to have left his neck . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ were on the counter , and a stack of _RARE_ men's magazines . STO
* On a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio _RARE_ _RARE_ on a station which broadcast only _RARE_ commercials and cheap popular music . STO
* Everything about the clerk was trivial . STO
* Once , pressing him , I learned that his job was only _RARE_ , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall . STO
* _RARE_ my disappointment he attempted to _RARE_ what _RARE_ and shreds of authority he felt might still be _RARE_ to his person . STO
* With distaste I saw him assume a _RARE_ air . STO
* When he saw me coming he turned his radio off . STO
* He made a show of _RARE_ my forms on the shelf . STO
* He would pick up the ringing phone with studied _RARE_ , then bark into it with _RARE_ importance . STO
* What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me . STO
* In the mornings , I was informed , _RARE_ tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall . STO
* They , and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight _RARE_ through their _RARE_ , down at the far end of the hall , could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office . STO
* He pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I _RARE_ believed that he would let _RARE_ follow words . STO
* I was shown , instead , a _RARE_ of white tickets of the sort handed out , he told me , every morning . STO
* Now , here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand . STO
* He couldn't afford to have anyone mess around with them , he said . STO
* Each of those tickets was of great value to its _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I _RARE_ my hand . STO
* Later I would remember what this _RARE_ little man had told me about the worth of a ticket . STO
* Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , I gave myself over to _RARE_ concerning the hall itself . STO
* When _RARE_ lighted , what would it look like ? STO
* The presence of the two _RARE_ fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air . STO
* One afternoon , upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , I had visited the toilet _RARE_ the hall . STO
* By counting the number of _RARE_ and _RARE_ I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time . STO
* For although I had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended . STO
* I could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison . STO
* I had for some time been hoping , in _RARE_ , for one of the dim figures to pass between the _RARE_ _RARE_ and myself . STO
* I knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , I could not tell . STO
* It was , I felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners _RARE_ removed from the counter with its overhead light . STO
* This light did not _RARE_ very far back into the hall , and my eyes were _RARE_ rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the _RARE_ _RARE_ when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or _RARE_ , on the floor below . STO
* Also the clerk appeared to _RARE_ of my frequent curious _RARE_ back over my shoulder . STO
* No sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at times quite sharply , in order to bring back my attention . STO
* And I had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the _RARE_ occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off and on impatiently . STO
* This sort of _RARE_ _RARE_ annoyed me . STO
* I felt certain it was _RARE_ . STO
* It sprang from a type of _RARE_ I'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here . STO
* I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed . STO
* I felt strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance . STO
* I lived in a state of suspense because of it . STO
* I could not _RARE_ to my past nor did I wish to . STO
* I had signed it off on the forms . STO
* My future lay solely with the hall , yet what did I know about the hall at this point ? STO
* Although I had been inside it I had not yet seen it functioning . STO
* I wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to be wearing . STO
* I did not despair , however ; ; far from it ! STO
* I was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall . STO
* Though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to me . STO
* Large _RARE_ _RARE_ the street on which the hall _RARE_ . STO
* The river was only a few blocks away but an _RARE_ line of _RARE_ prevented me from seeing it . STO
* Sometimes I noticed the tops of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ reaching above the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The sounds _RARE_ from beyond -- _RARE_ _RARE_ , men shouting -- indicated great activity and excited me . STO
* The hall , on the other hand , appeared _RARE_ and deserted on these long _RARE_ afternoons . STO
* It resembled nothing I'd ever seen before . STO
* Its front was _RARE_ , but _RARE_ in the _RARE_ might be an indication that windows , now _RARE_ , had once looked out upon the street . STO
* I kept _RARE_ the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall . STO
* But it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it . STO
* For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of _RARE_ and garages , truck _RARE_ and taxi repair shops , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ lunch _RARE_ , yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there . STO
* I returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk . STO
* As I had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application . STO
* Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer . STO
* At last , when I put it to him directly , the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual . STO
* When I asked him what , if anything , I could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall . STO
* I could consult this _RARE_ on any _RARE_ morning , though not before ten o'clock . STO
* The clerk impressed this upon me : that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock . STO
* When I went for my interview with the director I saw why . STO
* Although it was dark as usual I could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ the floor . STO
* The big fans were going , drawing from the large room the _RARE_ of _RARE_ smoke which drifted about in pale _RARE_ _RARE_ the ceiling . STO
* I had felt the draft they were making while _RARE_ the stairs . STO
* The staircase itself seemed still to be _RARE_ the heavy _RARE_ of many men . STO
* I stopped by the counter . STO
* No one was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office I noticed , for the first time , a door which had been left partially open . STO
* _RARE_ it I could see part part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor . STO
* The _RARE_ office . STO
* I _RARE_ my knuckles on the counter . STO
* The director came to the door . STO
* I was at once disappointed , although just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained . STO
* He was a man in his late _RARE_ , with _RARE_ hair , of medium height ; ; he looked _RARE_ in a _RARE_ summer suit , brown silk tie and _RARE_ soft collar . STO
* He wore _RARE_ , _RARE_ shoes ; ; they somehow made me expect to see him _RARE_ into a vaudeville _RARE_ routine any moment . STO
* But he came toward me _RARE_ enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file _RARE_ and got out my application . STO
* I had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times . STO
* He did not look at them now . STO
* As he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered what this _RARE_ , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the _RARE_ of the hall . STO
* He spoke , in a voice as _RARE_ as his appearance . STO
* Why had I registered ? STO
* _RARE_ my pardon , he must express his _RARE_ over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall . STO
* He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ; indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college _RARE_ himself , must _RARE_ me them . STO
* Was I sure , he asked , that I knew what I was applying for ? STO
* What sort of men I would come into contact with , at the hall ? STO
* These questions did not surprise me ; ; I felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and _RARE_ place . STO
* Though I doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying . STO
* I had always , I said , _RARE_ after working hard with my hands . STO
* This desire , I went on , growing _RARE_ as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual _RARE_ . STO
* To this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence . STO
* The flat , hard cap was small , but he thrust it to the back of his head . STO
* `` _RARE_ him up '' . STO
* `` Hell with it '' . STO
* Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the _RARE_ own gun against the _RARE_ head , hard . STO
* The man went over without sound , falling to the bare floor . STO
* Barton said _RARE_ , `` Why did you do that '' ? STO
* Rankin _RARE_ at him . STO
* `` What did you want me to do , kiss him ? STO
* He dumped me in solitary twice '' . STO
* Barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around . STO
* `` Let's get one thing straight , you and me . STO
* The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out . STO
* If you ever try anything without my orders I'll kill you '' . STO
* Fred Rankin looked at him . STO
* It seemed to Barton that the green eyes _RARE_ him , the _RARE_ smile held _RARE_ , but he had no time to waste now . STO
* `` Come on . STO
* Let's move '' . STO
* They filed out through the _RARE_ door , into the _RARE_ square . STO
* There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to _RARE_ , but they were in other cell blocks . STO
* There was no chance . STO
* They moved slowly , toward the main gate , following the wall . STO
* There was no moon . STO
* They had chosen this night _RARE_ . STO
* They reached the guard house without _RARE_ the men on the walls above , and Powers slipped through the door . STO
* Two men were on duty inside , playing _RARE_ , relaxed . STO
* They looked up in surprise as Powers came in . STO
* `` What are you doing out of the block '' ? STO
* `` It's _RARE_ '' , he said , _RARE_ the man Rankin had hit . STO
* `` I've got to have help '' . STO
* They stared at him . STO
* The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet . STO
* `` What's wrong with him '' ? STO
* `` He's having some kind of a fit '' . STO
* The sergeant turned to the door . STO
* As he passed through it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side . STO
* `` One sound and you're dead '' . STO
* The sergeant froze . STO
* Powers had not followed . STO
* Powers was covering the remaining guard . STO
* The man _RARE_ for the cord of the alarm bell . STO
* Powers knocked his arm aside . STO
* _RARE_ , with none of _RARE_ _RARE_ , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the _RARE_ head . STO
* They were free . STO
* Even Barton could not quite believe it . STO
* It had gone without a _RARE_ . STO
* They slid through the _RARE_ in the big gate , _RARE_ across the dark ground . STO
* Five minutes later they reached the horses . STO
* Barton was relieved to see that Carl Dill and _RARE_ Foster had brought extra mounts . STO
* He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short . STO
* No one hurried . STO
* They walked the horses , heading along the river , Barton and _RARE_ Foster in the lead , seven men riding quietly through the night . STO
* The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of _RARE_ . STO
* Five miles . STO
* In a small grove against the river they halted , turning deep into the protection of the trees . STO
* Foster had brought extra clothing also . STO
* A good man , _RARE_ . STO
* He had been one of the original Night _RARE_ , one who had escaped the trial . STO
* It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on _RARE_ release from the prison . STO
* _RARE_ Miller was crying softly to himself , _RARE_ his striped suit and _RARE_ into the _RARE_ _RARE_ pants , the worn brown shirt . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ was unusually silent , Rankin _RARE_ , a few _RARE_ apart . STO
* Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers . STO
* `` I won't even try to thank you '' . STO
* The _RARE_ guard was embarrassed . STO
* He said in a studied voice , `` I didn't do it for you . STO
* I did it for the valley . STO
* You're the only man the Night _RARE_ will follow . STO
* We've been _RARE_ and I don't like to _RARE_ '' . STO
* Barton turned away , his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse . STO
* `` Good luck '' . STO
* The murderer lifted his head . STO
* `` _RARE_ you want me to ride out '' ? STO
* `` You aren't one of us . STO
* There's nothing for you here '' . STO
* `` I got no place to go '' . STO
* Barton hesitated . STO
* He did not trust Rankin , his violent _RARE_ , his killer _RARE_ . STO
* But ten years in prison had taught him _RARE_ . STO
* They were in a fight , _RARE_ in both numbers and money . STO
* It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them Night _RARE_ , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure . STO
* But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals , men who knew how to use a gun against men , who would match the _RARE_ on the other side . STO
* `` Your choice '' , he said briefly , and turned to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ those uniforms so they won't be found '' . STO
* Then Barton touched Carl _RARE_ arm and moved off , up the river bank . STO
* He wanted a careful , _RARE_ report from Dill on the conditions in the valley . STO
* They _RARE_ on their heels in the deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket , passing it over silently . STO
* He too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ Barton drew in the _RARE_ deeply , letting the smoke lie warm and _RARE_ in his throat for a moment before he _RARE_ . STO
* Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly . STO
* For his first five years in prison , they had shared a cell . STO
* Carl Dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man . STO
* He had been the _RARE_ for the mining _RARE_ , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the _RARE_ money . STO
* He had done time for the theft . STO
* The one thing they had in common was their hatred . STO
* Both hated Donald Kruger . STO
* It had drawn them together , and since his release from prison Dill had worked _RARE_ to effect this night's escape . STO
* He said now , `` I've got the perfect headquarters set up . STO
* The old _RARE_ mine '' . STO
* _RARE_ Barton knew the place . STO
* _RARE_ years before a group of _RARE_ had bought out the _RARE_ claims in the rocky hills south of _RARE_ Valley . STO
* They had spent a million dollars , _RARE_ in a road , putting up buildings , _RARE_ their _RARE_ tunnel . STO
* Then the vein had _RARE_ out and the whole project had been abandoned . STO
* `` The _RARE_ washed badly '' , said Dill , `` but there's a trail you can get over with a horse . STO
* A company of _RARE_ couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail '' . STO
* Barton nodded . STO
* `` How do the valley people feel '' ? STO
* `` As mad as ever . STO
* But _RARE_ men keep them off balance , and they don't trust me . STO
* I'm an _RARE_ . STO
* When they learn you're in the hills though , they'll _RARE_ , don't worry about that '' . STO
* Barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always _RARE_ in his mind . STO
* `` My boy . STO
* Did you find him '' ? STO
* Dill was silent as if he hated to answer , and Barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension . STO
* `` He's in _RARE_ Ferry '' . STO
* Barton _RARE_ in surprise . STO
* `` What's he doing there '' ? STO
* Again Dill hesitated . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* How come '' ? STO
* `` Your _RARE_ has the _RARE_ bank in Cap _RARE_ saloon '' . STO
* Barton cursed under his breath . STO
* After another long pause he asked , `` How many people know who they are '' ? STO
* `` Everyone . STO
* Your cousin _RARE_ saw to that . STO
* He's quite a _RARE_ , you know . STO
* He sold out to _RARE_ men . STO
* He's informed them of everything you've ever written him . STO
* He wants your ranch '' . STO
* Barton stood up . STO
* He said _RARE_ , `` All right . STO
* Let's go get the boy '' . STO
* Dill had come up also . STO
* `` I was afraid of this . STO
* I almost didn't tell you '' . STO
* `` If you hadn't I'd have killed you '' . STO
* _RARE_ voice tightened . STO
* `` But you can't ride into the Ferry . STO
* That's what they'll expect you to do . STO
* They'll be there waiting for you . STO
* I understand how you feel about the child . STO
* '' `` The hell you do '' . STO
* _RARE_ voice was _RARE_ than Dill had ever heard it . STO
* `` I never saw him . STO
* My wife died in _RARE_ after I was sent away . STO
* `` I can't leave him there . STO
* Donald Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as _RARE_ , and I wouldn't _RARE_ a snake to his tender care . STO
* I've got to get the boy . STO
* Let's ride '' . STO
* Chapter two _RARE_ men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places , carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult . STO
* It was over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state . STO
* It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in _RARE_ . STO
* It reached the mines at North San Juan and _RARE_ . STO
* It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences . STO
* For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder _RARE_ , and _RARE_ Barton the _RARE_ which could send it into _RARE_ violence . STO
* _RARE_ Hague sat in his office above the _RARE_ pit . STO
* The office was of _RARE_ , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove . STO
* The building was _RARE_ by the scene outside . STO
* There a dozen giant _RARE_ played their _RARE_ _RARE_ of water against the huge _RARE_ of _RARE_ gravel which was the _RARE_ . STO
* The gravel was the bed of an ancient river , _RARE_ in some _RARE_ _RARE_ of earth . STO
* It was partially _RARE_ by ages and pressure , yet it _RARE_ before the _RARE_ of the powerful streams , the force of a thousand fire _RARE_ , and with the gold it held washed down through the long _RARE_ . STO
* A million _RARE_ of gold a month . STO
* A million tons of rock and soil and brush . STO
* The _RARE_ ran _RARE_ hours each day . STO
* Their roar , like the swelling volume of a hundred _RARE_ could be heard for miles . STO
* Hague , like all who worked near the _RARE_ , was partly _RARE_ from the constant _RARE_ against his _RARE_ . STO
* He was a big man , wearing a neat _RARE_ shirt against the cold _RARE_ air . STO
* _RARE_ showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt . STO
* Ten years older than _RARE_ Barton , he had _RARE_ his way up from _RARE_ in the _RARE_ to manager of the operation . STO
* He was proud of his _RARE_ , proud of his job , proud that Donald Kruger and his _RARE_ trusted him . STO
* He lived and breathed for the mining company . STO
* No man could have reached his spot nor held it without being _RARE_ , and Hague had made a virtue of _RARE_ all of his life . STO
* There came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room . STO
* Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke . STO
* The man was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a _RARE_ nose . STO
* The eyes always held Hague , eyes of a dead man , _RARE_ as a _RARE_ , with the fixed intensity of a _RARE_ . STO
* Even Hague was _RARE_ by the _RARE_ _RARE_ that was Kodyke . STO
* He knew nothing about the man's history . STO
* Kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger . STO
* Kodyke was to head the _RARE_ company police . STO
* He ran the change rooms . STO
* He threw out the _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ the _RARE_ and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco . STO
* Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike . STO
* He pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a _RARE_ . STO
* `` This is _RARE_ Barton . STO
* He broke out of _RARE_ last night . STO
* Apparently he _RARE_ one of the guards . STO
* We want him back there or we want him dead '' . STO
* Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ , yes . STO
* You know how the ranchers in the valley are . STO
* They blame us for all their troubles . STO
* Ten years ago they blew up some of our _RARE_ . STO
* It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them . STO
* We don't want _RARE_ Night _RARE_ loose again '' . STO
* The _RARE_ nodded , _RARE_ the picture into his breast pocket , saying nothing . STO
* _RARE_ Hague wasted no words , but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said . STO
* If she sensed any unusual _RARE_ on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it . STO
* After they had finished eating , _RARE_ took _RARE_ the _RARE_ under her arm -- `` so that _RARE_ _RARE_ can teach it about the _RARE_ '' -- and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother . STO
* She had offered to walk , but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally _RARE_ her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* When they reached their _RARE_ house , Pamela said a few _RARE_ words to _RARE_ and kissed _RARE_ lightly on the forehead , the impulse _RARE_ by a stray thought -- of the type to which she was frequently subject these days -- that they might never see one another again . STO
* Then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill , with the village as her _RARE_ destination . STO
* As she drove , she thought about her plan . STO
* It was really quite simple . STO
* So simple , in fact , that it might even work -- although Pamela , now , in her new frame of mind , was careful not to pretend too much assurance . STO
* That mistake , she thought , had cost her _RARE_ these past few days , and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her . STO
* She must be _RARE_ so as not to alert the _RARE_ forest . STO
* When the station wagon drew _RARE_ of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the _RARE_ house , Pamela turned the wheel , guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house , and stopped . STO
* All of her movements were careful and _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of a criminal who has plotted his _RARE_ for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime . STO
* She locked the _RARE_ , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house . STO
* Here , she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom . STO
* On her bureau lay a small , brass _RARE_ of simple design and faded _RARE_ -- an object which , Pamela believed now , had been the property of her _RARE_ , Major _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He had belonged to this land and , perhaps , had _RARE_ it -- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him . STO
* If she , Pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of _RARE_ . STO
* She would return this symbol to the mountain , as one _RARE_ seed back into the soil every Spring or as ancient fertility _RARE_ demand annual human sacrifice . STO
* Slowly and thoughtfully , she slipped the _RARE_ into the pocket of her slacks , moved down the stairs and out of the house . STO
* There was only one place where the mountain might receive her -- that _RARE_ , _RARE_ pool _RARE_ in its secret bosom . STO
* _RARE_ , if _RARE_ were possible , could only be made at that sacred , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It was there that she would have to enact her _RARE_ , beg _RARE_ . STO
* Perhaps it was insane , Pamela thought . STO
* Perhaps it was all a _RARE_ conceived dream . STO
* But she was caught in it , and she faced the terrible possibility that , if it were a dream , it was one from which she might never awaken . STO
* _RARE_ the forest now , she who had not dared to enter it before , walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool . STO
* She remembered little of her previous journey there with _RARE_ , and she could but hope that her _RARE_ to her mission would enable her to accomplish it . STO
* The forest was open and freely _RARE_ , extending an _RARE_ hand . STO
* The ground was covered with soft pine _RARE_ and the slope was gentle . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the trees and the sun , all _RARE_ and soft , _RARE_ her shoulders _RARE_ from time to time . STO
* It was not , thought Pamela , such an evil place after all . STO
* No wonder _RARE_ responded so completely to its _RARE_ . STO
* Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their _RARE_ above her head as she passed . STO
* Was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in _RARE_ with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the _RARE_ that she had _RARE_ in failing to understand this ? STO
* Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along . STO
* The slight _RARE_ that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim _RARE_ of trees through which she occasionally passed did not _RARE_ her fear . STO
* She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the _RARE_ she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her _RARE_ , _RARE_ struggle with the mountain and its _RARE_ inhabitants . STO
* Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , Pamela was relieved now to admit their _RARE_ and to be taking definite steps toward _RARE_ with them . STO
* A few days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; ; today , on the contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable . STO
* She did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; ; she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal . STO
* If , as she walked , her steps fumbled from time to time , she chose to ignore that _RARE_ . STO
* If the slope grew _RARE_ and the _RARE_ more dim , she tried not to _RARE_ . STO
* Success _RARE_ upon maintaining her _RARE_ ; ; she must be poised and proud and _RARE_ in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest . STO
* The forest took on an _RARE_ aspect . STO
* It did not care what sort of person _RARE_ its woods , _RARE_ at its bark or stripped the _RARE_ from its bushes . STO
* _RARE_ , indifferent , _RARE_ , the forest was simply there -- fighting man's _RARE_ with more _RARE_ growth and man's _RARE_ with its own musical evening laughter . STO
* Red man or white man , _RARE_ or killer , the forest would accept them all -- knowing that it could _RARE_ equally well on _RARE_ and _RARE_ ; ; knowing that its _RARE_ mass would always _RARE_ the short span of time allotted to any man . STO
* Pamela shook her head . STO
* She must not think about time . STO
* That was another one of those traps . STO
* In her grim pursuit of _RARE_ , Pamela focused her thoughts on her husband . STO
* If , when this was all over , she found the words to tell him about it , she wondered if he would ever understand . STO
* How could he _RARE_ her need when he himself was innocent ? STO
* Indian _RARE_ would not _RARE_ upon his nights , nor would his days be haunted by the _RARE_ , _RARE_ figure of her _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* His bright , daylight mind would _RARE_ away such images ; ; they would not dare to face his _RARE_ . STO
* Pamela was glad Jim was nowhere near . STO
* His presence would have _RARE_ with her duty . STO
* The _RARE_ grew _RARE_ and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine _RARE_ . STO
* The trees huddled more closely together , their _RARE_ and leaves _RARE_ in a _RARE_ curtain against the sun . STO
* _RARE_ and vines _RARE_ the rocks in forming _RARE_ _RARE_ for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act as _RARE_ , Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction . STO
* Nevertheless , she continued to move upward . STO
* She was sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of _RARE_ . STO
* The forest had become an alien world where she _RARE_ , alone , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , to deal with whatever _RARE_ were offered . STO
* It was a bold , dark _RARE_ of pine _RARE_ that stood like a medieval _RARE_ , _RARE_ the sun and human time . STO
* At one and the same time , she was within it but still searching for the _RARE_ that would give her entry . STO
* _RARE_ came into the forest -- a solid being that _RARE_ its hand over the _RARE_ mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees . STO
* _RARE_ walked at _RARE_ side , its presence _RARE_ close , yet too far for her to hear . STO
* _RARE_ stood in front of her , waiting , and in back of her , _RARE_ her retreat . STO
* She stumbled over the root of a tree that _RARE_ _RARE_ above the earth . STO
* In spite of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fell , _RARE_ her arm on a naked stone . STO
* For a moment , she could not catch her breath and then , her breath returning in short , frightened _RARE_ , she lifted herself to her feet _RARE_ . STO
* She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes . STO
* Her arm _RARE_ slightly , and the _RARE_ skin cried out in pain . STO
* She looked around . STO
* She was bewildered . STO
* She seemed to have come such a long distance -- too far for her destination which had _RARE_ been swallowed up in the _RARE_ gloom of the trees . STO
* She stood quite still , trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her . STO
* She was standing in a thick grove . STO
* The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches _RARE_ , virtually _RARE_ out the sun completely . STO
* The earth smelled moist and _RARE_ as it might in a cave deprived of the _RARE_ effect of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* She had the feeling that , under the _RARE_ leaves , there would be the bodies of dead animals , quietly _RARE_ and giving their soil back to the mountain . STO
* The thought made Pamela _RARE_ . STO
* A terrible chill swept through the grove . STO
* Not a breeze exactly , but a pocket of icy air that settled with a _RARE_ familiarity upon the deep _RARE_ of the grove , _RARE_ Pamela in a _RARE_ embrace . STO
* There was a peculiar density about it , a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified , never actually perceived . STO
* Where before had she felt or _RARE_ or imagined such a scene ? STO
* She already knew this _RARE_ , _RARE_ atmosphere that was somehow _RARE_ alive . STO
* It enclosed her _RARE_ hands and _RARE_ around her _RARE_ . STO
* It crept into the open neck of her _RARE_ and slid down her body , _RARE_ into her flesh through all the quivering _RARE_ of her skin . STO
* It crawled across her breasts , _RARE_ the life in her _RARE_ . STO
* It circled her thighs , _RARE_ with its icy _RARE_ . STO
* It entered her body with the _RARE_ _RARE_ of an _RARE_ , and its particles , spreading , creeping , crawling , joined themselves into steel bands that _RARE_ her knees so tightly that they _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ her lungs so that her breath came in _RARE_ gasps ; ; clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were _RARE_ together in the rigid _RARE_ of her jaws . STO
* She had to get away from here before this _RARE_ possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , _RARE_ her of reason and sight . STO
* But she did not know which way to go . STO
* The shadows of the trees _RARE_ her , _RARE_ every possible exit from the grove . STO
* She had been _RARE_ here by a _RARE_ _RARE_ that _RARE_ around her throat in _RARE_ circles . STO
* She could not scream , for even if a sound could take shape within her _RARE_ mouth , who would hear , who would listen ? STO
* Does the mountain listen ? STO
* Pamela groped _RARE_ . STO
* She had to escape . STO
* She had to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place . STO
* She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to _RARE_ her back . STO
* Her own body protested , _RARE_ painfully where the blood in her veins had _RARE_ , where cold _RARE_ _RARE_ still clung and _RARE_ . STO
* Every movement she made seemed _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ cracked loudly under her feet ; ; bushes _RARE_ and scratched at her slacks ; ; tree branches snapped as she pushed them _RARE_ away from her . STO
* _RARE_ , she found exactly the right statement . STO
* She began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him . STO
* `` I want to tell you something Thomas _RARE_ Lord . STO
* I'm well aware that you've got a _RARE_ as long as my leg , and that I don't amount to anything . STO
* But '' -- `` But it don't matter _RARE_ '' , Lord supplied _RARE_ . STO
* `` To me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams , an' the _RARE_ flower that grows '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , he _RARE_ out his lips and attempted to kiss her . STO
* She yanked away from him furiously . STO
* `` You shut up ! STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ ! STO
* I've got something to say to you , and by God you're going to listen . STO
* Do you hear me ? STO
* You're going to listen '' ! STO
* Lord nodded _RARE_ . STO
* He said he wanted very much to listen . STO
* He knew that anything a _RARE_ little lady like her had to say would be plumb important , as well as _RARE_ to the ear , and he didn't want to miss a word of it . STO
* So would she mind speaking a little louder ? STO
* `` I think you _RARE_ , Tom Lord ! STO
* I think you're mean and _RARE_ and stupid , and -- louder '' ? STO
* Said Joyce . STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* So I can hear you while I'm _RARE_ the car . STO
* _RARE_ like we might be in for a _RARE_ of trouble '' . STO
* He opened the door and got out . STO
* He waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her _RARE_ . STO
* `` Well ? STO
* Wasn't you goin' to say _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Then , _RARE_ , as she merely stared at him in weary silence , `` Maybe you could write it down for me , _RARE_ ? STO
* _RARE_ it in real big letters , an' I can _RARE_ it out later '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , go on '' , she said . STO
* `` Just go the hell on '' . STO
* He grinned , nodded , and walked around to the front of the car . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , he stared down at its _RARE_ _RARE_ left side . STO
* Then he _RARE_ down on the heels of his _RARE_ boots , peered into the orderly _RARE_ of _RARE_ , shock _RARE_ , and spring . STO
* He went _RARE_ on his stomach , the better to pursue his examination . STO
* After a time , he straightened again , brushing the red _RARE_ dust from his hands , _RARE_ it from his _RARE_ _RARE_ and his _RARE_ , _RARE_ shirt . STO
* He wore no gun -- a strange _RARE_ for a peace officer in this country . STO
* Never , he'd once told Joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun . STO
* And he really feels that way , she thought . STO
* That's really all he's got , all he is . STO
* Just a big pile of _RARE_ in an almost _RARE_ package . STO
* If I could make myself feel the same way She studied him hopefully , _RARE_ ; ; against the _RARE_ background of sky and _RARE_ it was easy to confirm her analysis . STO
* Here in the _RARE_ place , the _RARE_ end of nowhere , Tom Lord looked almost _RARE_ , almost _RARE_ . STO
* He was handsome , with his _RARE_ hair and eyes , his _RARE_ features . STO
* But she'd known plenty of _RARE_ guys , and , _RARE_ his good looks , what was there left ? STO
* He wasn't a big man ; ; rather on the medium side . STO
* Neither was he very powerful of build . STO
* He could move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong . STO
* And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance . STO
* Just nothing , she told herself . STO
* Just so _RARE_ sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone . STO
* But , by _RARE_ , I want him and I'm going to have him ! STO
* He caught her eye , came back around the car with the _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ walk . STO
* Why did these _RARE_ still wear boots , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse in years ? STO
* He slid in at her side , _RARE_ a cigar into his mouth , and politely _RARE_ one to her . STO
* `` Oh , cut it out , Tom '' ! STO
* She snapped . STO
* `` Can't you stop that stupid _RARE_ for even a minute '' ? STO
* `` This ain't your brand , maybe '' , Lord suggested . STO
* `` Or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar '' ? STO
* `` I feel like getting back to town , that's what I feel like ! STO
* Now , are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ get there faster _RARE_ '' , Lord _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ as how I got a _RARE_ front spring . STO
* On the other hand , _RARE_ , maybe you wouldn't either . STO
* I _RARE_ it's _RARE_ a _RARE_ walk , and I _RARE_ maybe get this spring _RARE_ up in a couple of hours '' . STO
* `` How -- with what ? STO
* There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes '' . STO
* `` Now , ain't it the truth '' ? STO
* Lord laughed with secret _RARE_ . STO
* `` Not a _RARE_ thing but rattlesnakes , so I _RARE_ I'll get the boss _RARE_ to help me '' . STO
* `` Tom ! STO
* For God's sake '' ! STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* He pointed , cutting her off . STO
* `` See that _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She saw it then , the distant _RARE_ of the _RARE_ -- a test well in _RARE_ country . STO
* And even with her limited knowledge of such things , she knew that the car could be repaired there ; ; sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town . STO
* A _RARE_ had to be prepared for almost any emergency . STO
* He had to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others . STO
* `` Well , let's get going '' , she said impatiently . STO
* `` I '' -- She broke off , frowning . STO
* `` What did you mean by that _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* _RARE_ the boss _RARE_ to help you '' ? STO
* `` Why , I meant what I said '' , Lord declared . STO
* `` What else would I mean , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She looked at him , lips compressed . STO
* Then , with a _RARE_ of pretended indifference , she took a _RARE_ from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her _RARE_ . STO
* In his mood , it was the best way to handle him ; ; that is , to show no curiosity whatsoever . STO
* Otherwise , she would be _RARE_ into a _RARE_ -- _RARE_ and _RARE_ until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the _RARE_ struggle of Tom Lord _RARE_ Joyce _RARE_ . STO
* The car lurched along at a _RARE_ crawl , the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself . STO
* Lord whistled _RARE_ as he fought the steering wheel . STO
* He seemed very pleased with himself , as though some _RARE_ scheme was working out exactly as he had planned . STO
* _RARE_ with this _RARE_ , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension . STO
* It poured out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his _RARE_ body were _RARE_ for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated . STO
* Joyce had seen him like this once before -- more than once , actually , but on one particularly _RARE_ occasion . STO
* That was the day that he had practically _RARE_ up the main street of Big _RARE_ with _RARE_ McBride , field boss for the _RARE_ _RARE_ & _RARE_ Company . STO
* Tom had been laying for _RARE_ McBride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line . STO
* McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip . STO
* He had a _RARE_ reason for wearing it . STO
* It was _RARE_ for _RARE_ , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields . STO
* Moreover , as long as the weapon was carried openly , the _RARE_ office had made no previous issue of it . STO
* `` So what's this all about '' ? STO
* He demanded , when Lord confronted him . STO
* I'm not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit '' . STO
* It was the wrong thing to say . STO
* By failing to do as he was told instantly -- to take out a permit or return the gun to his car -- he had played into Lord's hands . STO
* The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest . STO
* The deputy had forced him to by his manner of _RARE_ him . STO
* So , `` How about it '' ? STO
* He said . STO
* `` Why single me out on this permit deal '' ? STO
* `` Well , I'll tell you about that '' , Lord told him . STO
* `` We aim _RARE_ be _RARE_ , _RARE_ ? STO
* Don't like to bother no one unless we have to , which I _RARE_ we do , in your case . STO
* _RARE_ we got to be plumb careful with any of you _RARE_ big shots '' . STO
* McBride _RARE_ . STO
* He himself had heard that there was _RARE_ money in the company , but that had nothing to do with him . STO
* He was an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable . STO
* `` Look , Lord '' , he said _RARE_ . STO
* `` I know you've got a _RARE_ against me , and maybe I can't blame you . STO
* You think that _RARE_ _RARE_ you and I helped 'em do it . STO
* But you're all wrong , man ! STO
* I'm no lawyer . STO
* I just do what I'm told , and '' -- `` _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ that could mean trouble with a _RARE_ that's _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* So you get rid of that pistol right now , _RARE_ McBride . STO
* You do that or take you out a permit right now '' . STO
* McBride couldn't do either , of course . STO
* Not immediately , as the deputy demanded . STO
* Not without a _RARE_ _RARE_ of at least a few minutes . STO
* To do so would make his job _RARE_ impossible . STO
* _RARE_ workers were a _RARE_ lot . STO
* How could he exert authority over them -- make them _RARE_ the line , as he had to -- if he _RARE_ under to this _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* `` I'll get around to it a little later '' , he mumbled desperately . STO
* `` Just as soon as I go to the bank , and '' -- `` _RARE_ . STO
* Now , _RARE_ McBride '' , said Lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field _RARE_ arm . STO
* It was strictly the _RARE_ game , but McBride had gone too far to throw in . STO
* Now , he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's _RARE_ deck . STO
* He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him , _RARE_ shoving him into a _RARE_ . STO
* It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own _RARE_ . STO
* Lord _RARE_ him in the stomach , so hard that the _RARE_ almost pressed against his _RARE_ . STO
* Then , as he _RARE_ , gasping , _RARE_ the breakfast he had so lately eaten , Lord straightened him with an _RARE_ . STO
* A rabbit _RARE_ _RARE_ him . STO
* And then there was a _RARE_ blow to the heart , and another _RARE_ blow to the stomach But he couldn't keep up with them . STO
* No more could he defend himself against them . STO
* He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen . STO
* And he could no longer think of _RARE_ , of honor , but only of escape . STO
* Why , he's going to kill me , he thought wildly . STO
* I meant him no harm . STO
* I've given _RARE_ hurt to no man . STO
* I was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he's going to kill me . STO
* _RARE_ me to death in front of a hundred people . STO
* Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go _RARE_ . STO
* He , McBride , would be _RARE_ as in the wrong , and he , Lord , would go _RARE_ , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too _RARE_ . STO
* McBride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the _RARE_ dust . STO
* _RARE_ , fleeing the _RARE_ shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again . STO
* He couldn't see ; ; he was long past the point of _RARE_ thinking . STO
* _RARE_ , he heard laughter , _RARE_ of _RARE_ , but he could not read the _RARE_ properly . STO
* He could not grasp that Lord had _RARE_ from the fight minutes ago , and that his _RARE_ arms were _RARE_ at nothing but the air . STO
* He hated them too much to understand -- the people of this isolated _RARE_ world that was Lord's world . STO
* This , he was sure , was the way they would act ; ; laughing at a dying man , laughing as a man was beaten to death . STO
* And nothing would be done about it . STO
* Nothing unless _RARE_ ! STO
* _RARE_ , his young wife , the girl who was both daughter and wife to him . STO
* _RARE_ was like he was . STO
* She lived by the rules , never _RARE_ , never _RARE_ or _RARE_ by circumstance . STO
* And _RARE_ would -- When he _RARE_ consciousness he was in Lord's house , in the office of _RARE_ Lord , the _RARE_ deceased father . STO
* The Brannon outfit -- known as the _RARE_ because of its brand -- reached _RARE_ _RARE_ before sundown . STO
* The herd was _RARE_ and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's _RARE_ . STO
* Two of the new hands , a Mexican named _RARE_ _RARE_ and a kid known only as _RARE_ , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd . STO
* The rest of the crew _RARE_ their mounts and turned them into the _RARE_ . STO
* They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the _RARE_ fire , rolled and lighted _RARE_ cigarettes , _RARE_ about . STO
* There was some idle talk , a _RARE_ discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive . STO
* But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the _RARE_ wife and son to join the outfit . STO
* It especially bothered the older hands . STO
* The cook , _RARE_ _RARE_ , had arrived there long before the herd . STO
* He'd started a fire and put coffee on , and now was busy at the work board of his _RARE_ wagon . STO
* He was _RARE_ a _RARE_ of _RARE_ biscuits for the Dutch _RARE_ . STO
* Supper would be ready within the hour . STO
* The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby . STO
* _RARE_ had _RARE_ the _RARE_ from both Tom _RARE_ and his father's wagon . STO
* Hank had gathered wood for a _RARE_ , and his wife was busy at it now . STO
* Conchita kept an eye on the _RARE_ and little _RARE_ , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing . STO
* Conchita _RARE_ at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon . STO
* Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the _RARE_ joined it , which had been at _RARE_ . STO
* He'd come alone , without his wife and child . STO
* He'd been in an angry mood : Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him . STO
* She wondered what had taken place in town , between him and his wife . STO
* She wished that she could talk to her mother about it . STO
* Not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it . STO
* But her mother would _RARE_ her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern . STO
* `` Pat , get out of that creek ! STO
* You too , _RARE_ ! STO
* _RARE_ , you'll get mud all over your dress '' ! STO
* Even as she called to the children , Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon . STO
* _RARE_ , she called him -- as the Mexican hands did . STO
* He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old _RARE_ , Luis Hernandez . STO
* Whatever they are talking about ? STO
* Conchita wondered . STO
* It bothered her that she probably would never know . STO
* Certainly , she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward . STO
* He would tell her not to _RARE_ into _RARE_ affairs -- as though she were a little kid like _RARE_ ! STO
* At the moment , the three men were not saying much of anything . STO
* They were sitting on their heels , _RARE_ , over by the still empty _RARE_ wagon . STO
* Brannon was _RARE_ down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him . STO
* He held a cigarette in his right hand . STO
* It was burning away , forgotten . STO
* His face was _RARE_ with unhappiness . STO
* He'd told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do . STO
* They were considering it _RARE_ , neither seeming to like what he planned . STO
* Finally Hernandez said , `` I could offer you advice , _RARE_ , but you wouldn't _RARE_ it '' . STO
* `` Let's hear it , anyway '' . STO
* `` Wait a little while . STO
* Let _RARE_ Brannon live in her father's house for a time . STO
* Give her time to miss you . STO
* Maybe she will then come to you . STO
* After all , you want the _RARE_ as much as you want the boy . STO
* You need her even more than you need him '' . STO
* `` She won't change her mind '' , Brannon said . STO
* `` John Clayton will see to that '' . STO
* `` But after a time away from you . STO
* '' `` A year , Luis ? STO
* Five ? STO
* Ten ? STO
* How long should I wait '' ? STO
* `` Maybe in a year , _RARE_ . STO
* '' `` In a year _RARE_ like living in _RARE_ house too much to come back to me '' , Brannon said _RARE_ . STO
* `` And the boy will be too much under his influence by then . STO
* I've got to take _RARE_ away from Clayton before I lose him altogether . STO
* Hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me -- his own father '' ! STO
* `` But to take him and leave his mother behind is not good '' . STO
* `` In my place , you'd follow such advice as you give me '' ? STO
* Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain . STO
* `` That I can't answer , for I can't imagine something like this happening to me . STO
* Maybe I should withdraw my advice -- no '' ? STO
* Brannon looked at Hank Maguire . STO
* `` And you ? STO
* What would you do in my place '' ? STO
* Hank shook his head . STO
* `` I don't know , Tom . STO
* Like Luis , I can't see something like this happening to me . STO
* With _RARE_ and me , there's never any problem . STO
* Where I go , she goes -- and the kids with us . STO
* You're going to need your woman . STO
* And the boy will need his mother . STO
* If you take the one , you'd better take both '' . STO
* Brannon shook his head . STO
* `` I won't force _RARE_ to come against her will . STO
* But I'm going to have my son '' . STO
* They were silent for a little while , each looking _RARE_ . STO
* Finally Luis Hernandez said , `` What must be , must be . STO
* I am with you , of course , _RARE_ '' . STO
* And Hank Maguire added , `` So am I , Tom '' . STO
* `` All right '' , Brannon said , rising . STO
* `` We'll ride out as soon as we've had _RARE_ '' . STO
* Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after _RARE_ . STO
* They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm . STO
* During much of the _RARE_ ride they had watched a _RARE_ display of lightning in the sky to the east . STO
* Later , they'd heard the _RARE_ of thunder and then , just outside _RARE_ , they ran into rain . STO
* Those who had _RARE_ _RARE_ them . STO
* The others put on old coats or _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ they carried behind their saddle _RARE_ . STO
* There were seven of them , enough for a show of strength -- to run a bluff . STO
* It was to be nothing more than that . STO
* There was to be no _RARE_ . STO
* If the bluff failed and they ran into trouble , Brannon had told the others , they would withdraw -- and he would come after his son another time . STO
* He didn't want to put himself outside the law . STO
* With him were Hank Maguire , Luis Hernandez , and _RARE_ son _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ brothers were also along . STO
* The seventh man was Red Hogan , a wiry little _RARE_ with a wild streak and a liking for _RARE_ . STO
* They were all good men . STO
* It was dark early , because of the storm . STO
* Also because of the storm , the streets of _RARE_ were deserted . STO
* _RARE_ windows glowed _RARE_ through the _RARE_ . STO
* They _RARE_ in before the town _RARE_ office , a _RARE_ building on Main Street . STO
* A lamp burned inside , but Brannon , peering through the window , saw that the office was empty . STO
* He'd hoped to catch _RARE_ Macklin there . STO
* `` Probably just stepped out '' , he said . STO
* `` Maybe to have supper . STO
* Red , come along . STO
* The rest of you wait here '' . STO
* With Red Hogan , he rode to the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside . STO
* `` Not there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse . STO
* `` Maybe he's at the hotel '' . STO
* They rode to the _RARE_ House , a little farther along the opposite side of the street . STO
* They _RARE_ in there , Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for _RARE_ Macklin in the hotel dining room . STO
* Brannon had no _RARE_ . STO
* He'd put on his old brown _RARE_ coat and it was already soaked . STO
* But he felt no physical _RARE_ . STO
* He was only vaguely aware of the _RARE_ rain . STO
* He hardly noticed the _RARE_ _RARE_ of lightning and the hard _RARE_ of thunder . STO
* Hogan _RARE_ , stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal . STO
* Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps . STO
* `` He's finished eating '' , Hogan said . STO
* `` _RARE_ with a cup of coffee now . STO
* It shouldn't be long '' . STO
* It seemed long , at least to Tom Brannon . STO
* He and Hogan waited by the door , one to either side . STO
* Macklin was the third man to come out , and he came _RARE_ . STO
* He was _RARE_ on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain . STO
* It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them , and then it was too late . STO
* They closed in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun . STO
* `` Just come along '' , Brannon told him . STO
* `` Don't start anything you can't finish '' . STO
* `` Now , listen '' -- Macklin began . STO
* `` We'll talk over at your office '' . STO
* `` Brannon , I _RARE_ you '' ! STO
* `` Let's go , Marshal '' , Brannon said , and took him by the arm . STO
* Hogan gripped the _RARE_ other arm . STO
* They _RARE_ him down from the porch and through the rain to his office . STO
* The other five _RARE_ men followed them inside , _RARE_ the small room . STO
* His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms . STO
* He looked at each of them in turn , Brannon last of all . STO
* `` I'll remember you '' , he said . STO
* `` Every last one of you . STO
* As for you , Brannon '' -- `` Put your gun on the desk , Marshal '' . STO
* `` Now , hold on , damn it ; ; I won't '' -- Red _RARE_ patience ran out . STO
* He lifted the skirt of _RARE_ coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk . STO
* `` Too much _RARE_ around '' , he said . STO
* `` Don't press your luck , _RARE_ '' . STO
* Brannon said , `` Now the key to the _RARE_ , Marshal '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Macklin said . STO
* `` What for '' ? STO
* `` Can't you guess '' ? STO
* Brannon said . STO
* `` We're putting you where you won't come to harm . STO
* Come on -- the key . STO
* Get it out '' ! STO
* `` _RARE_ if I will . STO
* Brannon , you've _RARE_ a law officer and '' -- They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides . STO
* No man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there . STO
* His face took on a sudden _RARE_ , became _RARE_ with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing . STO
* He held out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure . STO
* He swore , and said , `` All right . STO
* It's here in my pocket '' . STO
* `` Get it out '' , Brannon ordered . STO
* Then , as Macklin _RARE_ : `` Now let's go out back '' . STO
* _RARE_ , Macklin turned to the back door . STO
* They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear . STO
* The door of the _RARE_ was of oak _RARE_ and _RARE_ with _RARE_ iron . STO
* It was secured by an _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Macklin _RARE_ again , not wanting to _RARE_ and open the door . STO
* They crowded him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in . STO
* Once the door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building . STO
* He was _RARE_ threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and _RARE_ the door . STO
* They returned to the street , mounted their horses , rode through the rain to the big house on _RARE_ Street . STO
* Its windows glowed with _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ Marshal _RARE_ _RARE_ still stood guard on the veranda , a _RARE_ , _RARE_ figure in the _RARE_ dark . STO
* He came to the edge of the veranda , peered down at them with his hand on his gun . STO
* `` Don't try it '' , Brannon told him , _RARE_ and starting up the steps with his men following . STO
* `` Don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you '' . STO
* He strode past the now frightened man , entered the house . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ remained on the veranda to keep _RARE_ from _RARE_ . STO
* The others followed Brannon inside . STO
* They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly _RARE_ and _RARE_ men who probably had never before _RARE_ into such a house . STO
* They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of _RARE_ smoke , of horses and cattle . STO
* They _RARE_ mud on the _RARE_ floor , on the carpet . STO
* Their presence _RARE_ the _RARE_ of that room . STO
* And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles _RARE_ off guard . STO
* The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be _RARE_ . STO
* For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second . STO
* But the day of the _RARE_ came and passed , and the men who had _RARE_ at the _RARE_ laughed with satisfaction . STO
* For , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them . STO
* The exception was an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ named William Lewis . STO
* After walking out to his _RARE_ that morning , he'd been amazed to see the dust _RARE_ up in front of his feet . STO
* A split second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded . STO
* He'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the shot had come . STO
* But he had found all of the _RARE_ and points of cover deserted . STO
* There had been no sign of a _RARE_ and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near . STO
* Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing . STO
* He hadn't even pretended to be _RARE_ his spread . STO
* His land had never been plowed . STO
* He had done his rustling openly and _RARE_ about it . STO
* He had received both first and second anonymous notices , and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them . STO
* He had cursed at them and threatened them . STO
* He was a man , those neighbors _RARE_ later , who didn't have a friend in the world . STO
* William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone . STO
* `` I'll be ready next time '' ! STO
* He raged . STO
* `` I'll be _RARE_ right back '' . STO
* He had his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happened again . STO
* This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious _RARE_ shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area . STO
* He found nothing , but he still refused to give up and move out . STO
* `` Just let me meet up with that damned _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He _RARE_ . STO
* `` That's all I ask '' ! STO
* He never got that chance . STO
* For the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ aimed a little higher the third time . STO
* A bullet smashed directly into the center of William _RARE_ chest . STO
* He slumped against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself . STO
* Two more shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground . STO
* An _RARE_ was held , and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county _RARE_ estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards . STO
* _RARE_ of the offer Tom Horn had made at the _RARE_ Association meeting had _RARE_ out by then , and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got _RARE_ , the _RARE_ attorney , a Colonel _RARE_ , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning . STO
* It took some time to locate Horn . STO
* He was finally found in the _RARE_ _RARE_ region of _RARE_ County , two counties away . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an _RARE_ . STO
* But that _RARE_ was never made . STO
* For Tom Horn , it turned out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in _RARE_ _RARE_ the day of the killing . STO
* The former _RARE_ alibi couldn't be shaken . STO
* The authorities had to release him . STO
* He immediately rode on to _RARE_ , threw a _RARE_ drinking _RARE_ and dropped some very strong _RARE_ among friends . STO
* `` Dead center at three hundred yards , that _RARE_ said '' ! STO
* He'd grin . STO
* `` Three shots in that _RARE_ _RARE_ he hit the ground ! STO
* You _RARE_ there's two men in this state can shoot like that '' ? STO
* _RARE_ , he denied everything . STO
* _RARE_ , he created and _RARE_ an image of himself as a hired assassin . STO
* For a _RARE_ ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do . STO
* Tom Horn was soon back at work , giving his secret _RARE_ their _RARE_ worth . STO
* A good many _RARE_ _RARE_ were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats . STO
* The company _RARE_ were being _RARE_ less often , and _RARE_ and _RARE_ all over the range were standing deserted . STO
* But there were other _RARE_ who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal _RARE_ killing , the work of one of his neighbors . STO
* The rustling problem was by no means solved . STO
* Even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still _RARE_ . STO
* For less than a dozen miles from the _RARE_ land of the dead man lived another _RARE_ who had ignored the _RARE_ that his existence might be _RARE_ on -- a _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ named Fred Powell . STO
* `` Fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle '' his own hired man , Andy Ross , mentioned later . STO
* `` Everyone knew it , but he sort of acted like he didn't care who knew it -- even after them notes came , even after he'd heard about Lewis , even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times _RARE_ '' ! STO
* On the morning of September 10 , 1895 , Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day's work . STO
* _RARE_ time was close at hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack . STO
* _RARE_ a team to a _RARE_ , they drove out to a _RARE_ creek about a _RARE_ off , then climbed down and began _RARE_ . STO
* Andy Ross had just started swinging an _RARE_ at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded . STO
* He looked around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest . STO
* The hired man ran over to help his boss . STO
* `` My God , I'm shot '' ! STO
* Powell gasped . STO
* And he collapsed and died instantly . STO
* Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin . STO
* He _RARE_ the dead man onto the _RARE_ , yelled and _RARE_ at the team and got out of there fast . STO
* But he brought back the sheriff and several _RARE_ , and to the _RARE_ the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing . STO
* A detailed _RARE_ of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a _RARE_ of rocks that might have been the _RARE_ hiding place . STO
* There were no _RARE_ of either hoofs or boots . STO
* Not even an empty _RARE_ case could be found . STO
* Once again , Tom Horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought in for questioning immediately . STO
* Once again , he shook his head , kept his face _RARE_ and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready . STO
* Later , riding in for some _RARE_ _RARE_ of the liquor and professional ladies of _RARE_ , he laid claim to the killing with the vague _RARE_ he made . STO
* `` _RARE_ cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he'd _RARE_ announce . STO
* `` And I sort o' got a corner on the market '' . STO
* `` Tom '' , a friend asked him once , `` how come you _RARE_ them _RARE_ ? STO
* They wouldn't o' stood no chance with you in a plain , _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* He had lots of friends , then as always . STO
* Even as he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend . STO
* No man's name brought more _RARE_ when it was announced in a _RARE_ . STO
* `` Well '' , he explained , `` _RARE_ you was a _RARE_ _RARE_ the long rope ? STO
* Which would you be most _RARE_ of -- a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Yeah , I can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree . STO
* `` But well , it just don't seem _RARE_ somehow '' ! STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* The tall _RARE_ _RARE_ stared in amazement . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He echoed again in soft wonder . STO
* `` I seen a lot o' things in my time . STO
* I found a _RARE_ once the _RARE_ had _RARE_ on an _RARE_ hill , and another time we ran across some _RARE_ they'd caught , tied _RARE_ down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was _RARE_ right out o' their _RARE_ . STO
* I heard o' _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ a cow thief up in green _RARE_ and _RARE_ the sun _RARE_ 'em and _RARE_ him to death . STO
* But there's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just don't think there is , and that's a _RARE_ way o' _RARE_ a man '' ! STO
* After the first two _RARE_ , the warning notes were rarely ignored . STO
* The lesson had been learned . STO
* The examples were plain . STO
* When Fred _RARE_ _RARE_ , Charlie _RARE_ , moved into the dead man's home , the anonymous letter writer took no chances on Charlie taking up where Fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice : If you don't leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as _RARE_ was . STO
* This was the message found _RARE_ to the cabin door . STO
* _RARE_ left , within three days . STO
* All through Albany and _RARE_ counties , other men were doing the same . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ who'd treated the company _RARE_ as a natural _RARE_ , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with _RARE_ growing high in their yards . STO
* The small _RARE_ tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than _RARE_ were lying _RARE_ . STO
* No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic _RARE_ to free him any longer . STO
* _RARE_ , judge and _RARE_ were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could _RARE_ anywhere , at any time , to _RARE_ an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long _RARE_ . STO
* For three straight years , Tom Horn _RARE_ the southern Wyoming _RARE_ , and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known . STO
* It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by _RARE_ claiming every _RARE_ murder in the state . STO
* It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his _RARE_ _RARE_ him . STO
* For that _RARE_ was growing _RARE_ , _RARE_ was _RARE_ he received a price of $600 a man . STO
* ( The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about _RARE_ , very good money in an era when top hands worked for _RARE_ and found . STO
* ) _RARE_ had it he slipped two small rocks under each _RARE_ head as a sort of _RARE_ . STO
* ( A detailed search of old _RARE_ reports fails to _RARE_ this in the slightest . STO
* ) One thing was certain -- his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary . STO
* The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling _RARE_ out of the _RARE_ _RARE_ country in a single week . STO
* `` My _RARE_ my stock in trade '' , Tom mentioned more than once . STO
* He evidently couldn't _RARE_ that it might be his _RARE_ in the end . STO
* He had made himself the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ to the _RARE_ . STO
* But to the _RARE_ who had been facing _RARE_ from rustling losses and to the _RARE_ who had been faced with _RARE_ a few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of _RARE_ figure . STO
* Such ranchers as _RARE_ and Clay and the _RARE_ brothers carried him on their books as a _RARE_ even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown . STO
* He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their _RARE_ . STO
* In the cow camps , Tom Horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of _RARE_ he was when he entered and invariably won the local _RARE_ . STO
* The hands and their _RARE_ saw him as a lone _RARE_ of the range , _RARE_ a dedicated _RARE_ against a _RARE_ new society that was threatening a beloved way of life . STO
* The _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ of the cattle _RARE_ made up songs about him . STO
* By _RARE_ , rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming . STO
* When several minutes had passed and Curt hadn't emerged from the _RARE_ stable , Brenner _RARE_ the hotel and faced Summers across the counter . STO
* `` I have a little job for you , Charlie . STO
* I'm sure you won't mind doing me a small favor '' . STO
* _RARE_ voice was oily , but Summers wasn't _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ his lips _RARE_ . STO
* `` What is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner '' ? STO
* Brenner shrugged _RARE_ . STO
* `` It's very simple . STO
* I just want you to take a message to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Tell her to come here to the hotel '' . STO
* _RARE_ relieved , Summers nodded and started toward the door . STO
* `` One thing , Summers '' , Brenner said . STO
* `` You're not to mention my name . STO
* Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her '' . STO
* Summers pulled up short , and turned around . STO
* `` I don't know , Mr. Brenner '' , he said _RARE_ , beginning to get an _RARE_ of _RARE_ plans . STO
* `` It doesn't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that . STO
* _RARE_ I just '' -- His voice trailed off into silence . STO
* Brenner continued to smile , but his eyes were cold . STO
* He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed . STO
* `` You know , Summers '' , he said thoughtfully . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ought to have a fire company . STO
* If someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a _RARE_ '' . STO
* He started toward the stairway , then turned to add , `` Tell her to come to _RARE_ room , that Adams is in trouble . STO
* Tell her to hurry '' . STO
* `` Yes sir '' . STO
* His face pale , Summers headed for the street . STO
* Curt's visit to the _RARE_ stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching . STO
* He paused only long enough to _RARE_ that Jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right , then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside . STO
* The fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that _RARE_ information had been wrong , but Curt didn't interpret it this way . STO
* A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed . STO
* Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding . STO
* From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street . STO
* Curt approached the place _RARE_ , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees . STO
* There was a light in Black's front room , but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior . STO
* Curt circled the house and located a barn out back . STO
* He could hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else . STO
* There was no lock on the door , only an iron _RARE_ which he _RARE_ . STO
* He opened the door and went in , pulling it shut behind him . STO
* Again he stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ _RARE_ on a plank floor . STO
* He moved ahead carefully , his left hand in front of him , and came to a wooden _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ smell was very strong , and he could hear the _RARE_ of grain being ground between strong jaws . STO
* He found a match in his pocket and lit it . STO
* There were two horses in the barn , a _RARE_ _RARE_ and Jess _RARE_ buckskin . STO
* Curt _RARE_ out the match . STO
* It was certain now that Jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was _RARE_ Black . STO
* Curt wanted to get Jess alone , without interference from anyone , even as _RARE_ a person as the store owner . STO
* He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved . STO
* _RARE_ across the side of the stall , he slapped the buckskin on the _RARE_ . STO
* The startled animal let out a _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ around in the stall . STO
* As Curt had hoped , the house door _RARE_ open . STO
* He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall . STO
* Curt moved over beside the door and waited . STO
* Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard , and Jess's _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The door swung open , and Jess said _RARE_ , `` What the _RARE_ the matter with you ? STO
* '' The horse continued to _RARE_ . STO
* Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much _RARE_ in its _RARE_ voice . STO
* Jess cursed again , and entered the barn . STO
* A match _RARE_ , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop . STO
* As he crossed to the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer . STO
* `` Before you try anything '' , he said . STO
* `` Remember what happened to _RARE_ '' . STO
* Jess caught his breath in surprise . STO
* He started to reach for his gun , but apparently thought better of it . STO
* `` That's the stuff '' , Curt said . STO
* `` Just hold it that way '' . STO
* He reached out to pull the door shut and _RARE_ it with a sliding bolt . STO
* `` You and I have a little talking to do , Jess . STO
* You won't be needing this '' . STO
* He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster . STO
* `` Damn you , Adams '' -- Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock . STO
* `` We ain't got nothing to talk about . STO
* If I don't come back in the house , _RARE_ going to '' -- `` Your _RARE_ brother isn't in the house . STO
* About now he's probably having supper . STO
* That long ride the four of you took _RARE_ given him a good appetite . STO
* Now turn around so I can see your face '' . STO
* Jess turned . STO
* There was raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen . STO
* `` You're about as dumb as they come , Adams . STO
* I don't know what you're up to , but when Brenner '' -- `` You can forget about Brenner , too '' , Curt said . STO
* `` It's Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about '' . STO
* `` Arbuckle '' ? STO
* Jess stiffened . STO
* `` I don't know _RARE_ about him '' . STO
* `` No ? STO
* I suppose you don't know anything about a piece of _RARE_ , either ; ; one with blood all over it , _RARE_ blood '' . STO
* Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun . STO
* `` So help me , _RARE_ , I'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before I do , I'm going to hear you admit killing him . STO
* Now start talking . STO
* Who told you to do it ? STO
* Was it Dutch Brenner '' ? STO
* Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand . STO
* He drew back his arm to _RARE_ the _RARE_ across Jess's face , but didn't finish the motion . STO
* _RARE_ an _RARE_ man might come easy to someone like Jess , but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it . STO
* Apparently sensing this , and _RARE_ that it gave him an advantage , Jess became bold . STO
* `` Having all the guns makes you a big man , don't it , Adams ? STO
* If we was both armed , you wouldn't talk so tough '' . STO
* `` No '' ? STO
* Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster . STO
* He retreated a step and _RARE_ his own . STO
* `` All right , _RARE_ ; ; we're on even terms . STO
* Now draw '' ! STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ out on Jess's _RARE_ face . STO
* The fingers of his right hand twisted into a _RARE_ , but he didn't reach for the gun . STO
* Curt , angry enough to be a little _RARE_ , raised his hands shoulder high . STO
* `` Does this make it any easier , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` I ain't _RARE_ against you '' , Jess said _RARE_ . STO
* `` I heard how you _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I ain't a _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` No . STO
* You're the kind of bastard who _RARE_ up on a man from behind and _RARE_ him with a club . STO
* I just wanted to hear you say so '' . STO
* Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides . STO
* He had found Curt's weakness , or what to Jess was a weakness , and was smart enough to take advantage of it . STO
* Somewhere in the distance , a woman screamed . STO
* Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention . STO
* He had to make Jess talk , and he had to do it before _RARE_ Black got curious and came to investigate . STO
* Once more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin . STO
* He dropped his own beside it . STO
* `` We'll do it another way , then '' , he said _RARE_ . STO
* Jess's _RARE_ features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist . STO
* With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack . STO
* Curt managed to duck beneath the man's _RARE_ fist , and drove home a solid left to Jess's _RARE_ . STO
* It was like hitting a _RARE_ of salt . STO
* _RARE_ shot up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder , but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit . STO
* He slammed into the wall , bounced back , and caught Curt with a _RARE_ right which sent him spinning . STO
* An inch lower and it would have knocked him out . STO
* As it was , his vision _RARE_ and for a moment he was unable to move . STO
* When his eyes began to focus , he saw Jess charging at him with a _RARE_ . STO
* Curt twisted to one side , and the _RARE_ of the fork bit into the floor . STO
* Jess wasted a few seconds trying to _RARE_ them loose . STO
* It gave Curt time to _RARE_ to his feet . STO
* The _RARE_ broke off under Jess's twisting , and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out . STO
* His aim was hurried ; ; so the _RARE_ whistled over Curt's head . STO
* By now Curt was seeing clearly again . STO
* He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two _RARE_ to the big man's belly , putting everything he had behind them . STO
* They made Jess double over . STO
* When his head came down , Curt grabbed him by the hair and _RARE_ him head first into the wall . STO
* The building shook , setting the lantern to _RARE_ , and the buckskin to _RARE_ again . STO
* Even Black's old _RARE_ began to _RARE_ , and from the house Black yelled , `` Jess ! STO
* What's going on out there '' ? STO
* Jess didn't seem too sure himself . STO
* He lurched _RARE_ to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall . STO
* Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor . STO
* Jess had had enough . STO
* Blood _RARE_ from his nose , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's fists . STO
* Curt was in almost as bad shape , but he wouldn't quit . STO
* He backed Jess into a corner , grabbed a _RARE_ of the man's _RARE_ , and drew back his right fist . STO
* `` Tell me about Arbuckle ! STO
* You killed him , didn't you '' ? STO
* `` It was _RARE_ idea '' , Jess mumbled , _RARE_ at his nose . STO
* `` He found out about you and Arbuckle talking . STO
* He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble '' . STO
* `` You mean anyone who stood up for his rights '' , Curt said . STO
* He let go of the shirt , and Jess slumped to the floor . STO
* Turning his back , Curt crossed to the stall , reached over to _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ rope , and waved his hand in the _RARE_ face . STO
* The buckskin _RARE_ out of the stall . STO
* Curt moved in and picked up his gun . STO
* He shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster . STO
* Leaving Jess's where it lay , he left the stall . STO
* `` Get up , _RARE_ . STO
* We're going _RARE_ '' . STO
* Jess painfully got to his feet as someone _RARE_ the door . STO
* `` Who's in there '' ? STO
* Black called _RARE_ . STO
* Curt opened the door , grabbed Black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn . STO
* `` You're staying right here for a while . STO
* This dirty _RARE_ just admitted killing Arbuckle . STO
* I'm going to let him tell it to somebody else '' . STO
* He shoved Black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at Jess . STO
* `` Get out of here . STO
* You're coming along _RARE_ , or I'll put a bullet in your leg '' . STO
* Jess stumbled through the door . STO
* Curt followed , reaching behind him to shut the door and _RARE_ it . STO
* Black would have little trouble getting out , but it might delay him a few minutes . STO
* `` _RARE_ you _RARE_ me '' ? STO
* Jess asked _RARE_ . STO
* `` We're going to Marshal _RARE_ house . STO
* Maybe if the marshal _RARE_ this himself , it'll make a difference . STO
* Somebody in this town must still have some _RARE_ '' . STO
* Over his shoulder he could see _RARE_ loose grin and the _RARE_ _RARE_ faces . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , he whispered . STO
* `` Soon as we send them on their way and make camp , let's you and me go for a walk down by the _RARE_ -- all by ourselves '' . STO
* `` Sally '' , _RARE_ her mother , `` you've got all evening to visit with Dan . STO
* His _RARE_ need dressing now '' . STO
* Mrs. _RARE_ words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for _RARE_ . STO
* What a spectacle he was , _RARE_ with dirt and sweat and blood , filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian , kissing the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , and absolutely the _RARE_ girl in this whole wonderful world . STO
* He released her _RARE_ for her enthusiastic _RARE_ with Old _RARE_ . STO
* `` Got a lot to tend to , but I'll get back quick as I can '' , he assured her . STO
* Dan could hear Clayton Burnside and _RARE_ Jackson _RARE_ up their final _RARE_ for _RARE_ on the oxen . STO
* Jackson was doing most of the talking . STO
* So long as _RARE_ _RARE_ was coming out best on the _RARE_ , Dan didn't feel the need of putting in his _RARE_ worth . STO
* Soon as the Burnsides moved on , he'd lead _RARE_ down by the river ; ; there he could _RARE_ and scrub himself up for the evening . STO
* Damn it , he thought bitterly , picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve . STO
* If I hadn't got Nate stopped when I did , my _RARE_ all be shot plumb to hell ! STO
* He _RARE_ , picked up his ruined hat , and _RARE_ his lips thoughtfully . STO
* From the way the wound in his head was _RARE_ , Dan knew that it would _RARE_ . STO
* But his only hat was something else again . STO
* `` Nate ! STO
* Nate '' ! STO
* He shouted . STO
* The Burnsides , now ready to roll , were _RARE_ _RARE_ to his cry . STO
* `` Nate '' ! STO
* He bellowed to the _RARE_ back directly in front of him . STO
* `` I ain't going to fight you no more '' . STO
* Nate turned his head , attempting to speak in a _RARE_ voice . STO
* `` I know you ain't '' ! STO
* Dan _RARE_ , feeling ten feet tall . STO
* He moved in close , jerked the handsome , _RARE_ _RARE_ hat from _RARE_ head and clamped it on his own . STO
* `` Here's a present for you '' , he said , shoving his _RARE_ hat down over _RARE_ _RARE_ forehead . STO
* `` Me and _RARE_ trading hats _RARE_ you'll have something permanent to remember me by '' ! STO
* Sally left her _RARE_ to stand beside Dan . STO
* _RARE_ her hand in his , they silently watched the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight . STO
* Much as they had to look forward to , they didn't _RARE_ a moment of the time they spent seeing them go . STO
* At first Matilda could not believe her own eyes . STO
* She had spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and _RARE_ to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but _RARE_ . STO
* And now she could see him , looking _RARE_ handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their _RARE_ wagon . STO
* Seeing them waiting there at the foot of _RARE_ Rock was so _RARE_ that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all . STO
* Then , with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward _RARE_ in her _RARE_ face , Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon `` Pa ! STO
* Pa ! STO
* I can see Dan . STO
* And he's with the _RARE_ '' ! STO
* `` What about Burnsides '' ? STO
* Hez asked , who still believed they'd have them to _RARE_ . STO
* `` They ain't even in sight '' ! STO
* She replied . STO
* By then Hez could see for himself , and so could the others . STO
* Soon they were all shouting _RARE_ , _RARE_ smiles , and _RARE_ to think that they were all back together again . STO
* But even a _RARE_ as joyous as this one did not make a break in the _RARE_ of the day . STO
* Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , _RARE_ the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires . STO
* Then , and only then , with the _RARE_ and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the _RARE_ take time to catch up on the news . STO
* No sooner did they hear of _RARE_ injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action . STO
* The wound in his _RARE_ was examined , pronounced _RARE_ , and well _RARE_ with _RARE_ , before they _RARE_ up the _RARE_ . STO
* From then on , in keeping with the _RARE_ they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to _RARE_ their food . STO
* Even Sally , in spite of her _RARE_ and obvious welcome , followed the old _RARE_ of `` _RARE_ the _RARE_ when wearing the _RARE_ '' . STO
* After their supper , the evening turned into a regular `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* Only , they carefully substituted old country folk _RARE_ for the Virginia _RARE_ and square _RARE_ that were so popular among more _RARE_ trains in the great _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But with Bill _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , and Gran _RARE_ _RARE_ shouting `` _RARE_ Be '' and `` _RARE_ '' above their united _RARE_ of the _RARE_ old _RARE_ , they played their quaint folk games with all the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of a real celebration . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he _RARE_ stood by her side among the _RARE_ _RARE_ , `` don't that _RARE_ make you wish the Bible didn't say us _RARE_ can't dance '' ? STO
* `` Nor _RARE_ , neither '' , she replied . STO
* `` Not that it matters to me , being this far along '' . STO
* Rod gave her a warm _RARE_ on the shoulder before he replied . STO
* `` Come spring , you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling _RARE_ again too , _RARE_ '' . STO
* At these words of sympathy and understanding , Harmony said _RARE_ , `` I don't mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and join in the games '' . STO
* Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply , `` I ain't much of a hand for _RARE_ and _RARE_ , but I'd sure like to get in on the _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' . STO
* He looked down at his big hands and slowly _RARE_ his long fingers . STO
* `` Don't _RARE_ there's nobody out there , _RARE_ maybe Dan , who can _RARE_ me , Harmony '' . STO
* With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff , Harmony settled on the edge of the _RARE_ box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her _RARE_ legs , and worried about all that might have happened to Sally . STO
* And she was deeply _RARE_ that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , _RARE_ circle , _RARE_ and singing , `` _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ , the farmer in the _RARE_ '' . STO
* At the sight of _RARE_ happy face and _RARE_ expression , _RARE_ dark , brooding eyes quickly _RARE_ with _RARE_ tears . STO
* She was glad , completely and _RARE_ glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan . STO
* And she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod . STO
* But she couldn't , not yet . STO
* Not with the memory of her folks and the lost _RARE_ still holding her close . STO
* Out in the center of the circle the farmer , who was Dan , wasted no time when they came to the line , `` The farmer choose his wife '' . STO
* With a swift _RARE_ of his big arms , he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him , and then kissed her _RARE_ before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their `` outfit '' . STO
* Soon the child , the dog , the cat and even the cheese , all joined them out there in the circle . STO
* By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were _RARE_ and resting , or else _RARE_ off from the games by the challenging _RARE_ of the great cliff towering above them . STO
* No matter how many _RARE_ rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal . STO
* Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this _RARE_ . STO
* Already a few _RARE_ folk from their own train were _RARE_ _RARE_ away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains . STO
* Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them . STO
* No sooner were they through and the guards _RARE_ , than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep . STO
* For Matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night . STO
* Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first _RARE_ , _RARE_ sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into _RARE_ Valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains . STO
* Next morning , they moved on again . STO
* `` My _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Gran _RARE_ exclaimed , watching their _RARE_ muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load . STO
* `` A body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud '' ! STO
* Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of her _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ embarrassed _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ , Gran '' , they said almost in _RARE_ . STO
* `` That wasn't nothing at all '' ! STO
* _RARE_ forward in her chair , Gran _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ face . STO
* `` How's Sally like _RARE_ _RARE_ that _RARE_ little _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ him , Gran '' , Rod protested . STO
* `` I ain't _RARE_ him '' ! STO
* Gran peered again at the _RARE_ blond _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ upper lip . STO
* `` But _RARE_ , I've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon '' . STO
* The two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold _RARE_ and water _RARE_ , placed the chamber pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice . STO
* `` _RARE_ worse , Pa '' ? STO
* Dan asked Hez , who had _RARE_ back from his team to hold the _RARE_ chair _RARE_ in place while his boys swung up the _RARE_ and tied it tight at the ends . STO
* `` My right _RARE_ stiff as a board this morning '' , he replied . STO
* `` But the _RARE_ _RARE_ it _RARE_ me _RARE_ we _RARE_ to rolling '' . STO
* The three men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain _RARE_ signal . STO
* Hez looked up at the high face of _RARE_ Rock , official _RARE_ for the _RARE_ River _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , `` Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their _RARE_ up _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ what made them hurry so '' , Rod _RARE_ , giving Dan a _RARE_ wink . STO
* Dan grinned , and changed the subject . STO
* `` From now on , Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and _RARE_ outfit '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ no sense you eating our dust '' , Rod protested . STO
* `` Sally and her _RARE_ want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along '' , Dan explained . STO
* `` Jackson _RARE_ his _RARE_ , and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up . STO
* He's got the _RARE_ running gear in the train now . STO
* Besides , _RARE_ no _RARE_ right for me to follow with my black oxen , _RARE_ I can _RARE_ and pull up fast if either of you get in a _RARE_ '' . STO
* Captain _RARE_ signal shot sent the men _RARE_ to their waiting teams . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ right , Dan '' , Hez called back over his shoulder . STO
* `` I'll shore be needing _RARE_ both on the pull out o' the canyon '' . STO
* Rod looked _RARE_ ahead at the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` We'll double teams _RARE_ up the mountain , Harmony '' , he spoke _RARE_ , concerned by the _RARE_ look around her mouth . STO
* `` Like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown '' . STO
* Out of the corner of his eye , he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn . STO
* Before Harmony had a chance to reply , Rod cracked his long whip over his thin _RARE_ backs . STO
* While no larger than Dutch _RARE_ , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far _RARE_ and more _RARE_ . STO
* Men crowded the streets and freight _RARE_ and teams were moving about . STO
* Although they were forced to maintain a _RARE_ watch , this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their _RARE_ without any particular attention being paid them . STO
* `` _RARE_ be _RARE_ forth in some bar if he's here at all '' , Cobb declared , glancing along the street as they stretched their legs . STO
* There were no less than six or seven _RARE_ in _RARE_ , not counting the lower class _RARE_ , all _RARE_ for the trade of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Pat only nodded . STO
* `` Take one side of the street , and I'll take the other '' , he proposed . STO
* `` If you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ was tight . STO
* `` You do the same . STO
* It's all I ask , Stevens '' . STO
* _RARE_ , they took different sides of the main drag and systematically _RARE_ the bars . STO
* Russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero . STO
* Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually , even were he to prove the thief . STO
* He _RARE_ out of the _RARE_ _RARE_ with his hopes _RARE_ , and headed _RARE_ for the Palace _RARE_ , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street . STO
* The Palace was an elaborate establishment , built practically on _RARE_ in front , with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch . STO
* Behind its _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ dive clung like a _RARE_ nest to the rocky ribs of the _RARE_ . STO
* Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch . STO
* The front windows of the place were long and narrow , reaching nearly to the floor and _RARE_ an unusually good view of the interior . STO
* _RARE_ for the _RARE_ , Cobb glanced _RARE_ through the nearest window , and suddenly _RARE_ aside . STO
* _RARE_ tight as a _RARE_ , he paused to gather his _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ all expectation , Carmer was inside , clearly enjoying himself to the _RARE_ and already so _RARE_ that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him . STO
* _RARE_ anger surged through Russ . STO
* He fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious _RARE_ on the spot . STO
* _RARE_ the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he _RARE_ scanned the busy street below . STO
* Stevens was nowhere in sight . STO
* _RARE_ an _RARE_ , Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down . STO
* As luck had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared . STO
* `` What luck , Cobb '' ? STO
* He said swiftly . STO
* Russ pointed upward . STO
* `` He's there '' , he got out _RARE_ , _RARE_ his rising excitement . STO
* _RARE_ his _RARE_ belt around , Pat glanced upward briefly at the Palace and started that way with Cobb at his side . STO
* _RARE_ the steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door . STO
* Pat pushed through first . STO
* _RARE_ behind him _RARE_ , Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside . STO
* His eyes _RARE_ . STO
* While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy _RARE_ , with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure , it was now as _RARE_ and dull as the day before _RARE_ . STO
* Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen . STO
* A man knocked the _RARE_ ball about idly in its track , and another _RARE_ at one of the card tables . STO
* Two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the _RARE_ bartender absently polished a glass . STO
* _RARE_ the setup over , Stevens started _RARE_ for the rear of the place . STO
* `` Where _RARE_ goin' '' ? STO
* It was the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , Pat turned to survey him deliberately . STO
* He did not reply , going on toward the back . STO
* Less assured than the tall , _RARE_ man in the lead , Cobb followed _RARE_ , a hand on his gun butt . STO
* The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it . STO
* He said no more . STO
* A hall opened in back of the bar , running toward an _RARE_ . STO
* Pat moved into it . STO
* _RARE_ rooms , probably for cards , opened off on either side . STO
* All the doors were open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder . STO
* The door was locked . STO
* A single kick made it spring open , _RARE_ . STO
* Pat saw Gyp Carmer _RARE_ forward , a _RARE_ bottle _RARE_ as if to strike . STO
* Russ sprang through to bat it _RARE_ aside . STO
* With a _RARE_ Carmer _RARE_ at him . STO
* But he was more than _RARE_ , and his _RARE_ were _RARE_ . STO
* Cobb _RARE_ a single powerful _RARE_ that sent Gyp _RARE_ wildly and _RARE_ down with a whining _RARE_ . STO
* He started to struggle up , _RARE_ desperately . STO
* Russ gave him a _RARE_ thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach . STO
* _RARE_ , Cobb _RARE_ a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him _RARE_ . STO
* `` Okay , Stevens . STO
* I've drawn his _RARE_ '' , he snapped . STO
* `` Go through his pockets , will you ? STO
* If we have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of '' ! STO
* _RARE_ methodically , Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing . STO
* Cobb watched this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope _RARE_ by the moment . STO
* Stevens was _RARE_ over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly rose and _RARE_ toward _RARE_ hat , which had tumbled _RARE_ feet away when he first fell . STO
* Cobb got it . STO
* _RARE_ up , his eyes _RARE_ , he held out the battered _RARE_ . STO
* `` Look at this '' ! STO
* Inside the crown , _RARE_ behind the stained _RARE_ , could be seen thin , _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ ingenious _RARE_ for his _RARE_ had been found . STO
* `` By _RARE_ , Stevens ! STO
* You were right '' , Russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of _RARE_ hat . STO
* `` That is , if we can be sure this is _RARE_ money '' -- Pat grunted . STO
* `` Where else would he get it ? STO
* _RARE_ what you've got there , Cobb . STO
* We can soon tell '' . STO
* Russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any _RARE_ would come by honestly . STO
* Pat nodded . STO
* `` It's within a hundred of what _RARE_ had '' , he declared . STO
* `` We know Penny spent some -- and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on '' . STO
* _RARE_ the money over , Russ wiped his hands on his _RARE_ as if _RARE_ himself of something _RARE_ . STO
* His glance at Gyp Carmer was _RARE_ . STO
* `` Shall we get out of here '' ? STO
* Leaving the card room , they moved back through the Palace the way they had come . STO
* _RARE_ looks met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to _RARE_ them . STO
* _RARE_ in the outside door to glance behind him , Pat looked his _RARE_ warning and stepped out . STO
* He and Cobb _RARE_ down the high steps to the street . STO
* Neither spoke till they reached their horses . STO
* Pat paused there , looking across at the young fellow . STO
* It'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to _RARE_ and tell him about it , Russ '' . STO
* He started to return it . STO
* To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand . STO
* `` Not me '' , he ruled _RARE_ . STO
* I've had enough . STO
* It was you that _RARE_ it down anyway , Stevens '' , he _RARE_ strictly . STO
* `` I'll _RARE_ along home '' . STO
* `` Whatever you say '' . STO
* Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed _RARE_ . STO
* `` Old _RARE_ wasn't '' , _RARE_ Cobb _RARE_ . STO
* `` He'll know when you tell him . STO
* But I want this to sink in _RARE_ . STO
* Then maybe next time he won't be so quick on the trigger '' . STO
* `` Pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs . STO
* `` You're the doctor '' , he returned with a smile . STO
* `` But I still think _RARE_ an awful nice girl , Russ '' -- `` You don't have to tell me '' , flashed Cobb . STO
* _RARE_ the other a dark look , he _RARE_ his _RARE_ around and _RARE_ down off the street . STO
* Pat let him go , following more _RARE_ . STO
* At the first restaurant he _RARE_ pulled up to go in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* The truth was , the _RARE_ was both bewildered and _RARE_ by his own mixed luck . STO
* `` _RARE_ always glad to see me over there '' , he _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Yet had he not visited the girl at _RARE_ Buck he would never have been involved in this latest _RARE_ . STO
* Over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion of _RARE_ _RARE_ part in recent events . STO
* `` Gyp Carmer couldn't have known about _RARE_ money unless he was told -- and who else would have told him '' ? STO
* He asked himself . STO
* `` It's the second time War _RARE_ hands made a play for that money . STO
* How much of an accident could that be '' ? STO
* _RARE_ home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun . STO
* In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; ; but on the range gunfire had a meaning . STO
* _RARE_ up , Russ listened carefully . STO
* Two minutes later it came again -- a double explosion , followed by a third , _RARE_ more distant . STO
* As near as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the _RARE_ ranch house . STO
* He tightened up in a _RARE_ . STO
* So far as he knew , only his father could be there . STO
* What did it mean ? STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ to the _RARE_ he set off at a sharp _RARE_ , with growing alarm . STO
* His first glimpse of the ranch house across the _RARE_ _RARE_ told him nothing . STO
* Still a _RARE_ away , the fresh _RARE_ of guns only served to increase his speed . STO
* _RARE_ a course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee _RARE_ past close to his face . STO
* When it was followed by a second , whining even closer , Cobb _RARE_ sharply aside into a depression . STO
* He knew now what he was up against . STO
* Whoever was out there hiding in the _RARE_ cover was _RARE_ the _RARE_ house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight . STO
* _RARE_ himself for having _RARE_ out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot , Russ drew his _RARE_ and examined it briefly . STO
* If he wondered whether the _RARE_ would allow him to pull away _RARE_ , he had his answer a moment later . STO
* `` Over this way ! STO
* He ain't gone far '' ! STO
* A _RARE_ cry floated to him across the brush . STO
* A _RARE_ cracked more loudly , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ fragments from the brush off at one side . STO
* The _RARE_ assassin had his position figured pretty close . STO
* _RARE_ , Russ looked about hastily . STO
* _RARE_ the west this depression led toward a draw . STO
* _RARE_ his pony , he hurried that way , not _RARE_ till he was well below the level of the surrounding range . STO
* _RARE_ up then , and bending forward over the horn , he urged his mount down the _RARE_ draw . STO
* He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind . STO
* He had been _RARE_ , and his _RARE_ _RARE_ shot after shot . STO
* A shot or two went wild before Cobb felt something _RARE_ at his foot . STO
* A _RARE_ had torn half of his _RARE_ away . STO
* A second _RARE_ his _RARE_ , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm . STO
* Another _RARE_ close overhead . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ! STO
* Let's get out of here '' ! STO
* At the first shot Russ had _RARE_ his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw . STO
* The long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless . STO
* _RARE_ a look around , he saw that he was safe for the moment . STO
* He heard _RARE_ from behind him , but he could make out no words . STO
* He dashed _RARE_ for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made it . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ sidewise into an _RARE_ draw , he plunged forward with _RARE_ speed . STO
* _RARE_ the wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range . STO
* Yet he must chance it . STO
* He clambered out of the _RARE_ wash , the loose dirt flying behind him , and flashed a look about . STO
* Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions . STO
* And _RARE_ _RARE_ put its first marks on the combat record . STO
* Every plane that could fly was sent into the air . STO
* _RARE_ took eight ships and went south across the _RARE_ and along the north coast of _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target . STO
* _RARE_ with eight was to patrol the _RARE_ Gulf area , with his main task to get any _RARE_ before they got to the ships . STO
* Greg himself took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around _RARE_ on the east coast of _RARE_ . STO
* Each plane carried two _RARE_ pound _RARE_ . STO
* A weapons carrier took Greg , Todman , _RARE_ , _RARE_ Ferguson , and _RARE_ and the others the two miles from the _RARE_ area to the strip . STO
* It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes . STO
* No one had much to say . STO
* The sky _RARE_ down at them . STO
* There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever . STO
* The truck dropped them off at the various _RARE_ spread through the jungle . STO
* Donovan snatched Greg's _RARE_ from him with a _RARE_ motion and almost ran to the plane with it . STO
* His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot . STO
* Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before . STO
* But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the _RARE_ procedure . STO
* `` I've got her as neat as I can '' , Donovan said , as he dropped the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ harness over Greg's shoulders . STO
* `` But this goddamn climate . STO
* It's for _RARE_ not airplanes '' . STO
* `` We'll make out . STO
* Don't you worry , chief '' , Greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it . STO
* `` Yeah . STO
* See you '' , Donovan said as he jumped off the wing . STO
* The expression was his _RARE_ , his open _RARE_ to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return . STO
* At the _RARE_ time , Greg started the engine and _RARE_ out . STO
* From the time the _RARE_ were pulled until the plane was out of sight , he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip . STO
* He wondered where the _RARE_ had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission . STO
* Yet long before the scheduled time for return , Donovan would be watching for every _RARE_ in the sky . STO
* Greg _RARE_ down the rough metal taxi strip , and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him . STO
* The dark brown _RARE_ hanging under each wing looked large and powerful . STO
* The _RARE_ heads looked _RARE_ small . STO
* The control tower gave him immediate _RARE_ permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan . STO
* Greg's mission was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off _RARE_ he saw the clouds were dropping down again . STO
* To the west , the dark green hills of _RARE_ were lost in the clouds about halfway up their _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ him the sea was a dark and _RARE_ gray . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ against his _RARE_ as he led the flight in and out of _RARE_ . STO
* The metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it . STO
* He possessed the _RARE_ _RARE_ horror of bad weather and instrument flying , and he wondered , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory . STO
* He _RARE_ in the warm cockpit . STO
* The overcast was solid above him . STO
* As far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it . STO
* They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated _RARE_ from _RARE_ and hope that it didn't close in before they returned . STO
* Greg pushed the radio _RARE_ on his throttle . STO
* `` Todman , let's try to go under this stuff . STO
* _RARE_ in close and we'll go up the valley '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' , Todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg . STO
* Greg took the formation wide around three _RARE_ attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf . STO
* He dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of _RARE_ , and _RARE_ into the opening that showed against the mountain . STO
* The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed _RARE_ turn . STO
* It was only a _RARE_ flight , but before it was through Greg felt himself developing a case of _RARE_ . STO
* The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer _RARE_ seemed about to close in . STO
* If the other _RARE_ were worried , they did not show it . STO
* The formation remained perfect . STO
* When the sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come out . STO
* He spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast . STO
* Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity . STO
* Once Todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him . STO
* `` Somebody beat us to it '' ! STO
* Todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation . STO
* _RARE_ continued to be limited , and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet . STO
* It was _RARE_ . STO
* His _RARE_ were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights . STO
* He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of _RARE_ claiming a kill . STO
* But Greg's area remained as _RARE_ as a Florida dawn . STO
* Finally , as time began to run out , he headed into _RARE_ and _RARE_ a group of houses that _RARE_ had thought might contain Japanese supplies . STO
* The low clouds made _RARE_ difficult . STO
* There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run . STO
* The accuracy was _RARE_ . STO
* One of Greg's _RARE_ hung up , and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it . STO
* Only one of the flight _RARE_ a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle . STO
* With their load of _RARE_ gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily . STO
* Greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home . STO
* _RARE_ , it was still open . STO
* Like a man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley . STO
* He was about to make a gas check on his flight when _RARE_ voice broke in : `` _RARE_ ! STO
* Three _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ o'clock level '' . STO
* Greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel . STO
* He saw them , _RARE_ against the gray , but closing fast . STO
* They were headed straight for each other on a _RARE_ course . STO
* _RARE_ or enemy ? STO
* The same old question . STO
* And only a few seconds to answer it . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Todman said excitedly , and hopefully . STO
* And then he thought Todman might be right . STO
* His mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He narrowed the shape down to two : either a _RARE_ or a U. S. Navy type aircraft . STO
* If it were the enemy , _RARE_ his position was correct . STO
* Japanese aircraft were strong on _RARE_ , American on speed and _RARE_ . STO
* His present maximum _RARE_ , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to _RARE_ his advantages . STO
* But it also made him _RARE_ to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he hadn't been spotted already . STO
* But the closing aircraft showed no sign of _RARE_ from their original course . STO
* In seconds , Greg made his decision . STO
* He pushed the radio _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ Blue , hit the deck . STO
* _RARE_ of throttle . STO
* Todman , you take the one on the left . STO
* I'll take the middle . STO
* _RARE_ , the one on the right . STO
* If they're _RARE_ . STO
* Let's make sure first '' . STO
* Greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* The planes , light with most of the gas burned out , responded _RARE_ . STO
* Greg's _RARE_ indicator was over _RARE_ when he leveled off just above the trees . STO
* The _RARE_ aircraft continued to come on . STO
* They appeared to be the enemy . STO
* Greg wished the Air Corps had continued to _RARE_ planes . STO
* There was , of course , no way for the other planes to get by them . STO
* It was a box . STO
* But they could turn and escape to the east . STO
* Greg pushed the radio _RARE_ again . STO
* `` Todman , drop your second element back . STO
* If any of us miss , they can pick up the pieces . STO
* Now let's make sure they're _RARE_ '' . STO
* Even as he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy . STO
* The shapes were _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ were showing up , slightly _RARE_ _RARE_ in the gray gloom . STO
* Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight . STO
* The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him . STO
* His hands shook . STO
* `` _RARE_ your guns , _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` They're _RARE_ . STO
* They're _RARE_ '' , came a high-pitched voice . STO
* `` Greg to _RARE_ Blue . STO
* One pass only . STO
* No turns . STO
* You'll _RARE_ your _RARE_ in this canyon . STO
* That's an order '' . STO
* He moved the flights over against one wall . STO
* It gave them all a chance to make a _RARE_ climbing turn attack and a _RARE_ that would not take them into the overcast or force a _RARE_ recovery . STO
* If the turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out . STO
* A hell of an _RARE_ for a barrel roll , but it could be done . STO
* Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and _RARE_ up the _RARE_ , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting . STO
* The clearly _RARE_ enemy continued on as if no one else were around . STO
* `` They haven't seen us '' , Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise . STO
* `` They haven't seen us '' . STO
* He hit the radio _RARE_ . STO
* `` Now , _RARE_ , now . STO
* Let's take 'em home '' . STO
* He _RARE_ back on the stick and felt his cheeks _RARE_ . STO
* Out of the corner of his eye , he watched his _RARE_ move out a bit and shoot up with him . STO
* _RARE_ , he thought . STO
* With the rapid rate of _RARE_ , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done . STO
* Just like shooting at a duck while _RARE_ a _RARE_ from a _RARE_ board . STO
* He tightened his turn . STO
* His nose up . STO
* It was going to be dangerous . STO
* _RARE_ aircraft in this small box . STO
* Please , dear God , make my _RARE_ good , he prayed . STO
* He took a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the _RARE_ in his circular sight and then added another . STO
* The enemy did not _RARE_ . STO
* It did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Now ! STO
* Greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger . STO
* The plane _RARE_ and slowed . STO
* Six red lines _RARE_ their way into the gray and vanished . STO
* As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them . STO
* Greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered . STO
* _RARE_ was with him . STO
* His burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ flew off in pieces . STO
* A large piece of engine _RARE_ vanished . STO
* It was all Greg had time to see . STO
* His _RARE_ for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost _RARE_ and heading up into the clouds . STO
* His speed was dropping rapidly . STO
* If he spun out now , he would join his _RARE_ on the ground . STO
* _RARE_ , stay clear , he prayed . STO
* He pushed stick and _RARE_ and entered the overcast on his back . STO
* He fought the panic of _RARE_ . STO
* He had no idea which was up and which was down . STO
* He held the controls where they had been . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ out over him and he felt the slick between his _RARE_ and the stick grip . STO
* His air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out . STO
* Over the rattling of _RARE_ , humming of tires and chattering of _RARE_ there was a charming melody of _RARE_ and tiny _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ air moving slowly through the open or _RARE_ side windows _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and occasionally a faint _RARE_ of perfume _RARE_ from the back seat . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone I once more repeated the _RARE_ , _RARE_ all my _RARE_ powers of _RARE_ to sound convinced . STO
* We were coming to an intersection , turning right , _RARE_ to a stop . STO
* _RARE_ to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road _RARE_ and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican : _RARE_ , New Mexico . STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ '' , I said , _RARE_ my Spanish vocabulary on my host and _RARE_ one of a _RARE_ store of smiles with my _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I waved with discretion and _RARE_ to the vague golden faces _RARE_ through rising dust and the _RARE_ of the back window glass . STO
* Then I saw the father's head slightly turn ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ shapes replaced the _RARE_ _RARE_ of gold . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ past . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ drivers stared _RARE_ toward the eastern horizon and past my _RARE_ and accusing gaze . STO
* Suddenly a _RARE_ _RARE_ horn _RARE_ , and , _RARE_ hopefully , I saw _RARE_ in _RARE_ flash : red lips , streaming silk of blonde hair and -- _RARE_ , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair -- the _RARE_ face of old _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , he _RARE_ , his white teeth _RARE_ _RARE_ those of the _RARE_ blonde . STO
* Over the _RARE_ _RARE_ of a jump seat piled high with luggage _RARE_ black _RARE_ was just discernible , near , or _RARE_ near that spot where -- hidden -- more _RARE_ , most _RARE_ _RARE_ hair must still be streaming back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly _RARE_ with _RARE_ and _RARE_ flowers and engine _RARE_ . STO
* Damn his luck . STO
* I would have _RARE_ my romantic chances rather than leave a friend _RARE_ and dusty and -- Well , at least I wouldn't have shouted back a _RARE_ . STO
* Still nursing anger I _RARE_ _RARE_ a car that was slowly approaching , its _RARE_ _RARE_ nearly _RARE_ me . STO
* It was stopping . STO
* Just as I straightened up with my _RARE_ bag , I heard : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ , meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck '' . STO
* The voice was that of Johnson , tail _RARE_ off another crew . STO
* _RARE_ a look between Johnson's fat _RARE_ and the car frame a handsome and still _RARE_ lady inquired `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ? STO
* I nodded . STO
* `` _RARE_ one _RARE_ '' , Mrs. Roebuck continued . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in Sante Fe , an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But _RARE_ Johnson has _RARE_ said it _RARE_ make no _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* I said that it didn't make any difference to me either , as far as I knew . STO
* How far I knew will shortly become apparent . STO
* Let me pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck `` _RARE_ if the _RARE_ speed limit '' ( 35 _RARE_ ) `` is still in _RARE_ '' . STO
* I let up on the accelerator , only to gradually reach again the 60 _RARE_ which would , I hoped , _RARE_ _RARE_ and the blonde , and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I , Mrs. Major Roebuck settled down to _RARE_ on _RARE_ Johnson the _RARE_ _RARE_ she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs. Somebody in Sante Fe . STO
* When Johnson _RARE_ `` _RARE_ my buying us all a nice cold _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Mrs. Roebuck _RARE_ _RARE_ and began suddenly to go on about her son , who was `` _RARE_ a little _RARE_ than you _RARE_ '' . STO
* Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age . STO
* Mrs. Roebuck thought Johnson was a `` sweet _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , but her _RARE_ was getting to be a man , there was no getting around it . STO
* `` Just _RARE_ he left _RARE_ his _RARE_ we _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , Major Roebuck an Ah , an _RARE_ says ' May Ah _RARE_ one too ' ? STO
* Just as _RARE_ an -- an _RARE_ , an Ah says ' _RARE_ _RARE_ you _RARE_ ' , but he says ' _RARE_ _RARE_ , you _RARE_ _RARE_ one ' ? STO
* An Ah _RARE_ _RARE_ him an so Ah said ' _RARE_ right , Ah _RARE_ , an his _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ one _RARE_ an _RARE_ _RARE_ was gone , the _RARE_ laughed an _RARE_ me _RARE_ he an the _RARE_ had been _RARE_ an occasional drink _RARE_ _RARE_ a yeah , _RARE_ an occasional one , but just the same it was _RARE_ _RARE_ back , an Ah _RARE_ think _RARE_ _RARE_ at all , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` No , I don't '' , Johnson said . STO
* `` I'm a good _RARE_ , and drinking '' Mrs. Roebuck very _RARE_ let me drive through Sante Fe to a road which would , she said , lead us to _RARE_ and then _RARE_ and `` _RARE_ '' out of New Mexico . STO
* How lightly her `` _RARE_ '' passed into the _RARE_ where I was _RARE_ dialect material for some vaguely dreamed _RARE_ , and how the word would echo . STO
* And _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ had Mrs. Roebuck driven off when a rusty _RARE_ truck , father or _RARE_ of _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' Ford _RARE_ , came screeching to a _RARE_ stop , and a brown face appeared , its nose threatened by _RARE_ of what had once been the side window . STO
* `` Get in , _RARE_ . STO
* Get in '' . STO
* The straight , black hair flopped in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back . STO
* Johnson _RARE_ the right hand door , whose window was , like the left one , merely _RARE_ fragments of glass , and Johnson _RARE_ himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer . STO
* `` In back , buddy '' , the driver said to me . STO
* _RARE_ but carefully _RARE_ my _RARE_ bag over the low _RARE_ , I stepped on the running board ; ; it flopped down , sprang back up and _RARE_ my _RARE_ . STO
* The truck was _RARE_ forward . STO
* I seized the rack and made a _RARE_ _RARE_ just in time , one of my knees _RARE_ landing on my _RARE_ bag -- and merely _RARE_ my camera , I was to discover later -- my other knee landing on the _RARE_ truck floor boards and -- but this is no medical report . STO
* I was again in motion and at a speed which _RARE_ the _RARE_ similarity to _RARE_ _RARE_ Ford _RARE_ . STO
* Maybe I would beat old _RARE_ to _RARE_ after all . STO
* Whatever satisfaction that might offer . STO
* Something pulled my leg . STO
* I drew back , drawing back my foot for a kick . STO
* But it was only Johnson reaching around the wire chicken _RARE_ , which half covered the truck _RARE_ _RARE_ rear window . STO
* The way his red rubber lips were stretched across his _RARE_ little teeth I thought he was only having a little joke , but , no , he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear . STO
* `` _RARE_ beer '' ? STO
* `` Hell , yes '' , I roared back between dusty lips . STO
* Did I want a beer ? STO
* Did an _RARE_ want _RARE_ ? STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ '' , I _RARE_ , my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately _RARE_ the size of my Spanish vocabulary . STO
* At once my ears were _RARE_ by a flow of what I took to be Spanish , but -- the driver's white teeth _RARE_ at me , the road wildly _RARE_ beyond his glistening hair , beyond his _RARE_ bottle -- it could have been the _RARE_ _RARE_ English I was half hearing ; ; I wouldn't have known the difference . STO
* Johnson was trying to grab the wheel , though the _RARE_ of the truck was throwing him away from it . STO
* White teeth suddenly _RARE_ , the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnson's ear . STO
* We were off the road , gleaming barbed wire pulling taut . STO
* I _RARE_ just as the first _RARE_ broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the _RARE_ . STO
* We were in a field , in a tight , screeching turn . STO
* _RARE_ dogs were _RARE_ up and _RARE_ down . STO
* When I fell on my back , I saw a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Just as I got to my knees , there was again the sound of the fence stretching , and I had time only to start taking my _RARE_ _RARE_ seriously . STO
* This time no wire came whipping into the truck . STO
* We were back on the road . STO
* I _RARE_ my _RARE_ position behind the truck _RARE_ rear window . STO
* Johnson's left hand was pressed against the side of his head , red cheeks _RARE_ beneath his fingers . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , the driver _RARE_ , his black eyes _RARE_ behind dull silver chicken _RARE_ . STO
* `` That was _RARE_ I was talking . STO
* You thought I was a Mexican , didn't you , buddy '' ? STO
* I nodded . STO
* `` Hell , that's all right , buddy '' , the Indian ( I now guessed ) said . STO
* `` _RARE_ your beer '' . STO
* _RARE_ , the bottle was still in my hand , foam still _RARE_ over my ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ watch . STO
* No sooner had I started drinking than the driver started _RARE_ the truck . STO
* The beer foamed furiously . STO
* I drank furiously . STO
* A long time . STO
* _RARE_ the bottle . STO
* _RARE_ again _RARE_ back at me , the driver released a _RARE_ of Spanish in which `` _RARE_ '' appeared every so often like an island in the _RARE_ waves of surrounding sound . STO
* I _RARE_ my head each time it appeared . STO
* Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son of a bitch '' , sometimes _RARE_ by vicious _RARE_ of a beer bottle into Johnson's quivering ribs . STO
* A big car was approaching , its _RARE_ teeth grinning . STO
* Beyond it the gray road stretched a long , long way . STO
* The car was just about to us , its driver's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in Sante Fe -- on anything but an old _RARE_ truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue . STO
* I tossed the bottle . STO
* High , so it would only _RARE_ _RARE_ but loudly off the car's steel roof . STO
* Too high . STO
* On _RARE_ _RARE_ the bottle shattered into a small _RARE_ flash . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* The Indian was again raising his bottle , but to my _RARE_ relief -- probably only a fraction of Johnson's -- the bottle this time went to the Indian's lips . STO
* Another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill . STO
* I started looking on the _RARE_ truck bed for a piece of board , a dirt _RARE_ -- anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle . STO
* We were slowing . STO
* In the ditch sand was white and _RARE_ , only an occasional _RARE_ discernible , faintly gleaming . STO
* But Johnson couldn't quickly _RARE_ the truck door , and if I escaped , he might suffer . STO
* The car was approaching fast . STO
* On the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery ; ; with more time I could have _RARE_ a small _RARE_ or _RARE_ pin -- Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the _RARE_ in my pocket . STO
* There was no time to pick out a _RARE_ ; ; I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger , leaned my _RARE_ in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and _RARE_ my little missile . STO
* There was a _RARE_ just under my focus of vision , a crash ; ; the car's far _RARE_ panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center . STO
* I heard the _RARE_ of _RARE_ behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me . STO
* _RARE_ back I saw a _RARE_ man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* Johnson's fat hand , another bottle were _RARE_ from the truck cab , and that _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , had a bottle at his own lips . STO
* Two cars came over a crest , their _RARE_ and glass _RARE_ . STO
* The Indian's arm whipped sidewise -- there was a flash of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ behind us . STO
* I saw Johnson's bottle snatched from his hand , saw it go in a _RARE_ of foam just behind the second car . STO
* This time there was no sound of _RARE_ but the _RARE_ of women . STO
* I looked back at pale _RARE_ framed in the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the car's rear window . STO
* `` _RARE_ , you son of a bitch '' ! STO
* I quickly turned around and began to drink . STO
* But the Indian was _RARE_ another bottle toward Johnson . STO
* I guided her to the divan , turned off the TV , faced her . STO
* She sat quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes . STO
* And what eyes they were . STO
* Big and dark , a melting , golden brown . STO
* Eyes like hot honey , eyes that _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ skin , smooth brow and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them . STO
* It was a _RARE_ familiar face , too , but I couldn't remember where we had met . STO
* I said , `` Do we know each other , Miss '' ? STO
* `` No , I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all I could think of was '' -- This time she stopped the rush of words herself . STO
* `` I'm sorry . STO
* Shall I go on '' ? STO
* She smiled . STO
* It was her first smile . STO
* But worth waiting for . STO
* `` Sure '' . STO
* I said . STO
* `` But one word at a time , O.K. '' ? STO
* She was still hugging the stained coat around her , so I said , `` _RARE_ , let me take your things . STO
* Would you like a drink , or coffee '' ? STO
* `` No , thanks '' . STO
* She stood up , pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off , then let out a high-pitched scream and I let out a _RARE_ , _RARE_ sound like a _RARE_ blowing out . STO
* She was wearing nothing beneath the coat . STO
* She jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough . STO
* There had been a good second or two during which my _RARE_ had been blowing out , and now I was certain I'd seen her somewhere before . STO
* `` I forgot '' ! STO
* She _RARE_ . STO
* `` Oh , do forgive me . STO
* I'm sorry '' ! STO
* `` I forgive '' -- `` That's what started all the trouble in the first place . STO
* Oh , dear , I'm all _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` You and me both , dear . STO
* _RARE_ we haven't I seen you . STO
* I mean , surely we've '' -- `` You may have seen me on TV '' , she said . STO
* `` I've done several _RARE_ commercials for '' -- Then it hit me . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* I cried . STO
* `` Why , yes . STO
* And you recognized me '' ? STO
* `` Yes , indeed . STO
* In fact , I was watching you on that little _RARE_ screen when you rang my bell . STO
* Man , you rang -- it was in color , too , Miss , and Miss ? STO
* What's your name , anyway ? STO
* Ah , you were _RARE_ '' . STO
* I sat by her on the divan . STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* In a _RARE_ and all that '' . STO
* `` That's the last one we did . STO
* That was a fun one '' . STO
* `` I'll bet . STO
* It was fun for me , all right . STO
* I don't mean to _RARE_ , but do they hide the _RARE_ with the bubbles ? STO
* I mean : Is advertising honest ? STO
* `` It depends on who does it . STO
* I never wear anything at all . STO
* It wouldn't -- wouldn't seem fair , somehow '' . STO
* `` I couldn't agree with you more '' . STO
* `` I really do have something important to tell you , Mr. _RARE_ . STO
* About the murder '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ ? STO
* Oh , yeah '' , I said . STO
* `` Tell me about the murder '' . STO
* She told me . STO
* _RARE_ was the creation of two men , Louis Thor and Bill Blake , partners in zing ! STO
* , Inc. . STO
* They'd _RARE_ the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when -- with the addition of `` _RARE_ '' to their secret formula and the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ advertising campaign -- sales had _RARE_ practically into orbit . STO
* Their product had been _RARE_ by Good _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ Journal , among other _RARE_ of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in the _RARE_ , even your best friends would think you didn't _RARE_ . STO
* My lovely _RARE_ -- Joyce _RARE_ was her name -- had previously done three _RARE_ commercials for zing , and this evening , the fourth , a _RARE_ production , had been _RARE_ at the home of Louis Thor . STO
* The water in _RARE_ big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , _RARE_ _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , of course , from zing -- Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then _RARE_ and _RARE_ in her _RARE_ `` bath '' while _RARE_ rolled . STO
* The finished -- and _RARE_ cut -- product would begin with a _RARE_ _RARE_ of Joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool's surface _RARE_ in layers of lavender _RARE_ , and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap ; ; even to clean men and boys . STO
* Joyce went on , `` When we'd finished , Lou -- Mr. Thor -- asked me to stay a little longer . STO
* He wanted a few _RARE_ for magazine ads , he said . STO
* Everybody left and I stayed in the pool , then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too . STO
* And he didn't have any clothes on '' . STO
* `` He didn't '' ! STO
* `` Yes , he didn't . STO
* Did , I mean '' . STO
* She paused . STO
* `` Did leap into the pool , and didn't have anything on . STO
* Anyway , it was evident what he had in mind '' . STO
* `` You got away , didn't you '' ? STO
* `` Yes . STO
* He caught up with me once and grabbed me , but I was all covered with zing -- it's very _RARE_ , you know '' . STO
* `` I didn't know . STO
* I wouldn't have the stuff in the house . STO
* But I'm pleased to hear '' -- `` So I just _RARE_ out of his _RARE_ . STO
* I swam like mad , got out of the pool , grabbed my _RARE_ , and ran to the car . STO
* The keys were still in it , and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little _RARE_ where I'd changed '' . STO
* She'd driven around for a while , Joyce said , then , thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time , she'd gone back to his home on _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , parked in front , and walked toward the pool . STO
* While several yards from it , still concealed by the _RARE_ , she'd seen two men on her left at the pool's edge . STO
* She went on : `` A man was holding onto Lou , holding him up . STO
* Maybe Lou was only unconscious , but right then I thought he must be dead . STO
* The man shoved him into the water , then ran past the _RARE_ . STO
* There's a walk there that goes out to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I was so scared well , I just ran to my car and came here '' . STO
* `` You know who the other man was '' ? STO
* `` No , I never did see his face . STO
* I didn't get a good look at him at all , his back was to me , and I was so scared It was just somebody in a man's suit . STO
* But I'm sure the other one was Lou '' . STO
* What Joyce wanted me to do was go to _RARE_ house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and _RARE_ containing her identification . STO
* She realized I'd have to notify the police , but _RARE_ hoped I could avoid _RARE_ her name . STO
* Her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an _RARE_ TV series , _RARE_ Western _RARE_ , a _RARE_ show to be sponsored by _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But if Joyce got involved in murder or _RARE_ scandal , the role would probably go to the _RARE_ wife , Mrs. _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Or at least not to Joyce . STO
* `` And I so want the part '' , she said . STO
* `` The commercials have just been for money , there hasn't been any real _RARE_ for me to do them , but in _RARE_ Western _RARE_ I'd have a chance to act . STO
* I could show what I can do '' . STO
* As far as I was concerned , she had already and had _RARE_ shown what she could do . STO
* But I promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ much relieved , she smiled one of those _RARE_ smiles , and I smiled all the way into the bedroom . STO
* There I got my _RARE_ Special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room . STO
* Joyce _RARE_ a little on the divan . STO
* `` I'm starting to _RARE_ '' , she said . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Yes , I'm still all covered with that soap . STO
* I was loaded with suds when I ran away , and I haven't had a chance to wash it off . STO
* _RARE_ , it sure _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` You might as well wait here while I'm gone , so you can use my shower if you'd like '' . STO
* `` Oh , I'd love to '' . STO
* I showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really don't mind , I think I'll get clean in the shower , then _RARE_ for a few minutes in your tub . STO
* That always _RARE_ me . STO
* _RARE_ it you '' ? STO
* `` Only when I do it '' . STO
* I shook my head . STO
* One of my _RARE_ or _RARE_ is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and _RARE_ living color . STO
* `` _RARE_ as long as you want , Joyce . STO
* It'll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you . STO
* So you'll have everything all to yourself , _RARE_ '' I looked at my watch . STO
* Ten after nine . STO
* Time to go , I supposed . STO
* `` Well , _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* You'd better hurry '' . STO
* `` Oh , you can count on that '' . STO
* She smiled slightly . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* `` Don't hurry too much . STO
* I'll be soaking for at least half an hour '' . STO
* That was all she said . STO
* But suddenly those _RARE_ eyes seemed to have everything but _RARE_ of bees in them . STO
* However , when there's a job to be done , I'm a _RARE_ of grim determination , I like to think . STO
* I spun about and _RARE_ through the front room to the door . STO
* As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower . STO
* _RARE_ water . STO
* She wouldn't be taking a cold shower . STO
* Hell , she couldn't . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ is only two or three miles from the _RARE_ , and it took me less than five minutes to get there . STO
* But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I'd expected . STO
* Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ in the big house and surrounding grounds . STO
* I followed a _RARE_ gravel path alongside the house to the pool . STO
* Two _RARE_ officers , a couple of _RARE_ I knew , and two other men stood on a gray _RARE_ area next to the pool on my left . STO
* At the pool's far end was the little _RARE_ Joyce had mentioned , and on the _RARE_ surface floated scattered lavender patches of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* A few yards beyond the group of men , a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green _RARE_ . STO
* Lieutenant _RARE_ , one of the _RARE_ , spotted me and said , `` Hi , Shell '' , and walked toward me . STO
* `` _RARE_ you hear about this one '' ? STO
* I grinned , but ignored the question . STO
* He didn't push it ; ; _RARE_ worked out of Central Homicide and we'd been friends for years . STO
* He filled me in . STO
* A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine _RARE_ , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now . STO
* Present at the scene -- in addition to the dead man , who was indeed Louis Thor -- had been _RARE_ partner Bill Blake , and _RARE_ Rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account . STO
* Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the _RARE_ session earlier . STO
* `` What were they doing here '' ? STO
* I asked _RARE_ . STO
* `` They were supposed to meet Thor at nine _RARE_ for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this _RARE_ stuff '' . STO
* `` Yeah , I've heard more about _RARE_ than space exploration lately . STO
* What is the _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` How would I know ? STO
* It's a secret . STO
* That was the new advertising angle -- something about a _RARE_ of London policy to insure the _RARE_ of the secret _RARE_ . STO
* Actually , only two men know what the formula is , Blake and '' -- He stopped and looked at _RARE_ body . STO
* I said , `` O.K. , so now only Blake knows . STO
* How's it strike you , _RARE_ or fair '' ? STO
* `` Can't say yet . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and _RARE_ on 'em . STO
* The _RARE_ might show he _RARE_ instead , but that's what the _RARE_ gives us . STO
* _RARE_ , murder , suicide -- take your pick '' . STO
* `` I'll pick murder . STO
* Anything else '' ? STO
* `` According to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a _RARE_ _RARE_ from the _RARE_ locker and started _RARE_ him out . STO
* Too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living ; ; this is not so , for education offers all kinds of dividends , including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife . STO
* If it were not for an old _RARE_ who made me read the _RARE_ I would have been _RARE_ on what to do , and now I understand why they are _RARE_ ; ; those who wrote them knew people and what made people _RARE_ . STO
* I worked for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild _RARE_ of _RARE_ ) who ran one of those antique shops in New _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the old French _RARE_ . STO
* The arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day . STO
* The rest of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting . STO
* I had a _RARE_ studio which _RARE_ an ancient _RARE_ filled with flowers and plants , _RARE_ _RARE_ in the southern sun . STO
* I had come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college , partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there . STO
* When my Uncle offered me a _RARE_ job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted . STO
* The arrangement turned out to be excellent . STO
* I loved the city and I particularly loved the _RARE_ and spirit of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another _RARE_ , joyous celebration with romance in the air ; ; and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of _RARE_ eyes were waiting around the next corner . STO
* The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure . STO
* It was as if they could hardly wait to get into their _RARE_ , cover their faces with _RARE_ and go _RARE_ . STO
* My Uncle and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages . STO
* Sometimes I wondered vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt , by blood , had died some years ago , but neither of us said anything . STO
* One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt . STO
* They were married over the _RARE_ , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty . STO
* She looked more like twenty-five or six . STO
* It was really a May and December combination . STO
* My new Aunt was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long time since I had seen as _RARE_ a woman who _RARE_ sex . STO
* There was something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like New Orleans _RARE_ , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not _RARE_ me . STO
* Her legs were the full , _RARE_ kind , full _RARE_ like a rare wine and just as _RARE_ to the appetite ; ; the _RARE_ was magnificent , the ankle perfect . STO
* You must forgive me if I seem to _RARE_ too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body . STO
* The true artist is like one of those _RARE_ who , from a single bone can _RARE_ an _RARE_ entire body . STO
* The artist looks at an ankle , a _RARE_ , a bosom and , in his _RARE_ eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is . STO
* And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store . STO
* That she impressed me instantly was obvious ; ; I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly _RARE_ them . STO
* I thought I saw a faint _RARE_ of color rise to her neck and quickly _RARE_ her cheeks . STO
* _RARE_ , she was my Aunt , married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , I did not know or much care . STO
* She was standing with her back to the glass door . STO
* Her form was _RARE_ and with the strong light I could see the _RARE_ of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired . STO
* As it is in so many affairs of the heart , a man and a woman meet and something _RARE_ . STO
* Something clicked in this instance , but I treated her _RARE_ and I felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance . STO
* When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was _RARE_ lest my Uncle notice it . STO
* And then I became aware that she , too , glanced at me _RARE_ . STO
* I felt that her eyes were _RARE_ me as if she were a painter and I a nude model . STO
* I dismissed these feelings as _RARE_ thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to _RARE_ on it because of our relationship . STO
* When our eyes met the air was filled with an _RARE_ message of `` Me , too '' . STO
* You have probably experienced this . STO
* It is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly _RARE_ with a high charge of electricity . STO
* Why she married him I do not know . STO
* I myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me . STO
* He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who _RARE_ the _RARE_ of living . STO
* Perhaps , with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ; or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ; some women with father _RARE_ do . STO
* For several weeks we eyed one another almost like _RARE_ partners , and then one day Uncle was slightly _RARE_ and stayed home ; ; his bride opened the store . STO
* I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a _RARE_ flush that _RARE_ her neck and moved _RARE_ to her cheeks , and _RARE_ I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights . STO
* The _RARE_ depth , _RARE_ with _RARE_ , echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk . STO
* She placed her palms , fingers _RARE_ , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , `` Now , what next '' ? STO
* I was aware of a _RARE_ look in her eyes that told me the time was _RARE_ . STO
* There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour . STO
* I was standing beside her , watching the _RARE_ palms and wondering about the old _RARE_ sofa against the wall on which he sometimes _RARE_ . STO
* I bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms _RARE_ me in a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Her mouth , which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender . STO
* I heard her _RARE_ , `` We'd better lock the door '' . STO
* It did not take me long to slip the bolt _RARE_ and return to the rear and its couch . STO
* When we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said : `` He will not always be _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I know . STO
* I was thinking about that . STO
* How will we work it out '' ? STO
* `` I don't know '' , she said . STO
* `` You're the man . STO
* You figure it out . STO
* I've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met '' . STO
* `` I guess we both felt it '' . STO
* I said . STO
* `` I guess so '' , she said . STO
* `` But now what '' ? STO
* Even as I said it I realized that an education can be _RARE_ . STO
* `` I know what we can do '' , I said . STO
* `` Tell him I made a pass at you '' . STO
* She raised a _RARE_ hand with a startled air . STO
* `` What are you trying to do ? STO
* Get thrown out ? STO
* If I even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew '' ? STO
* `` I don't want to be thrown out and I don't think I will . STO
* I think I have a way so we can carry on without his _RARE_ us '' . STO
* `` By telling him you are making passes at me '' ? STO
* She said _RARE_ . STO
* `` When I was in college '' , I grinned , `` I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class . STO
* I don't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or _RARE_ century poets . STO
* In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some _RARE_ to tell ; ; and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ opens officially . STO
* A lot of people will _RARE_ the streets in _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and having a ball . STO
* There will be romance and _RARE_ . STO
* If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a _RARE_ I really am . STO
* We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake _RARE_ . STO
* And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead . STO
* You are both the same size . STO
* He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy _RARE_ for a mask . STO
* When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it '' . STO
* `` But you '' -- she began . STO
* `` Don't worry about me . STO
* It will turn out all right '' . STO
* `` I don't understand '' , she insisted . STO
* `` Are you trying to cut your throat '' ? STO
* `` No '' , I chuckled , `` I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education '' . STO
* As we expected , on the following day my Uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning . STO
* I felt that he looked at me coldly and _RARE_ and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be , but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife . STO
* I quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days . STO
* I heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French _RARE_ after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date . STO
* _RARE_ before nine I drove my _RARE_ to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view . STO
* A few minutes later I saw my _RARE_ car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner . STO
* I must say the figure was well made up . STO
* If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him . STO
* In one hand he gripped firmly a _RARE_ though there had been no indication of rain . STO
* I suspected why he brought it along . STO
* In the half darkness I approached _RARE_ , making sure he did not see me . STO
* He was looking out on the dark waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without _RARE_ words I _RARE_ him hard across the face . STO
* `` You cheap bitch '' ! STO
* I exclaimed . STO
* `` You cheap , no good , _RARE_ bitch ! STO
* You get a good , loyal husband -- _RARE_ ! STO
* -- and you fall for a pass by his own nephew ! STO
* You should -- _RARE_ ! STO
* -- be ashamed of yourself . STO
* He had better write a _RARE_ to Walter . STO
* He opened the myth book again and there ( along the _RARE_ next to Robert _RARE_ imaginative interpretation of the creation of the _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ ) were the names of four _RARE_ bars and Meredith _RARE_ address . STO
* The bars were marked as Walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer . STO
* The _RARE_ , which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest , Nicolas was determined to find out and put to use . STO
* A card to Walter would get him an introduction to this Meredith , and that might be good for something . STO
* Nicolas called on his _RARE_ , a line came back : `` _RARE_ , man , and all the _RARE_ are _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* That ought to draw a laugh , Nicolas _RARE_ , as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind . STO
* And indeed , his _RARE_ did draw from Walter a letter recommending his friend , the poet Nicolas _RARE_ , to his friend Meredith _RARE_ . STO
* Five days later , on receiving it , Meredith sat _RARE_ his _RARE_ on his writing table . STO
* _RARE_ ! STO
* He _RARE_ cried . STO
* His hand was large and square and heavily tanned . STO
* The voice crying in him was the voice of guilt . STO
* His four weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months . STO
* He had returned to the _RARE_ a week ago . STO
* Now , he was just in the late poems of _RARE_ and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him -- plus next _RARE_ class preparation . STO
* He was determined to spend an _RARE_ summer . STO
* Well , maybe _RARE_ wouldn't call . STO
* _RARE_ fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him : _RARE_ _RARE_ , die _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ of _RARE_ gradually faded as Meredith asked himself should he translate it , ' How the dark _RARE_ laughed ' ? STO
* Or , more _RARE_ , ' The _RARE_ _RARE_ are laughing ' ? STO
* And he missed the point that the _RARE_ _RARE_ might be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas _RARE_ . STO
* But Nicolas , too , was being interrupted , that morning . STO
* Not by the _RARE_ sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him off to sleep ; ; but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and _RARE_ regarded him . STO
* Should she wake him ? STO
* She didn't have the heart . STO
* Her heart , her _RARE_ feeling , in fact her being was too busy expressing itself , as quietly _RARE_ by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a blanket , in a park like a scene from _RARE_ . STO
* She was just not able to break the spell . STO
* ( Would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet _RARE_ Nicolas had found his first night in one of _RARE_ marked bars ? STO
* Nicolas : `` Look , Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see ? STO
* So if all these _RARE_ was to get me in bed , man , you just spent a lot of money '' . STO
* Ballet _RARE_ : _RARE_ , tears , and `` take what you want , Nicolas , I am a _RARE_ , you are a poet , it is all beautiful '' . STO
* To this _RARE_ _RARE_ Nicolas had replied , `` O.K. I can use this blanket . STO
* And when you get off this job tonight , well , you can _RARE_ something to eat '' . STO
* And , as a matter of fact , Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night , when he discovered that _RARE_ early mornings even in summer are laden with _RARE_ . STO
* He had always known how to find a bed , and on his own terms . STO
* He used the blanket for late morning _RARE_ when _RARE_ of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions . STO
* Mary Jane _RARE_ knew none of this . STO
* ) Her Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a _RARE_ , black hair falling over his eyes . STO
* She was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth . STO
* This was surely a _RARE_ in art , it was all that poetry promised . STO
* That long night with Nicolas and _RARE_ in _RARE_ had opened her eyes . STO
* His advice , his voice saying his poems , the fact that he had not so much as touched her -- on the contrary , he had put his head back and she had _RARE_ his hair -- this was all new . STO
* Her eyes had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith . STO
* The next day he was gone . STO
* Mary Jane might not be the most intelligent woman , but she was one of the most determined . STO
* Even so , it took her several days to force Walter to tell her _RARE_ whereabouts . STO
* _RARE_ a small suitcase , _RARE_ her husband whom she found in _RARE_ Bar that she was taking a train to Germany to get away for a while , _RARE_ his arm , refusing a drink , getting on the train -- all this had only taken her two hours . STO
* She had arrived this morning and come straight to the English Gardens . STO
* `` _RARE_ girl '' , Walter had finally said , `` he _RARE_ me that he is sleeping in the English Gardens '' . STO
* `` How like him '' ! STO
* Mary Jane had _RARE_ said . STO
* `` His address '' , Walter added , `` is that great _RARE_ home , the American _RARE_ . STO
* And I will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband . STO
* '' For the last half hour Mary Jane had _RARE_ half the length of the Gardens and , at last , come upon her _RARE_ . STO
* His presence there , asleep in the grass , confirmed all that Mary Jane believed it was in his power to teach her : freedom from the _RARE_ of needs such as hotels , the meaning of nature , how to live , simply , with the angels . STO
* She set down her suitcase . STO
* Should she wake him ? STO
* No . STO
* _RARE_ , she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched . STO
* The sun grew hotter as it approached the _RARE_ . STO
* Nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ car . STO
* He began _RARE_ . STO
* In his dream he cried , `` _RARE_ down , for _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass . STO
* His nose was _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ . STO
* He blew his nose _RARE_ between his fingers . STO
* He _RARE_ . STO
* He half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then , more vigorously , between his legs . STO
* He _RARE_ , he stretched . STO
* Mary Jane got up , quietly , and walked away . STO
* _RARE_ minutes later she was at the desk of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , her tears dried , _RARE_ a hotel form and asking for a bath . STO
* Mary Jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and _RARE_ in all the major and minor cities . STO
* She had retreated to this world . STO
* The Grafin , who was _RARE_ by her , told her , `` Your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair . STO
* _RARE_ are very interesting . STO
* Nevertheless , there is no bath . STO
* But a young American has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once . STO
* And then we shall see . STO
* '' ( The Grafin was partial to the word shall . STO
* ) Meredith was _RARE_ when the Grafin knocked at his door and told him , `` She is a great beauty ! STO
* Shall we allow her not to have a bath ? STO
* Actually , she is a sad beauty , I believe . STO
* You shall see her at dinner '' . STO
* Rather _RARE_ he listened to the bath water running ; ; when it stopped he began _RARE_ typing , sitting up in a _RARE_ way . STO
* Before dinner , he shaved for the second time that day . STO
* A thing he did not like doing , generally . STO
* _RARE_ into the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan . STO
* He _RARE_ his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew _RARE_ of _RARE_ as he washed . STO
* In the small _RARE_ used as the _RARE_ dining room , Meredith sat down at his place and , as always , began _RARE_ the young _RARE_ . STO
* He was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets ( she also served as maid ) when he saw the Grafin followed by a _RARE_ blond girl approaching his table . STO
* It would be literary license calculated to _RARE_ life to say that he , oh , dropped his _RARE_ , so startled was he by Mary _RARE_ beauty . STO
* Yet he did drop his _RARE_ with the ordinary country girl as much in _RARE_ to the Grafin as _RARE_ that here , indeed , was something special . STO
* Mary Jane had made very little effort . STO
* Above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green _RARE_ sweater with , as he soon perceived , no _RARE_ beneath . STO
* Her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders . STO
* Perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day . STO
* She had touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip _RARE_ which made her lips _RARE_ but no _RARE_ than usual . STO
* The result was grace and _RARE_ . STO
* As she was rather tired this evening , her simple `` Thank you for the use of your bath '' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with _RARE_ of intelligence and control . STO
* Meredith began falling in love . STO
* _RARE_ : `` Only this morning '' ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ : `` Oh , I couldn't possibly eat all this '' ! STO
* ; ; _RARE_ : `` Then you were typing poems this afternoon '' ? STO
* ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ : `` If you think I would understand it '' ; ; a smile . STO
* `` What a beautiful room . STO
* Like as if it were built of books '' . STO
* Having opened the windows onto the _RARE_ , lit the fire , translated the _RARE_ , Meredith grinned and took down a little _RARE_ of books bound together in old _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ these he brought out a _RARE_ bottle and small gold _RARE_ glasses hidden inside it . STO
* `` I think the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the afternoon '' . STO
* `` Those sweet girls ? STO
* Oh you're _RARE_ . STO
* It _RARE_ a little like _RARE_ . STO
* What's its name ? STO
* _RARE_ '' She whispered _RARE_ to herself , several times , _RARE_ it . STO
* `` Would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself '' ? STO
* _RARE_ voice was always deep , with rough bass notes in it ; ; in reading , on _RARE_ , even in the large _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ Center nights , his voice was intimate , thoughtful , and a trifle shy . STO
* His new poem , a love poem , told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed . STO
* The husband points the steps out with his flashlight : `` Its white stare filling her pale eyes To the blind _RARE_ with appetite , _RARE_ her hands that _RARE_ my thighs And sent us from the table in surprise To let the dishes _RARE_ all night , '' ( Mary Jane asked herself if Meredith was _RARE_ at this line , or was it the fire ? STO
* ) But he read on . STO
* In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` In dull domestic _RARE_ I watch her staring face , still blind , _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ To dirty waters , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ below stairs , in her mind '' . STO
* Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words . STO
* `` Oh , it's that myth , about _RARE_ and What is her name ? STO
* I can never _RARE_ it '' . STO
* She repeated `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* The third time rather _RARE_ . STO
* But with her hand poem again . STO
* She raised her face and nodded , `` It's sweet , and very sad '' . STO
* They discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds . STO
* They finished the small bottle of _RARE_ . STO
* She _RARE_ she was unhappy , he asked was it her husband ? STO
* She began to explain , `` There was this poet , in Italy '' He interrupted , `` Please don't judge all poets '' . STO
* They smiled . STO
* At her door , two or three hours later , Mary Jane whispered , `` Everyone is asleep '' . STO
* _RARE_ her he whispered , several times , `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* The third time rather _RARE_ . STO
* But with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment , she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited , _RARE_ , and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth . STO
* They were west of the _RARE_ , but only God knew where . STO
* For three days , their _RARE_ oxen had _RARE_ up a _RARE_ valley as flat and _RARE_ as a dead sea . STO
* _RARE_ glare _RARE_ their eyelids an angry _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ air _RARE_ their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ; dust _RARE_ their _RARE_ and lay like acid in their lungs . STO
* And the valley stretched _RARE_ out ahead , _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ in its heat , until it vanished into the _RARE_ wall of _RARE_ orange brown haze . STO
* Ben _RARE_ extended his _RARE_ stride until he could lay his _RARE_ across the _RARE_ of the oxen . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips . STO
* He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut _RARE_ through the dust film upon his _RARE_ face . STO
* He spat . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ came from his mouth like _RARE_ cotton . STO
* He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing , _RARE_ the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The burning air dried his _RARE_ clothes in _RARE_ patches . STO
* He cleared his throat and wet his lips . STO
* As _RARE_ as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink '' . STO
* He _RARE_ the dipper and drew water from a barrel . STO
* They could no longer afford the _RARE_ of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by _RARE_ . STO
* The water was warm and _RARE_ and had a _RARE_ taste . STO
* But it was water . STO
* Thank the Lord , they still had water ! STO
* He _RARE_ his mouth with a small quantity . STO
* He took a long but carefully controlled _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck . STO
* She took it grudgingly , her dark eyes _RARE_ as they met his . STO
* She drank and pushed back her _RARE_ _RARE_ to wet a _RARE_ and wipe her face . STO
* She set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on _RARE_ . STO
* `` What happens when there's no more water '' ? STO
* She asked _RARE_ . STO
* She was like charcoal , he thought -- dark , _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal . STO
* Her _RARE_ _RARE_ like charcoal when it first lights up . STO
* And all the time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under side , but not _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice . STO
* `` There must be some water under there '' . STO
* He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river . STO
* `` We can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently . STO
* `` And add fever to our troubles '' ? STO
* She _RARE_ . STO
* `` Or do you want to see if I can stand fever , too '' ? STO
* `` We can boil it '' , he said . STO
* Her chin _RARE_ . STO
* `` We're lost and burning up already '' , she bit out _RARE_ . STO
* `` The tires are rattling on the wheels now . STO
* They'll roll off in another day . STO
* There was no valley like this on your _RARE_ . STO
* You don't even know where we're headed '' . STO
* `` Hettie '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we're still headed west . STO
* Somewhere , we'll hit a trail '' . STO
* `` Somewhere ! STO
* '' She repeated . STO
* `` Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves '' . STO
* His wide mouth compressed . STO
* In a way , he couldn't blame her . STO
* He had picked out this _RARE_ trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their _RARE_ . STO
* It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out . STO
* It wasn't the _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the trip that had frightened her . STO
* She had hated the whole idea before they started . STO
* Actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him . STO
* It had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a _RARE_ of _RARE_ , administered by her mother . STO
* The bitterness of their wedding night still _RARE_ within him like an open wound . STO
* She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a _RARE_ . STO
* He had left her _RARE_ , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time . STO
* But each mile _RARE_ , she had hated him the deeper . STO
* He stared at the dipper , turning it over and over in his wide , _RARE_ hands . STO
* `` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' . STO
* `` Don't try to be noble '' ! STO
* Her laugh was hard . STO
* `` They wouldn't have sold me in the first place if _RARE_ been food enough to go around '' . STO
* He _RARE_ . STO
* `` Hettie , they didn't sell you '' , he said _RARE_ . STO
* `` They knew I was a good _RARE_ farmer back in _RARE_ , but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own . STO
* They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them . STO
* Without money or property , what would you have had at _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` I might have _RARE_ , but at least I wouldn't be _RARE_ to a crisp and soaked with dirt '' ! STO
* He darkened under his heavy burn . STO
* His blue eyes sought the _RARE_ sea of haze ahead . STO
* To his _RARE_ , there suddenly was no haze . STO
* The valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the _RARE_ line of _RARE_ , _RARE_ hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead . STO
* Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , _RARE_ clouds that formed even as they _RARE_ over the _RARE_ of the surrounding hills . STO
* He had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ on '' ! STO
* And _RARE_ the oxen as he yelled . STO
* He wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm . STO
* Too late , he realized that in turning , he had _RARE_ them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of _RARE_ a grade or ridge . STO
* He swung up over the wheel . STO
* `` You had better get inside '' , he warned her . STO
* But she sat on in stubborn silence . STO
* The clouds _RARE_ downward and burst suddenly into a great black _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , they stared at it whirling down the valley , _RARE_ and _RARE_ out _RARE_ and _RARE_ of earth like a _RARE_ _RARE_ dog cracking _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ began to whip and shake . STO
* Their world turned black . STO
* It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence . STO
* The _RARE_ opened , _RARE_ them with _RARE_ the size of _RARE_ . STO
* And then came the water -- not rain , but solid sheets that _RARE_ down like water _RARE_ from a bucket . STO
* _RARE_ of water rushed down the _RARE_ and filled the _RARE_ like the _RARE_ of flash _RARE_ . STO
* Through the _RARE_ of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , _RARE_ big _RARE_ out of the banks . STO
* The _RARE_ , _RARE_ surface of the river reached the level of the _RARE_ . STO
* The dangerous current upon the _RARE_ _RARE_ , but the water stood and kept on rising . STO
* They _RARE_ under _RARE_ covers , listening to the waves _RARE_ against the bottom . STO
* The _RARE_ cut off abruptly . STO
* They were _RARE_ by the _RARE_ silence , broken only by the low , angry _RARE_ of the river . STO
* Then the darkness _RARE_ , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight . STO
* _RARE_ with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out _RARE_ at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills . STO
* The water level was higher than their _RARE_ . STO
* Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored . STO
* There was no real sign of the river now , just a _RARE_ , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere . STO
* _RARE_ of brush rode down the ribbon . STO
* Now and then , the glistening side of a _RARE_ object showed as it swept past . STO
* The girl crawled out into the _RARE_ warmth of the _RARE_ , hugging her shoulders and still trembling . STO
* Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes _RARE_ with blame for Ben . STO
* Out of _RARE_ to say something _RARE_ , Ben _RARE_ _RARE_ , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first _RARE_ hit . STO
* At least , the wheels dug in . STO
* The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' . STO
* His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard . STO
* She was watching a tree ride wildly down that _RARE_ current . STO
* Somebody was riding the tree . STO
* It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting _RARE_ an upright branch . STO
* She did not call out . STO
* But as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell . STO
* They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend . STO
* It _RARE_ up into the air , then _RARE_ back , the _RARE_ branch turned slowly . STO
* The pale _RARE_ of the woman disappeared . STO
* `` There's the one who's lucky '' ! STO
* The girl murmured _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and _RARE_ . STO
* Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the _RARE_ , needing their comfort more than they needed his . STO
* It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , _RARE_ his way , for he was not a tall man . STO
* He let down the _RARE_ and was knocked over by the _RARE_ of water . STO
* He _RARE_ back to his feet and scrambled _RARE_ to pull his bags of seed grain forward . STO
* They were already swollen to bursting . STO
* Of all their _RARE_ _RARE_ , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most _RARE_ . STO
* It was spoiled now for seed , and it would _RARE_ and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it . STO
* The oxen might as well enjoy it . STO
* He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished . STO
* The waters lay muddy but _RARE_ , without a _RARE_ of movement against the wheels ; ; there was not a _RARE_ of damp mark to show they were _RARE_ . STO
* He doubted if a man could _RARE_ as far as the _RARE_ , dry hills that _RARE_ the valley . STO
* A terrible , _RARE_ sense of _RARE_ swept over him . STO
* He gripped the wheel hard to fight the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen . STO
* The _RARE_ were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece . STO
* Hope surged within him . STO
* He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie , then stopped , _RARE_ from her by the _RARE_ of her blame and hate . STO
* Still , he felt better . STO
* A tight wagon meant so much . STO
* He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee . STO
* He poured the water off the _RARE_ and off the _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ for biscuits of a sort . STO
* Their _RARE_ and _RARE_ had not suffered . STO
* He found a jar of preserved _RARE_ and one of eggs that they had meant to save . STO
* Now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might _RARE_ this depression _RARE_ Hettie . STO
* His long nose _RARE_ at the _RARE_ of _RARE_ bacon and heating _RARE_ , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time . STO
* He _RARE_ the slashed sides of the canvas _RARE_ , leaving the ribs and wagon open . STO
* He looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk , holding her _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He said _RARE_ , `` Hettie , I don't figure your things got wet too much . STO
* That's a good trunk . STO
* If you want to get them _RARE_ '' She said without turning her head , `` After that rain beating in _RARE_ the dust , there isn't a thing that won't be _RARE_ '' . STO
* He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and _RARE_ upon the wagon ribs . STO
* _RARE_ , oil , and _RARE_ make the kind of _RARE_ any _RARE_ dreams of . STO
* I suppose a _RARE_ _RARE_ had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the _RARE_ . STO
* Now , _RARE_ up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the _RARE_ heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like _RARE_ sheep , not knowing what to do . STO
* The _RARE_ were stuck fast . STO
* We couldn't _RARE_ them . STO
* I heard a cry from a _RARE_ as a _RARE_ of flame leaped from a hatch and _RARE_ the man's bare back . STO
* He _RARE_ to the rail and leaped _RARE_ into the _RARE_ waters . STO
* One especially bad _RARE_ shook _RARE_ No. 3 which trembled violently in the _RARE_ . STO
* Brassnose yelled : `` Come on , _RARE_ , Max step on it , we got a chance now . STO
* _RARE_ on those _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ come _RARE_ '' . STO
* We pulled and swore and yanked and wept , scraping our hands until they _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ was quivering and _RARE_ like an old _RARE_ mare . STO
* Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the _RARE_ which dropped heavily into the water . STO
* Brassnose , Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat . STO
* `` Let's get away fast '' , said Brassnose , shaking water from his _RARE_ of bleached hair . STO
* `` That tub is going to _RARE_ all at once '' . STO
* Then the _RARE_ seemed to _RARE_ with a roar of live steam , _RARE_ of _RARE_ and flames , and a dense cloud of _RARE_ smoke . STO
* _RARE_ , we heard the voices of men in _RARE_ agony but we couldn't go back into that _RARE_ . STO
* Already our _RARE_ _RARE_ was filled with five inches of water . STO
* `` _RARE_ , you bale while we row '' , Brassnose commanded . STO
* As best as I could determine , we were some _RARE_ miles west of New _RARE_ , in the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Three days previously , we had _RARE_ past barren _RARE_ Island in the distance . STO
* Now we peered anxiously for any _RARE_ of land in the Pacific , for this _RARE_ _RARE_ would have to stop soon . STO
* There were gigantic _RARE_ and rope _RARE_ on our hands ; ; our muscles were hot wires of pain . STO
* Brassnose was _RARE_ silent . STO
* The big man with the _RARE_ hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue , which I recognized , having studied the dialect in my _RARE_ 6 , class at the University of Chicago . STO
* He then said something which struck a chord in my memory . STO
* `` God help us if we're near the island of Eromonga . STO
* We'd be in real trouble then . STO
* I'd rather keep _RARE_ -- or sink '' . STO
* I was puzzled by the remark , then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard _RARE_ three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies . STO
* He had been speaking of this _RARE_ : `` Even when the _RARE_ were under German _RARE_ before World War 1 , , _RARE_ gave Eromonga a wide _RARE_ . STO
* The place is _RARE_ by several hundred _RARE_ women who are _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ -- stone age _RARE_ who live in an _RARE_ , _RARE_ society which is _RARE_ '' . STO
* I remembered , too , the _RARE_ voice of a _RARE_ , Bobby _RARE_ : `` But how do they _RARE_ , Dr. _RARE_ ? STO
* I'm sure that males have something to do with that process '' ! STO
* There had been classroom _RARE_ which quickly _RARE_ as Professor _RARE_ said _RARE_ : `` I see your point , _RARE_ . STO
* Of course , males play a role there , but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga . STO
* Indeed , you wouldn't live long , for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring _RARE_ back to their boats after _RARE_ them for _RARE_ purposes , or they destroy them by _RARE_ but ingenious methods . STO
* In fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the _RARE_ of men '' . STO
* `` I think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said . STO
* `` I know something about Eromonga . STO
* Let's hope we come to a _RARE_ place '' . STO
* But we didn't . STO
* Three hours later , while we were _RARE_ desperately , a dot of land came into view . STO
* Foster _RARE_ _RARE_ made a sign over his heart with his two linked _RARE_ : I recognized it as an ancient Manu gesture intended to _RARE_ the _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ passed ; ; we had drifted closer . STO
* In a voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big _RARE_ mate _RARE_ : `` _RARE_ ! STO
* It is Eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden _RARE_ on the cliff '' . STO
* I _RARE_ at the looming _RARE_ . STO
* There was a wooden tower or _RARE_ there , something like a _RARE_ jump ; ; it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been _RARE_ constructed of _RARE_ . STO
* A fine example of engineering in a primitive society . STO
* `` What is the _RARE_ for , Brassnose '' ? STO
* He made a sound of despair deep in his throat . STO
* It was _RARE_ to see _RARE_ , blonde Brassnose _RARE_ himself like a child who _RARE_ about _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ ! STO
* It is their _RARE_ , the ' jumping platform ' of death . STO
* It is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women _RARE_ , to discover if a male is worthy of survival there . STO
* Often , I heard my _RARE_ and cousins speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in _RARE_ . STO
* They had never seen a _RARE_ but they had heard about it from their _RARE_ '' . STO
* Our _RARE_ was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga , I was glad to see a long and _RARE_ _RARE_ manned by three _RARE_ girls _RARE_ out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft . STO
* I expected Brassnose -- as a man with a strain of _RARE_ in his blood -- to speak to them . STO
* But he had turned a _RARE_ green and appeared _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* So , I _RARE_ my few words of the Manu dialect and said , `` We _RARE_ you in peace . STO
* In _RARE_ . STO
* My friends and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire . STO
* We are _RARE_ and hungry ; ; our sore and burned hands and arms need attention '' . STO
* The girl in the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ turned a smile like a _RARE_ on me . STO
* I noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a _RARE_ of red _RARE_ fruit in her _RARE_ hair . STO
* She said , `` My name is _RARE_ and these girls are _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* You are welcome to Eromonga . STO
* My people await you on the shore . STO
* You shall have food , water and rest '' . STO
* _RARE_ minutes later , the _RARE_ _RARE_ on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with _RARE_ _RARE_ to a large _RARE_ . STO
* I saw a dozen or so other _RARE_ _RARE_ there . STO
* I looked . STO
* All my _RARE_ _RARE_ of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight . STO
* There was a _RARE_ of bleached human bones and _RARE_ at the base of the big wooden _RARE_ . STO
* Some had been there for years ; ; others still had _RARE_ shreds of _RARE_ flesh sticking to them . STO
* There was one object which _RARE_ yet _RARE_ me . STO
* This was also a corpse -- a male , _RARE_ from the _RARE_ arm bands , the _RARE_ scars still discernible on the _RARE_ face , the painted bone of the warrior _RARE_ which still _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ nose . STO
* The body may have been two or three _RARE_ dead . STO
* I looked with _RARE_ at the legs . STO
* They were shattered . STO
* Many small bones _RARE_ _RARE_ from the shreds of flesh . STO
* The man must have leaped to his death from the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ . STO
* As if _RARE_ my thoughts , the girl _RARE_ smiled _RARE_ and said in the casual tone an American woman might use in _RARE_ her rose garden : `` This is our _RARE_ , a jumping platform , _RARE_ . STO
* Later , you shall know it better . STO
* Is it not _RARE_ ? STO
* Our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the _RARE_ _RARE_ fifteen _RARE_ ago . STO
* It took thirty of our women almost six _RARE_ to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one . STO
* We are very proud of it '' . STO
* `` You have every right to be '' , I replied _RARE_ in the Manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the _RARE_ and strongest of us . STO
* He looked as if he was going to _RARE_ over . STO
* I felt a _RARE_ in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid . STO
* Not so soon , anyway . STO
* I _RARE_ the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He speaks your language too , for he is the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ on _RARE_ who made much magic and was strong and _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ has inherited this strength from his _RARE_ '' . STO
* This was the worst thing I could have said . STO
* Brassnose turned a _RARE_ face toward me and said _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ , you _RARE_ _RARE_ , you're a fool ! STO
* They _RARE_ males who _RARE_ of their strength ; ; they destroy such men with their damned tests . STO
* You've ruined me , blast you '' ! STO
* At first , I thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this . STO
* But a glance at _RARE_ and the other women confirmed what Brassnose had _RARE_ out . STO
* The women's faces had _RARE_ after my statement . STO
* At a nod from _RARE_ , four _RARE_ and muscular girls darted to _RARE_ side and seized him by the arms . STO
* The man was an _RARE_ and he put up a _RARE_ struggle ; ; but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived . STO
* Besides , terror had _RARE_ some of _RARE_ _RARE_ and will . STO
* My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face . STO
* In the Manu tongue , `` _RARE_ '' means manhood -- a quality which the women _RARE_ _RARE_ in weekly _RARE_ at which great quantities of a _RARE_ like _RARE_ were _RARE_ . STO
* In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled _RARE_ with bare _RARE_ breasts who seemed to enjoy _RARE_ with me in _RARE_ phrases . STO
* Her name was _RARE_ and she told me many things . STO
* For an _RARE_ , _RARE_ old _RARE_ was a mine of information . STO
* Though I had a great _RARE_ of the island and felt I would never leave it alive , I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women . STO
* ( Her account was later confirmed by the _RARE_ _RARE_ from the University of _RARE_ in 1951 . STO
* ) From _RARE_ , I heard that until about _RARE_ the people of this island -- which was about the size of Guam or smaller -- had been of both sexes , and that the normal family life of _RARE_ _RARE_ was observed here with minor variations . STO
* But in the middle of the last century an island woman named `` _RARE_ '' seized a _RARE_ in the heat of an _RARE_ battle and _RARE_ the women after their men had fled . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred _RARE_ from the _RARE_ of _RARE_ back to their war _RARE_ , after considerable loss of life on both sides . STO
* _RARE_ was something of a politician as well as a _RARE_ . STO
* She quickly _RARE_ the _RARE_ position she now occupied , by _RARE_ the _RARE_ males and even putting many of them to death . STO
* Within a decade or less , few men were left and a _RARE_ society had sprung up . STO
* `` _RARE_ was great _RARE_ , told our _RARE_ that men were not necessary except to father children '' , the _RARE_ told me . STO
* `` All men went away from here . STO
* Those who stayed had to pass tests . STO
* Few passed '' . STO
* She _RARE_ with _RARE_ , showing the _RARE_ of _RARE_ teeth . STO
* `` _RARE_ women then named this place ' Eromonga ' -- manhood -- for just the strongest men could stay here . STO
* Come , I show you '' . STO
* The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood . STO
* In the shade of a _RARE_ tree in front of the _RARE_ dwelling I saw four figures in a _RARE_ on the ground . STO
* `` I guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home . STO
* Maybe to beat up on his _RARE_ '' . STO
* Benson looked up and saw _RARE_ long head _RARE_ forward to _RARE_ his chin on the stiff edge of the overall _RARE_ . STO
* Ramey reached out with the tire iron and _RARE_ a _RARE_ of mud that was _RARE_ on the spare tire rack . STO
* `` I'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand , the liquor or automobiles '' . STO
* Somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver . STO
* For a moment his hatred toward drunken or _RARE_ drivers _RARE_ . STO
* Maybe the Indian wasn't too much at fault , Ramey thought . STO
* Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us . STO
* Anyway , he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at . STO
* `` Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* He said to his partner . STO
* `` You mean dream '' ? STO
* `` Not exactly . STO
* Just see it '' . STO
* Benson grinned and _RARE_ a rock with his thumb like a marble . STO
* `` _RARE_ , just you , all the time -- sometimes I think it's the only way I'll ever get a decent partner '' . STO
* Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too . STO
* Never _RARE_ . STO
* Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind . STO
* Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think . STO
* With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down . STO
* `` You seen him yet '' ? STO
* Benson said , referring to the Indian . STO
* `` He wasn't in the car '' , Ramey said . STO
* `` You didn't go clear around '' , Benson said . STO
* `` If you want to see something , he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car '' . STO
* `` Too long a waiting line '' , Ramey answered , pretending to joke . STO
* A few minutes later the insurance man , a road _RARE_ , drove up in the gray _RARE_ with license plates on it from a _RARE_ state . STO
* It was a trick they used to try and _RARE_ their identity when they followed _RARE_ to check their speed . STO
* Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the _RARE_ as they passed . STO
* All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big _RARE_ straw hat with _RARE_ edges , the kind _RARE_ in travel ads wear when they are out _RARE_ _RARE_ cane . STO
* _RARE_ , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist . STO
* It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to _RARE_ himself as a tourist , an _RARE_ driver like _RARE_ would merely pick something _RARE_ and put it on his head . STO
* The insurance man informed them that he had talked to _RARE_ who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they _RARE_ the _RARE_ back to town . STO
* He _RARE_ with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the _RARE_ shade of the trailer . STO
* Every so often the _RARE_ sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then _RARE_ up again as it got clear . STO
* When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer . STO
* `` There's a body you won't mind looking at '' , Benson said and they stopped . STO
* She had driven up with her husband in a _RARE_ with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that . STO
* She wore shorts and a loose _RARE_ shirt . STO
* _RARE_ and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply . STO
* `` What outfit does she drive for '' ? STO
* Benson said . STO
* Seeing her caused a _RARE_ in Ramey , a recognition . STO
* She might have been someone he had once loved . STO
* He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run . STO
* The truck _RARE_ , the industrial areas with walls _RARE_ with _RARE_ smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back _RARE_ were their access to a city and they could never stay . STO
* How would you ever see her again ? STO
* The feeling _RARE_ , it was only a small _RARE_ . STO
* Their work was lonely . STO
* `` What's she doing in this bunch '' ? STO
* Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been . STO
* The girl looked around at the _RARE_ . STO
* Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing . STO
* It made only a tiny _RARE_ over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on . STO
* She began to watch a _RARE_ man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the _RARE_ car in the one spot that most of the crowd had _RARE_ slightly . STO
* What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was . STO
* The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that barefoot _RARE_ Ramey could never decide was real , said , `` You don't want to go around there , _RARE_ '' . STO
* The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her . STO
* The man stood near the bent _RARE_ body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car . STO
* The two drivers moved closer . STO
* `` What does he want , a _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Benson said to Ramey . STO
* One tiny detail in a happening can _RARE_ the memory and stick like meat in a _RARE_ tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go _RARE_ and uncertain . STO
* With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was _RARE_ the Indian's foot that he would always remember . STO
* The _RARE_ were broken at the bottom of the _RARE_ but there was still a bow knot at the top . STO
* The slightest _RARE_ would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside . STO
* The two men in overalls stood just behind the _RARE_ man . STO
* He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the _RARE_ . STO
* He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , _RARE_ eyes . STO
* He was very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` He's dead , isn't he '' ? STO
* The man said . STO
* He turned and bent over the body of the Indian . STO
* There was nothing in particular on the man's face . STO
* It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine . STO
* `` What's this '' ? STO
* The man said , backing up a step , still looking down . STO
* His words were mostly to himself . STO
* `` Don't '' . STO
* There was a gentle concern in _RARE_ voice . STO
* Ramey looked down and saw the white _RARE_ at the bottom of the man's tanned leg _RARE_ _RARE_ a bit of folded , _RARE_ substance lying by itself on the pavement . STO
* `` But what is it '' ? STO
* The man said with a tone of impatience . STO
* But what is it ? STO
* The man had spoken only once . STO
* Ramey heard the words again inside , _RARE_ , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or _RARE_ pressing in his ears . STO
* The _RARE_ reached out once more to tap against the mass and _RARE_ vision darkened except for an _RARE_ clarity of the man's leg . STO
* Ramey saw sunlight touch the _RARE_ blonde hairs on the brown skin . STO
* He stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , `` Don't do that , _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ brains '' . STO
* The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist . STO
* Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth . STO
* It was a straight , solid , _RARE_ shot ; ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man's _RARE_ and his chin . STO
* _RARE_ fist and the air _RARE_ from the man's _RARE_ cheek made a hollow _RARE_ in the air like _RARE_ hands clapping together . STO
* The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement . STO
* Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand . STO
* As he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet . STO
* He hadn't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard . STO
* With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him . STO
* His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open . STO
* After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to _RARE_ from it . STO
* The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth . STO
* He _RARE_ and pulled the hand away . STO
* Even yet there was no realization in his eyes . STO
* Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him . STO
* He did not look around . STO
* `` What happened '' ? STO
* Someone said . STO
* `` He's hurt '' ! STO
* A woman's voice said , and then he heard a sort of _RARE_ from the man's wife . STO
* The man on the ground began to move ; ; one of his hands _RARE_ out on the pavement and supported him . STO
* Blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran _RARE_ across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V _RARE_ into the _RARE_ had _RARE_ , running a _RARE_ color . STO
* The girl _RARE_ by her husband with one arm at his back . STO
* `` Can you hear , can you talk to me '' ? STO
* She begged . STO
* An _RARE_ , puzzled sound came from the red mouth . STO
* The girl looked around quickly at several of the people . STO
* None of the crowd had stepped forward to help . STO
* Then she saw Ramey and her face was _RARE_ with _RARE_ . STO
* `` Why did you do it -- why did you hit him '' ? STO
* She said , her voice rising . STO
* Ramey said nothing . STO
* A _RARE_ in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again . STO
* Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning _RARE_ . STO
* No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out . STO
* Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the _RARE_ truck talking to the patrolman . STO
* Benson moved his arms , _RARE_ with an unfamiliar _RARE_ and talking rapidly . STO
* Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man . STO
* Some of the _RARE_ was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey . STO
* It's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them . STO
* Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer . STO
* He saw the dark sweat spots _RARE_ in and out of sight under the _RARE_ swinging arms and in the leather holster that _RARE_ and rolled at the side of his _RARE_ body , the sun left a _RARE_ _RARE_ on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the _RARE_ _RARE_ of his pistol . STO
* `` All right , step back '' ! STO
* The patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in _RARE_ . STO
* He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him . STO
* `` You all right '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ -- it's my _RARE_ '' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips . STO
* His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it . STO
* Then he calmly and carefully _RARE_ the remaining five shots into the _RARE_ head -- caught in the _RARE_ back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the _RARE_ . STO
* The body continued to _RARE_ , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the _RARE_ , bloody mass out of the _RARE_ . STO
* He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots . STO
* He heard their chattering , and then the sounds of _RARE_ as they _RARE_ the snake right on the porch with wood axes . STO
* It was only then that he turned to look at Penny . STO
* She was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her . STO
* The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , _RARE_ into her eyes and the lines of her mouth . STO
* But her hands were calm , now . STO
* She's got guts , thought Keith . STO
* She's got more guts than any other woman in the world . STO
* `` Keith '' , said Penny , `` Keith , you were wonderful . STO
* I don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am . STO
* Thank you , Keith '' . STO
* He smiled at her _RARE_ . STO
* And for the _RARE_ time that week , he was startled at her beauty . STO
* Strange . STO
* Seven years they'd been married . STO
* He knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick _RARE_ and _RARE_ , its painful insistence on truth and _RARE_ , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to _RARE_ , even in part . STO
* But her beauty always surprised him _RARE_ . STO
* `` I realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny '' , said Keith . STO
* `` But knowing you , I know that you're glad to be alive , and grateful -- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to . STO
* Isn't that so '' ? STO
* Penny lowered her eyes . STO
* `` Yes '' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if _RARE_ to a crime . STO
* `` The snake was beautiful , wasn't it '' ? STO
* Asked Keith , his voice getting _RARE_ in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger . STO
* `` It was a king _RARE_ , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn't it ? STO
* didn't it ? STO
* '' Penny did not answer . STO
* Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him . STO
* `` We're all God's creatures , aren't we '' ? STO
* Keith was _RARE_ now . STO
* `` All of us -- every _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ and killer in that jungle . STO
* You love this village and these _RARE_ brown people because they're God's creatures , too . STO
* And you love _RARE_ , that black bastard of a _RARE_ even a little more , because he's a beautiful man . STO
* And he loves you because you're a beautiful woman . STO
* We're all God's creatures , aren't we , Penny ? STO
* All of us , that is , except me . STO
* You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to _RARE_ . STO
* You actually hate me -- and we both know it -- because I killed that filthy snake . STO
* Well , why don't you say something '' ? STO
* Penny would not rise to his mood . STO
* `` There isn't anything left to say , is there , Keith '' ? STO
* She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the _RARE_ . STO
* He knew she was not _RARE_ , not even angry at him . STO
* Just as he knew that she had stopped _RARE_ him . STO
* The _RARE_ has its _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of the world , the towering white _RARE_ of the _RARE_ that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet . STO
* For a brief period each year , the _RARE_ of the sun are warm enough to _RARE_ some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the _RARE_ , and then the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the daytime at high noon , and _RARE_ of _RARE_ of water begin their slow _RARE_ under the _RARE_ and across the _RARE_ hanging _RARE_ on their long , _RARE_ journey to the sea -- running east past the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , then turning south and _RARE_ down through the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , past the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and into _RARE_ , past _RARE_ and _RARE_ , until the hard water of the melting snows _RARE_ with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to _RARE_ with the _RARE_ salt depths of the Bay of _RARE_ . STO
* Keith _RARE_ had looked down on the _RARE_ more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the _RARE_ of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space . STO
* But Keith looked down more than up . STO
* He thought of the _RARE_ below him , and of the wild , strange , _RARE_ beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to _RARE_ in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the _RARE_ . STO
* At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of _RARE_ _RARE_ after the war . STO
* But `` after the war '' was a _RARE_ of a phrase he did not permit himself . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves . STO
* And _RARE_ record of _RARE_ made him a man to listen to -- a man _RARE_ , who might even survive . STO
* He became a _RARE_ pilot after the _RARE_ over the _RARE_ in the big _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ was _RARE_ weapon of _RARE_ , and flying a _RARE_ plane was the way her _RARE_ could serve her best at this point in the war . STO
* He knew how to shoot down Nazis . STO
* And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the _RARE_ on it -- because he was _RARE_ _RARE_ of fear . STO
* That was true , but only half the truth . STO
* The other half he didn't like to recognize , even to himself . STO
* He enjoyed the killing . STO
* Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity . STO
* He enjoyed killing . STO
* And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , we talk as though the _RARE_ were just a short _RARE_ . STO
* The Nazis _RARE_ Britain , so the _RARE_ _RARE_ and shot them all down . STO
* Not quite . STO
* It was a war of nerves , of _RARE_ , of _RARE_ _RARE_ in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an _RARE_ obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and _RARE_ superior . STO
* It took a long time before the British _RARE_ the balance . STO
* Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be _RARE_ . STO
* They _RARE_ him ( over his _RARE_ -- not including his true reason for wanting to fly ) and put him in the Command offices . STO
* That was where he met Penny . STO
* He was aware of her as a _RARE_ _RARE_ American _RARE_ , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , ( regardless of how important she might have thought she was ) in the Command offices , but that was all . STO
* Penny knew him better , on her part . STO
* He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without _RARE_ . STO
* They don't go for _RARE_ muscle , as a rule . STO
* He had strength in his _RARE_ frame , but it was like the _RARE_ steel in a _RARE_ . STO
* He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* His hair was black , already _RARE_ at the _RARE_ in the classic _RARE_ , the only one permitted to a man . STO
* The pretty little _RARE_ _RARE_ said he had the look of _RARE_ -- and Penny , _RARE_ the _RARE_ , had to admit that in this case it applied . STO
* Keith was an _RARE_ . STO
* Penny and Keith had no romance . STO
* No dates or _RARE_ . STO
* But they met in one _RARE_ moment that gave them to one another instantly . STO
* The Command offices were in the _RARE_ country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the _RARE_ were _RARE_ to _RARE_ the enemy . STO
* The Nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit . STO
* This time , they had been lucky . STO
* The Command post was underground , and well _RARE_ . STO
* But there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps . STO
* There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as _RARE_ , when a direct hit comes along . STO
* This one was actually more of a `` near miss '' . STO
* The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself . STO
* There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to _RARE_ , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the _RARE_ as _RARE_ , as ordered . STO
* That is , everyone but Keith and Penny . STO
* They stood there , just the two of them , in the _RARE_ , shattering blast . STO
* Keith was on his feet because he didn't care at all about life any more : Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much . STO
* The bomb was a solitary one . STO
* The blast _RARE_ , but did not destroy the room . STO
* _RARE_ eyes met _RARE_ as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction . STO
* And , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the _RARE_ and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his . STO
* The _RARE_ married them , on the next day . STO
* After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her . STO
* She came from Ohio , from what she called a `` small farm '' of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But to _RARE_ _RARE_ mind , such _RARE_ sounded rather _RARE_ . STO
* It wasn't that , however , which decided them not to go to America . STO
* Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and _RARE_ . STO
* He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the _RARE_ . STO
* He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself . STO
* He couldn't stop killing . STO
* That was his true love , not Penny . STO
* The terrible power of a gun , the thing that _RARE_ the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose . STO
* And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing . STO
* When they got to _RARE_ , in _RARE_ , he was happy . STO
* This is a _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* This was the land of the _RARE_ , the great water _RARE_ with _RARE_ forty inches across the spread . STO
* The great black _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He even hunted _RARE_ , although the _RARE_ _RARE_ is not quite as _RARE_ as his African cousin . STO
* But there are big _RARE_ in both countries . STO
* These were the ones Keith sought out -- the _RARE_ , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself . STO
* He and Penny would go out on _RARE_ _RARE_ , raised from _RARE_ in the _RARE_ . STO
* And while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a _RARE_ , Penny _RARE_ at the _RARE_ they were _RARE_ . STO
* They came upon _RARE_ _RARE_ at _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ across their path , _RARE_ . STO
* There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and _RARE_ birds without song . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ played around the feet of the _RARE_ , or fled when the mighty legs _RARE_ too close . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted _RARE_ when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the . STO
* Now , the next morning , they were anchored at The _RARE_ and the boat was riding directly over the _RARE_ _RARE_ where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down _RARE_ _RARE_ , with the _RARE_ line beside it ; ; and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface . STO
* He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the _RARE_ ladder together . STO
* The German _RARE_ indicated that Robinson should mount first . STO
* Robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his _RARE_ assembly . STO
* He was frowning . STO
* He took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , laughing _RARE_ . STO
* A phony blonde hanging onto a _RARE_ youth and beauty , but _RARE_ _RARE_ in the neck , she was already working on her second _RARE_ and _RARE_ , though it was not yet ten A.M. `` I _RARE_ it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice . STO
* `` All I have to do to set the record is to go on down . STO
* So instead I come up '' . STO
* `` Was it my equipment '' ? STO
* The German asked . STO
* `` Was it something went bad with the breathing '' ? STO
* `` The equipment was fine '' , Rob stated , standing up . STO
* He was a huge young man of _RARE_ , _RARE_ in muscle , immensely strong , with a _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ of manner that was _RARE_ under his present _RARE_ . STO
* He stared _RARE_ at the floor . STO
* `` I was down to _RARE_ . STO
* I've been that far half a dozen times . STO
* I don't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick '' . STO
* `` Well , I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder . STO
* `` You are a big _RARE_ _RARE_ and you got this idea about setting a record . STO
* And you also got this little _RARE_ in your _RARE_ that tells you to turn around before you _RARE_ yourself . STO
* So you turn around '' . STO
* `` No , it wasn't that '' , Rob said . STO
* A note of _RARE_ came into his voice . STO
* `` When I came up , _RARE_ , I thought I was going down . STO
* I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Artie said , and climbed in . STO
* `` That's right '' , Robinson said . STO
* `` I was expecting it , sure . STO
* But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think . STO
* You don't head back down again . STO
* Not me , anyway . STO
* Not right away '' . STO
* He had his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was _RARE_ by what had just happened to him . STO
* Waddell , the _RARE_ , was a fellow in his middle _RARE_ , with a _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ glasses , and a large jaw _RARE_ with fat . STO
* Now he was going to show how much he knew . STO
* `` Our boy didn't chicken out , no sir . STO
* He ran into the _RARE_ of the depths . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It makes the _RARE_ feel drunk '' . STO
* `` Well , that's the only way to be '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , and gave her _RARE_ laugh . STO
* `` Maybe not , if you're 200 feet under water '' , Artie said . STO
* `` Anyway '' , Waddell went on . STO
* `` It's nothing to fool with . STO
* It can kill you . STO
* _RARE_ , I don't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ giving anything up '' , Robinson said . STO
* He stood there , towering over them all : gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; ; and yet like a child among adults . STO
* `` You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ? STO
* I'm going down again '' . STO
* `` That's my boy '' ! STO
* Mr. Forsythe exclaimed . STO
* `` _RARE_ not going to give up as easy as all that '' . STO
* He was a _RARE_ , _RARE_ man in his early _RARE_ , very _RARE_ in his _RARE_ cap , striped jacket and white _RARE_ . STO
* He went to _RARE_ West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` _RARE_ '' was never used without irony . STO
* Old _RARE_ Forsythe , who had once lost a _RARE_ bet on whether he could get both _RARE_ started and turn on the running lights without _RARE_ turning on something else first . STO
* Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again : Rob was his boy , the kid he had _RARE_ from the streets , the object of his pride . STO
* `` Why '' , he went on , `` when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I didn't think twice about it . STO
* I've helped him along ever since he was a _RARE_ hanging around his brother's _RARE_ shop . STO
* Hell , I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven -- how many years ago was it , Rob '' ? STO
* `` Seven years ago , _RARE_ '' , Rob said _RARE_ . STO
* He was thinking , big deal : _RARE_ on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started . STO
* `` _RARE_ me '' , he said abruptly . STO
* He went down the steps to the _RARE_ and sleeping quarters ; ; went into the forward _RARE_ and locked the door behind him . STO
* `` When you _RARE_ go , you _RARE_ go '' , Mrs. Forsythe said . STO
* Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge . STO
* He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said . STO
* `` Can I make you one '' ? STO
* `` No thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his _RARE_ English . STO
* `` I do not drink so much , thank you '' . STO
* Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up . STO
* He was in his early _RARE_ , rather short and very _RARE_ built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to _RARE_ himself to American ways . STO
* His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence . STO
* Waddell had heard that he had been a _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ Corps , and he said to himself : I'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night . STO
* _RARE_ he had said , making conversation : `` Rob tells me he's using your _RARE_ equipment on the dive '' . STO
* `` Yes '' , Herr Schaffner had said . STO
* `` He's one hell of a decent boy . STO
* I like that kid '' . STO
* `` I agree , yes '' . STO
* `` And if the dive goes _RARE_ he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? STO
* `` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said . STO
* Waddell turned to face him . STO
* `` No '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` But that's what he told me . STO
* Why , that's his main reason for making the dive '' . STO
* _RARE_ looked at him , altogether without _RARE_ , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands . STO
* `` What do you mean '' ? STO
* Waddell asked , frowning . STO
* `` Please let me explain '' , the German said earnestly , his face still _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* `` I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year . STO
* Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong . STO
* I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to _RARE_ my products . STO
* With all respect to a fine young man , Mr. Roy is not able to provide these _RARE_ '' . STO
* Waddell was not an _RARE_ moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard . STO
* `` Did you tell him all this '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` Perhaps not in so many words '' , the German said . STO
* `` But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy . STO
* Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights . STO
* We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity . STO
* He was most eager to make the dive ; ; of course , I was willing . STO
* But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements '' . STO
* `` Well , damn '' , Waddell said . STO
* There was the end of his _RARE_ feature story , with _RARE_ . STO
* He started out the door . STO
* `` One moment '' ! STO
* Herr Schaffner said . STO
* `` You _RARE_ to speak with Mr. Roy '' ? STO
* `` What else '' ? STO
* Waddell asked . STO
* `` If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not . STO
* Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive . STO
* Whatever you tell him he will dive . STO
* I know this from my _RARE_ with him '' . STO
* `` Well , let's let him make up his own mind , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Waddell said . STO
* `` On the basis of the facts '' . STO
* `` You will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said . STO
* `` At 200 , 300 , _RARE_ feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him . STO
* It is not good , Mr. Waddell : you will do him great harm '' . STO
* There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said . STO
* Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk . STO
* `` I am an honest man '' , the German said with _RARE_ . STO
* `` I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive . STO
* I will make him _RARE_ for all of Florida -- a big market . STO
* All tourists come to Florida . STO
* This will help him to get out of his little _RARE_ shop . STO
* Yes ! STO
* But there is no use causing him to worry at this time '' . STO
* The _RARE_ words worked on the _RARE_ like a _RARE_ from an _RARE_ duty . STO
* He took a big _RARE_ of his drink . STO
* It would be a _RARE_ shame to throw away a story like this . STO
* `` I think maybe you're right , Schaffner '' , he said . STO
* `` He has the _RARE_ for Florida , you say '' ? STO
* `` Yes '' , the German said . STO
* `` At least for South Florida '' . STO
* `` By God '' , Waddell said , `` we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times . STO
* I guess you're right '' . STO
* He _RARE_ his drink around and drained it in a few large _RARE_ . STO
* The story was _RARE_ up nicely in his mind : the young _RARE_ , as of old , _RARE_ _RARE_ the unknown ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ in modern _RARE_ America . STO
* `` _RARE_ me in another '' ? STO
* He had asked . STO
* `` Thank you '' , the German had said _RARE_ . STO
* `` I do not drink so much '' . STO
* Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk . STO
* _RARE_ and relief _RARE_ in his _RARE_ emotions . STO
* He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the _RARE_ saint of _RARE_ in a hurried and anxious whisper . STO
* `` _RARE_ Saint _RARE_ , I thank _RARE_ for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered . STO
* And when I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ; crossed himself ; ; said a _RARE_ Mary , slowly and with understanding . STO
* _RARE_ between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to _RARE_ . STO
* `` Holy Mary , Mother of God , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , stay _RARE_ with me on this next dive . STO
* Make it come off all right . STO
* Let me set the record this time , and let me get back _RARE_ , so the German will give me the exclusive . STO
* And make my life different and better from this time on . STO
* Amen '' . STO
* He crossed himself again and rose . STO
* He felt a good deal less _RARE_ . STO
* As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk . STO
* Artie had picked up a _RARE_ and was _RARE_ it on his forefinger . STO
* He waited _RARE_ before he said , `` Roy , you know your _RARE_ table , don't you '' ? STO
* `` You know I know it '' , Robinson answered _RARE_ . STO
* `` You came straight up from _RARE_ without a stop '' , Artie said . STO
* `` Well , I was a little bit confused . STO
* Anyway , I wasn't down long enough to matter . STO
* You don't see me stretched out on the deck , do you '' ? STO
* `` You know what they say about two deep _RARE_ in one day '' , Artie went on , still _RARE_ the _RARE_ and studying it _RARE_ . STO
* `` I don't think you should go down again '' . STO
* Early that day Matsuo saw a marine . STO
* The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a _RARE_ shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were _RARE_ . STO
* As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand . STO
* He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed . STO
* In the _RARE_ part of the tree , _RARE_ a broad horizontal _RARE_ , he could see over the meadow . STO
* For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time . STO
* He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably _RARE_ _RARE_ , they would soon come hunting . STO
* His _RARE_ had emphasized that marines _RARE_ others for the sheer pleasure . STO
* _RARE_ ; ; today ; ; tomorrow : no surrender . STO
* His remembering the _RARE_ brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt . STO
* He murmured to himself , with _RARE_ : `` No surrender '' . STO
* It was best to die fighting the marines . STO
* His _RARE_ had also _RARE_ this , saying it was the way for eternal honor . STO
* What if the marines never came ? STO
* His comrades were all dead . STO
* He had no rice . STO
* Then it would be a choice between _RARE_ and suicide . STO
* _RARE_ the way , he would _RARE_ in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an _RARE_ of his _RARE_ . STO
* He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk . STO
* His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife . STO
* The knife , an ammunition _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ bottle of purified water hung on his belt . STO
* Besides the belt he wore a _RARE_ cloth . STO
* As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though _RARE_ whether to brave the sunlight . STO
* His _RARE_ made a streak of almost _RARE_ green in the mist . STO
* `` Come out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath . STO
* The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face . STO
* A signal ? STO
* Matsuo lifted his rifle , _RARE_ the _RARE_ under his left upper arm for _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ on his mind were events of the past day when his whole _RARE_ was destroyed in the hills . STO
* They had fought from _RARE_ , and the marines _RARE_ to burning them out . STO
* Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ great orange _RARE_ . STO
* A wave of flame _RARE_ through their cave had reached _RARE_ , his friend , and with a _RARE_ the man _RARE_ through the entrance , then slowed to the _RARE_ walk of a _RARE_ , his uniform _RARE_ . STO
* The marines let him advance . STO
* When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to _RARE_ without _RARE_ the stroke of mercy . STO
* Matsuo had _RARE_ death and was _RARE_ on a stack of _RARE_ , both the burned and the _RARE_ , the latter _RARE_ rapidly under the _RARE_ sun . STO
* The _RARE_ marines had laughed at each other's _RARE_ , while _RARE_ bodies . STO
* Matsuo repeatedly _RARE_ down his own _RARE_ . STO
* At _RARE_ he had been able to _RARE_ down a hillside and into the jungle , _RARE_ of death . STO
* _RARE_ he peered to the left , to the right into the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He decided that the marines must be _RARE_ around the meadow , with the one left to _RARE_ him . STO
* He strained his hearing . STO
* _RARE_ feet _RARE_ on _RARE_ ; ; faint _RARE_ of belts and _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ : he heard none of these . STO
* Only the _RARE_ of insects and the distant _RARE_ call of a bird . STO
* Because he couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were there . STO
* A spectacle occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ; leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he _RARE_ it . STO
* _RARE_ made Matsuo tremble . STO
* While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ aim at the man's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind . STO
* He wanted the _RARE_ marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head . STO
* The shot _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ of sound . STO
* _RARE_ followed . STO
* Like a _RARE_ boy expecting punishment , Matsuo _RARE_ reaction from the jungle . STO
* How stupid to give his position away . STO
* The jungle did not _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ remained seated hugging the tree . STO
* Before long the atmosphere _RARE_ to its old _RARE_ , and insects _RARE_ and birds occasionally called . STO
* Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete _RARE_ , _RARE_ that he was the butt of a _RARE_ joke . STO
* Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes . STO
* He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind _RARE_ of the tail . STO
* It ended when he tumbled ; ; but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction . STO
* He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon . STO
* With a sudden _RARE_ he lurched in _RARE_ direction , crossing the meadow in a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face . STO
* The pockets of his jacket _RARE_ . STO
* Hand _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk . STO
* The marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward . STO
* In the _RARE_ that followed the _RARE_ , Matsuo was tense . STO
* They could come on him now without difficulty . STO
* _RARE_ he reached a conclusion . STO
* The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have _RARE_ to knock him from the tree . STO
* _RARE_ the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of _RARE_ . STO
* The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended . STO
* Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out . STO
* _RARE_ ? STO
* _RARE_ leveled on the man , he made a rush . STO
* _RARE_ , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd . STO
* He _RARE_ by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground . STO
* With a _RARE_ motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back . STO
* He was _RARE_ . STO
* The bullet had _RARE_ in the area of the right _RARE_ ; ; around the hole , blood _RARE_ in a little patch . STO
* _RARE_ his _RARE_ on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while _RARE_ in the jacket pockets . STO
* In one : a package of cigarettes and a _RARE_ lighter , both sticky from the man's bleeding . STO
* In the other : a _RARE_ with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief . STO
* One by one he tossed the objects aside . STO
* He didn't smoke and could not light fires with a _RARE_ lighter ; ; he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running . STO
* Then there was no saying how many times the marine had _RARE_ his nose on the handkerchief . STO
* Too bad the marine had no water . STO
* From its holder he took his own _RARE_ . STO
* The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty _RARE_ as he applied pressure . STO
* The _RARE_ eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened _RARE_ in the glare . STO
* So , alive . STO
* Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips . STO
* The marine reached up a hand . STO
* Matsuo shook his head . STO
* `` None for you '' . STO
* The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand . STO
* Not only had he no _RARE_ , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on . STO
* `` You came well equipped to die '' . STO
* Some odor made him lean over the man . STO
* He _RARE_ and recognized it . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* So that had been his difficulty . STO
* _RARE_ on sake , he must have wandered off from his _RARE_ . STO
* The marine tried to roll on his right side , and _RARE_ . STO
* When he rolled on the left side , _RARE_ on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over . STO
* `` Be a good _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle . STO
* The smell of sake had _RARE_ _RARE_ events in his thoughts . STO
* In the _RARE_ , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake . STO
* The marine shut his eyes . STO
* `` Are you a _RARE_ of flame , marine '' ? STO
* Matsuo took the small knife from its _RARE_ and laid it on the ground , out of the _RARE_ reach and away from their shadows . STO
* He waited in his squat , _RARE_ the hair . STO
* Every so often he turned the knife . STO
* Its blade was _RARE_ in the intense sunlight . STO
* The sun was noon high and Matsuo _RARE_ until his body was dripping . STO
* _RARE_ also were the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the face had an oily film . STO
* The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes . STO
* Now and again he murmured something that ended in a _RARE_ . STO
* He must have _RARE_ himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze . STO
* Matsuo shook his head . STO
* Strange . STO
* At last he reached for the knife . STO
* Even the bone handle _RARE_ , and he retrieved the _RARE_ handkerchief to _RARE_ it . STO
* First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes . STO
* The marine yelled and flung the hand away . STO
* With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek . STO
* A shrill _RARE_ , kicked legs , and _RARE_ hands that circled _RARE_ wrist . STO
* Matsuo _RARE_ free and burned the hands into retreat ; ; burned the other cheek ; ; burned each hand when they came _RARE_ again . STO
* The marine _RARE_ to weep and it _RARE_ the sense of _RARE_ . STO
* Matsuo stood up . STO
* `` A small measure of payment , marine '' . STO
* He dropped the knife in its _RARE_ , hung the rifle behind a shoulder . STO
* The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his _RARE_ side onto his stomach . STO
* He _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back . STO
* The marine was still . STO
* He would soon die . STO
* As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom _RARE_ him like a jungle shadow . STO
* What now ? STO
* In the jungle , birds were _RARE_ , while insects preserved only the _RARE_ of living . STO
* Someone called . STO
* It was the marine : head lifted , he strained and called . STO
* Then he _RARE_ Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat . STO
* He _RARE_ his mouth and yelled . STO
* Matsuo _RARE_ the rifle off his shoulder . STO
* Once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die . STO
* He aimed , but listened . STO
* It sounded as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese _RARE_ there , Japanese '' . STO
* The man tilted back his head and went through the _RARE_ of drinking from a container . STO
* He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Matsuo called . STO
* The marine nodded vigorously . STO
* Matsuo laughed , _RARE_ the rifle . STO
* The marine was a _RARE_ . STO
* His _RARE_ had said that all marines were _RARE_ . STO
* The marine slumped forward into a bow like a _RARE_ before an _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ his own _RARE_ , Matsuo took out his water bottle . STO
* One swallow was all he would have ; ; he was very _RARE_ , but he must observe water discipline . STO
* His years of _RARE_ had taught him the value of water discipline . STO
* He began to _RARE_ the bottle , the rusty cap _RARE_ on its _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted . STO
* Of course it was water he really _RARE_ ; ; down in the _RARE_ of the sun he was becoming dried out . STO
* The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack . STO
* Matsuo shook his head . STO
* He had no water for an enemy . STO
* And when this was gone , he hadn't even a little bitter _RARE_ to _RARE_ other water if he were to discover some _RARE_ jungle pool . STO
* He _RARE_ the bottle and replaced it . STO
* After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine . STO
* Before much longer the marine _RARE_ down . STO
* His head slumped . STO
* The upper part of his _RARE_ had stained dark . STO
* `` Marine . STO
* There is nothing for you '' , Matsuo said . STO
* `` Your _RARE_ will certainly beat you for your _RARE_ , besides the _RARE_ of it . STO
* I've nothing for you '' . STO
* From the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the _RARE_ . STO
* He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China . STO
* In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , with the village burning about him and shells _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ scraped back and customers hastily _RARE_ their tables as the tall young _RARE_ _RARE_ pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar . STO
* Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were . STO
* Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , _RARE_ supporting his massive frame . STO
* He _RARE_ at the stranger as the distance between them closed . STO
* `` Since when did they allow _RARE_ kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` Seems to me I don't remember _RARE_ any law about that '' . STO
* He straightened up , alert now as the _RARE_ _RARE_ came closer . STO
* `` _RARE_ right here where you are , kid '' , he called . STO
* `` I don't aim to have _RARE_ breathing down my neck when I'm _RARE_ '' : The stranger ignored him . STO
* He didn't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang _RARE_ right hand was on the butt of his revolver . STO
* `` I'm Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I've come for Pat _RARE_ body '' . STO
* `` And what makes you think you're going to get it , pretty boy '' ? STO
* `` Because I'm asking . STO
* Most of the time I get what I ask for '' . STO
* Blue Throat winked at his six _RARE_ . STO
* `` The kid has no manners , boys . STO
* Shall we teach him some '' ? STO
* His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ fist swept over in a _RARE_ right cross and _RARE_ the big _RARE_ on the side of his chin . STO
* His head snapped round and he _RARE_ back , _RARE_ into the table where his _RARE_ were sprawling . STO
* Tilghman _RARE_ on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him _RARE_ against the bar . STO
* A bullet _RARE_ into the bar top an inch from _RARE_ stomach as Blue Throat's _RARE_ started shooting . STO
* Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun . STO
* The _RARE_ roared twice and two men dropped , _RARE_ . STO
* A third shot _RARE_ the light . STO
* Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` You all right , Billy '' ? STO
* `` Yes , George , but I ain't got poor old _RARE_ body yet . STO
* And I aim to have it '' . STO
* He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed . STO
* Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor . STO
* `` _RARE_ , Tilghman , I'm _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` And me '' , said another Blue Throat _RARE_ . STO
* Somebody brought a light . STO
* Tilghman and his partner , George _RARE_ , _RARE_ the men into a corner . STO
* `` And now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I'll repeat what I said . STO
* I've come for Pat _RARE_ body '' . STO
* In two minutes the body of _RARE_ former _RARE_ , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling _RARE_ the previous night , was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial . STO
* Blue Throat , nursing an _RARE_ jaw and a _RARE_ dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the _RARE_ of the fight . STO
* `` That _RARE_ will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George _RARE_ , `` and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him . STO
* Blue Throat won't stand for this . STO
* He'll shoot up the town '' . STO
* The _RARE_ was correct . STO
* The Reverend James _RARE_ had scarcely completed Pat _RARE_ last _RARE_ on _RARE_ Hill in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , when shots were heard in the distance . STO
* `` Amen '' , said the Reverend _RARE_ , _RARE_ his rifle _RARE_ up against a _RARE_ , `` and now my _RARE_ , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere '' . STO
* Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle . STO
* Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his _RARE_ for the last six months , certainly had no intention of _RARE_ his profitable _RARE_ . STO
* It was essential that he should restore his _RARE_ reputation as a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and this was the _RARE_ _RARE_ West method of doing it . STO
* He rode in at the head of sixty _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ and took over a _RARE_ barn at the entrance to Main Street . STO
* The entire length of the street could be _RARE_ with rifle fire from this barn . STO
* Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire . STO
* The _RARE_ citizens of _RARE_ had gathered inside _RARE_ _RARE_ , halfway down the street . STO
* Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived . STO
* He _RARE_ up the situation and shook his head . STO
* `` If Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all _RARE_ up in here for days '' , he said . STO
* `` There's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store '' . STO
* He called the store owner and together they went into the _RARE_ . STO
* Billy returned with six sticks of _RARE_ . STO
* `` I'm gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap '' , he announced , `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window '' . STO
* He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and _RARE_ into _RARE_ . STO
* Blue Throat's men spotted him and a _RARE_ of bullets _RARE_ the store _RARE_ and board walk as he passed . STO
* Fifty yards away from the barn he _RARE_ inside a _RARE_ shop and came out at the back . STO
* Here he couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang . STO
* All he had to do was light the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and _RARE_ the sticks through . STO
* Billy Tilghman did just that . STO
* Within seconds the big barn was _RARE_ into smoking _RARE_ , with every _RARE_ either dead or injured inside . STO
* It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat's _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* Though only slightly injured himself the big _RARE_ never returned to those parts . STO
* To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of _RARE_ , _RARE_ adventures on the side of the law which started in _RARE_ when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet . STO
* Of all the _RARE_ _RARE_ tough boys of the Old West , `` Uncle Billy Tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders . STO
* He was the _RARE_ who survived more _RARE_ than any other famous _RARE_ character in the book . STO
* He saw the most action , beat up more _RARE_ with his bare fists , broke up the most _RARE_ and sent more _RARE_ to the _RARE_ than any other U.S. marshal who lived before or after him . STO
* For fifty years his guns and _RARE_ fists shot holes through and battered the _RARE_ out of the enemies of law and order in the _RARE_ towns of the West . STO
* The _RARE_ of countless western _RARE_ and _RARE_ have been _RARE_ almost to the point of _RARE_ , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his _RARE_ career , his achievements and the _RARE_ _RARE_ he took while _RARE_ the West have remained almost _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ took the view that a _RARE_ was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man _RARE_ it regularly over a period of half a century . STO
* He came within an ace of being _RARE_ with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ by Bill Doolin , these _RARE_ specialized in train _RARE_ but as a _RARE_ they _RARE_ stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns . STO
* Bill _RARE_ ambition , it appeared , was to _RARE_ out his name with bullets alongside those of _RARE_ James and Billy the _RARE_ , and Bill Tilghman had _RARE_ he would stop him . STO
* Tilghman knew that some ranchers were _RARE_ with the Doolin gang . STO
* They bought _RARE_ cattle from the _RARE_ , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , _RARE_ his men in their houses . STO
* Billy decided to set an example by _RARE_ one of the ranchers , named Ed _RARE_ , who lived at Rock Fort . STO
* On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by _RARE_ Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and headed for Rock Fort and _RARE_ ranch . STO
* It was _RARE_ hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside . STO
* The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was _RARE_ out thick smoke . STO
* The two _RARE_ halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door . STO
* `` Wait here , _RARE_ '' , said Tilghman . STO
* `` If I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse '' . STO
* Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and _RARE_ on it . STO
* There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside . STO
* _RARE_ opposite the door was a _RARE_ log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day . STO
* _RARE_ near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed _RARE_ . STO
* `` Hello , Ed '' , said Tilghman . STO
* The rancher grunted an _RARE_ but didn't move . STO
* Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire . STO
* Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a _RARE_ _RARE_ and caused the hairs to _RARE_ on the back of his neck . STO
* _RARE_ each side of the room were six _RARE_ _RARE_ , each one _RARE_ off with a curtain . STO
* And _RARE_ _RARE_ through these curtains were the gleaming _RARE_ of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman . STO
* The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six _RARE_ might _RARE_ into his hide . STO
* _RARE_ fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant . STO
* He walked right up to the fire as though _RARE_ unaware of the guns covering him . STO
* The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer . STO
* `` Cold day '' , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually _RARE_ his _RARE_ to the fire . STO
* `` Just dropped in to ask where Jed _RARE_ lives . STO
* Can't seem to locate _RARE_ in this snow '' . STO
* The rancher was trembling . STO
* He wouldn't look Tilghman in the face . STO
* `` _RARE_ the river for five miles '' , he said _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ is on the south bank '' . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ himself out of that _RARE_ _RARE_ , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes . STO
* All that time rifle _RARE_ were pointing _RARE_ at his head and body . STO
* One false move on his part and he would be a dead man . STO
* `` Well '' , he announced , `` _RARE_ I'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the _RARE_ '' . STO
* He _RARE_ back to the door , _RARE_ softly , hands still _RARE_ behind him . STO
* He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive . STO
* But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon . STO
* If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly . STO
* _RARE_ he climbed on to the wagon next to _RARE_ Brown . STO
* `` Don't say or do anything '' , he said softly . STO
* `` Just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry . STO
* That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang '' . STO
* Even as he spoke those words Billy _RARE_ life hung on a thread . STO
* Back in the house a _RARE_ named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave _RARE_ , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then . STO
* `` You'll stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle . STO
* `` Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back . STO
* We'll let him go '' . STO
* But the fighting _RARE_ _RARE_ run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , _RARE_ , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice _RARE_ . STO
* Wiley _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since . STO
* That night he _RARE_ out of Ma _RARE_ dance hall and proceeded to _RARE_ the peace by shooting off his revolver . STO
* For several months now , Jack _RARE_ , a big _RARE_ boy of fifteen with a _RARE_ , _RARE_ face and _RARE_ _RARE_ eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman . STO
* This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she _RARE_ warmth , a sweet warmth ; ; she would talk to him in a _RARE_ voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him _RARE_ . STO
* When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach . STO
* Then he would run to the toilet behind the house . STO
* Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him . STO
* He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him . STO
* But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right . STO
* And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the _RARE_ _RARE_ school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the _RARE_ face and figure . STO
* He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do . STO
* When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh . STO
* Miss Langford ( her first name was _RARE_ ) was an attractive girl . STO
* _RARE_ , blonde , _RARE_ , fair , _RARE_ without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of _RARE_ _RARE_ as she _RARE_ among the pupils in her fresh , _RARE_ summer dress . STO
* Something was beginning to _RARE_ and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ; but if it had been , it had been _RARE_ until now by fear ) : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack . STO
* She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become _RARE_ and a little sick . STO
* School began in August , the _RARE_ part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very _RARE_ with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another . STO
* The first two or three days they went home early . STO
* All , that is , except Jack . STO
* He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened _RARE_ and put the room in order . STO
* Once ( this was on the third day of school ) she _RARE_ down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare _RARE_ of _RARE_ white leg . STO
* He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating . STO
* About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn't even see him . STO
* He jumped back , _RARE_ and ran , _RARE_ , down the hill away from the school . STO
* He didn't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ; then he slowed to a walk . STO
* The vision became even stronger now . STO
* `` I'll get her yet '' , he muttered to himself . STO
* `` I've got to get her '' . STO
* That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was _RARE_ . STO
* He ate _RARE_ that morning , and his mother became concerned , _RARE_ as he usually ate heartily . STO
* `` What's the matter , honey '' ? STO
* She said , with the _RARE_ of a middle-aged woman for her only child . STO
* `` _RARE_ you hungry '' ? STO
* `` No , I'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs . STO
* Outside it was already hot at _RARE_ A.M. , and it was getting hot in the kitchen . STO
* He felt a little sick at his stomach . STO
* `` Are you sick '' ? STO
* `` No '' , he said . STO
* `` I'll be all right . STO
* I guess it's this hot weather '' . STO
* `` Don't you play hard today then . STO
* And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early . STO
* _RARE_ left the car for me , and I'm going to town this afternoon '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , I won't play hard '' , he promised . STO
* Just then Charles _RARE_ yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the _RARE_ house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' over his shoulder . STO
* `` _RARE_ say , boy '' ? STO
* Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth . STO
* Charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , _RARE_ , with straight black hair like an Indian's and sharp brown eyes . STO
* He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him . STO
* `` You know what I done last night '' ? STO
* Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the _RARE_ _RARE_ , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school . STO
* Jack knew of course that the tale to be _RARE_ would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were _RARE_ only apparent interest . STO
* But Jack always derived _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ ( even when he suspected his friend of _RARE_ or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now . STO
* `` No . STO
* What '' ? STO
* `` I got _RARE_ _RARE_ in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry '' . STO
* A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind . STO
* His heart beat faster . STO
* `` Hell you say '' ? STO
* He said , _RARE_ into the _RARE_ he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles . STO
* `` _RARE_ you do it '' ? STO
* `` Hell , I _RARE_ got on top of -- '' `` No , I mean _RARE_ you get her to do it '' ? STO
* `` Hell , I _RARE_ ask her '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ like that '' ? STO
* `` Hell , yes . STO
* She's been _RARE_ around me a lot here lately , and I _RARE_ I might as _RARE_ try it . STO
* Besides I heard her old uncle that _RARE_ there has been _RARE_ it '' . STO
* `` I never heard that '' . STO
* `` It's all over _RARE_ . STO
* If you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I might try it one of these days '' , Jack said _RARE_ , thinking of Miss Langford . STO
* When they reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse . STO
* Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and _RARE_ white _RARE_ , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside . STO
* `` Time for books '' , she yelled , _RARE_ a little _RARE_ store bell in her right hand . STO
* `` Let's go inside '' . STO
* `` Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just _RARE_ '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling _RARE_ . STO
* `` No , not now '' , said the teacher . STO
* `` Maybe at dinner time . STO
* Come inside now '' . STO
* The children grudgingly stopped playing then and _RARE_ into the schoolhouse . STO
* Jack watched Miss Langford all morning . STO
* He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Occasionally he would look across the _RARE_ at _RARE_ , fourteen and _RARE_ in a fresh green _RARE_ dress , sitting in the _RARE_ row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did . STO
* At _RARE_ , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball . STO
* `` Why ain't you _RARE_ ball '' ? STO
* He asked Charles _RARE_ as they sat in the _RARE_ shade , watching the girls _RARE_ in front of the schoolhouse . STO
* `` Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called . STO
* `` I'd _RARE_ stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned . STO
* `` Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress '' . STO
* `` Maybe '' , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford . STO
* Presently she came out of the schoolhouse . STO
* When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Let's play with 'em '' , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants . STO
* `` O.K. '' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls . STO
* They played crack the whip a few minutes without _RARE_ . STO
* Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled _RARE_ , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head . STO
* While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` _RARE_ , I'm sorry , Miss Langford . STO
* I didn't mean to pull so hard '' . STO
* `` That's all right '' , she said , _RARE_ her head back to get the hair out of her eyes . STO
* `` It was my fault '' . STO
* With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other . STO
* When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet . STO
* He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go . STO
* `` Thank you '' , she said , dusting herself off . STO
* `` Will you play with us again , Miss Langford '' ? STO
* One of the little girls said . STO
* `` No more today . STO
* Maybe some other day '' . STO
* `` Oh , _RARE_ '' , the girl said . STO
* `` I don't believe I'll play any more neither '' . STO
* `` Me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone . STO
* Jack walked off alone out the road in the _RARE_ _RARE_ sun , past Robert _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes . STO
* When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up . STO
* He simply would not work his _RARE_ problems when the teacher held his class . STO
* That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work . STO
* He had considered throwing _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand _RARE_ in a corner instead of stay in after school . STO
* The only _RARE_ now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack . STO
* `` But I've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately . STO
* To his surprise his plan worked perfectly . STO
* `` All right , if you can't do your _RARE_ during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling . STO
* `` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems '' . STO
* And so when the others _RARE_ out that afternoon Jack remained _RARE_ in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a _RARE_ manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home . STO
* He scarcely saw them . STO
* His heart was _RARE_ like a mighty _RARE_ and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , `` How will I do it ? STO
* On the _RARE_ of the amused _RARE_ of white _RARE_ stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and _RARE_ . STO
* She _RARE_ little _RARE_ _RARE_ called _RARE_ belly and kept her green , somewhat _RARE_ eyes fixed on a _RARE_ male who was _RARE_ wildly with a _RARE_ king snake wrapped around his _RARE_ neck . STO
* The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which _RARE_ to the woman . STO
* _RARE_ and muscular , he had _RARE_ features , and his light color told of the European _RARE_ who had been intimate with the slave women of his family . STO
* The _RARE_ white girl turned to a distinguished , _RARE_ man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It is almost time for and _RARE_ to begin '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ was one of New _RARE_ most important and _RARE_ slave owners . STO
* He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start . STO
* The slaves ran _RARE_ to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ vigorously _RARE_ two bleached _RARE_ bones against the _RARE_ which served as his _RARE_ . STO
* He showed his gleaming _RARE_ of teeth and bellowed _RARE_ , his brass _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ as he shook and trembled in _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ with frantic intensity as the _RARE_ began the _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ which had long been a favorite of _RARE_ _RARE_ and their _RARE_ in the _RARE_ slave compounds . STO
* The dance was of _RARE_ origin . STO
* The white girl with the penetrating green eyes _RARE_ the _RARE_ handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had _RARE_ skin and _RARE_ eyebrows . STO
* He was _RARE_ in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and _RARE_ the manners of his owners . STO
* He proudly wore the blue _RARE_ of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr. Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the _RARE_ oldest and most cherished names . STO
* Delphine was a _RARE_ in high society . STO
* She was a top _RARE_ and one of the city's most _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a _RARE_ , a _RARE_ and _RARE_ mad -- the _RARE_ of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil . STO
* Madame Lalaurie _RARE_ with her riding _RARE_ toward the _RARE_ youth who was _RARE_ and _RARE_ with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders . STO
* The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves . STO
* He was _RARE_ with animal _RARE_ and a potent _RARE_ for women of any race . STO
* But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ St. John . STO
* _RARE_ , actually , he avoided _RARE_ _RARE_ and seemed truly _RARE_ of the _RARE_ desires when they sought to make _RARE_ with him in the open fields , in _RARE_ and in _RARE_ . STO
* This young slave was therefore quite _RARE_ when Delphine Lalaurie _RARE_ that she wanted him to draw near . STO
* The woman eyed the youth with the _RARE_ a coin _RARE_ might display toward a rare _RARE_ which is not yet in his collection . STO
* `` What is your name , boy ? STO
* Come a bit closer . STO
* I won't bite , you know '' . STO
* He _RARE_ at Madame Lalaurie and _RARE_ the Paris perfume which _RARE_ from her . STO
* Then he smiled _RARE_ . STO
* `` My name is Dandy Brandon , _RARE_ . STO
* I belong to _RARE_ Alexander Prieur '' . STO
* She said with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms . STO
* You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy '' . STO
* Mrs. Lalaurie impatiently _RARE_ the slave toward her waiting carriage . STO
* _RARE_ her _RARE_ , she climbed in , never _RARE_ her grip on his arm . STO
* The woman seemed utterly _RARE_ of the snake which _RARE_ on the floor in a _RARE_ . STO
* Once inside the _RARE_ _RARE_ , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ at last , and after a few _RARE_ _RARE_ on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her _RARE_ driver . STO
* This was the big man with the _RARE_ air and the _RARE_ , _RARE_ eyebrows . STO
* `` _RARE_ ! STO
* I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase . STO
* There's $600 in gold in this _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer . STO
* Prieur has _RARE_ and depends on _RARE_ pills and _RARE_ . STO
* Besides , he _RARE_ 300 slaves . STO
* One less shouldn't matter to him '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ who had been brought in _RARE_ years before from his native _RARE_ _RARE_ , smiled _RARE_ and touched his _RARE_ _RARE_ hat . STO
* His bold eyes _RARE_ the woman , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner . STO
* `` Another youth , Madame '' ? STO
* The _RARE_ said softly . STO
* `` This one is a tender chicken , _RARE_ ? STO
* Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh . STO
* It will _RARE_ and _RARE_ easily for Madame '' . STO
* `` Be quiet , _RARE_ ! STO
* You are _RARE_ your place '' . STO
* The tall _RARE_ walked off _RARE_ in search of Alexander Prieur . STO
* Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her _RARE_ hands and drove Dandy Brandon -- _RARE_ in the back seat of the carriage -- to her mansion at _RARE_ _RARE_ Street . STO
* Dr. Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the _RARE_ mansion . STO
* Dandy , curiosity overcoming his _RARE_ , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle . STO
* He saw a _RARE_ man with a _RARE_ _RARE_ beard and an unusually large head . STO
* Dr. Lalaurie wore a _RARE_ smoking jacket , and his _RARE_ eyes were _RARE_ and _RARE_ behind thick _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He was about 50 years old . STO
* `` Another young man , my dear ? STO
* Really , you are most _RARE_ to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with _RARE_ . STO
* Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ it like a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis . STO
* I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual _RARE_ , quite _RARE_ in many ways . STO
* He _RARE_ a better life than just _RARE_ away on the Prieur _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Quite so , my dear . STO
* His room will be ready shortly '' . STO
* The _RARE_ led the horses to the stable after a _RARE_ glance at the _RARE_ slave . STO
* Had Dandy been older or wiser , _RARE_ might have warned him that he would be well advised to _RARE_ from the _RARE_ tender care if he _RARE_ his life . STO
* But he liked the smell of _RARE_ perfume . STO
* Besides , her _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth . STO
* Also , he was weary of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* So Dandy Brandon _RARE_ entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and _RARE_ up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home . STO
* _RARE_ and dingy though it was , the attic represented _RARE_ to a slave who had led a _RARE_ life with six brothers and sisters and _RARE_ relatives in a _RARE_ at _RARE_ St. John . STO
* He bounced _RARE_ on the _RARE_ bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than _RARE_ . STO
* It was just as well that the _RARE_ Dandy enjoyed himself to the _RARE_ that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell . STO
* When he finally left the sinister mansion on _RARE_ Street , he was carried out in a _RARE_ basket . STO
* Just six weeks after Dandy _RARE_ arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his _RARE_ young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New _RARE_ oldest and _RARE_ families were invited . STO
* A _RARE_ orchestra played softly behind the _RARE_ palms , and Delphine _RARE_ _RARE_ among her guests , _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ races , the latest _RARE_ from Paris , and _RARE_ politics . STO
* Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ and died as the musicians and guests _RARE_ at an _RARE_ descending the marble staircase . STO
* It was Dandy Brandon , _RARE_ only in a bloody _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ as if the devil were breathing hard on him . STO
* The _RARE_ once _RARE_ body was a mass of scars and _RARE_ . STO
* His _RARE_ face showed the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` _RARE_ woman ! STO
* You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home '' . STO
* These were the last words he ever _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ shirt and _RARE_ the politician wore . STO
* Dr. Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the _RARE_ dance floor and pronounced him dead . STO
* The ball broke up in confusion . STO
* _RARE_ stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the _RARE_ corpse . STO
* But at the _RARE_ _RARE_ Delphine told a _RARE_ story . STO
* `` I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square _RARE_ and felt sorry for him . STO
* It was our hope to _RARE_ him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest . STO
* After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night . STO
* How he returned in such a _RARE_ condition , or why , I cannot say . STO
* Dr. Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs '' . STO
* She _RARE_ at her swimming eyes with a _RARE_ handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : `` That poor boy ! STO
* He must have fallen in with evil _RARE_ , for he was a simple youth and quite _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die . STO
* Such a _RARE_ end '' ! STO
* Though the _RARE_ dying words about the woman troubled the _RARE_ panel , _RARE_ _RARE_ was _RARE_ an _RARE_ by the jury and _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ were at the top _RARE_ of the social ladder , and even a jury didn't feel _RARE_ to doubt the _RARE_ of so _RARE_ a lady . STO
* Moreover , _RARE_ slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* So the _RARE_ was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting _RARE_ testimony , _RARE_ her and the doctor back into the fold . STO
* Once again life went its _RARE_ way -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , balls and dinners . STO
* The excitement over _RARE_ _RARE_ death _RARE_ and Madame _RARE_ stock _RARE_ when she resumed her _RARE_ _RARE_ of visiting the poor and bringing _RARE_ and comfort to _RARE_ patients in the county hospital . STO
* Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set _RARE_ to _RARE_ at a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Mrs. _RARE_ _RARE_ , socially prominent and a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and _RARE_ an amazing sight . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ and his _RARE_ , Delphine Lalaurie , were _RARE_ a young girl -- an _RARE_ of _RARE_ beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion . STO
* The girl was not more than 16 . STO
* She was nude to the waist and her tumbled _RARE_ of black hair did not _RARE_ the knife _RARE_ on her back . STO
* The bleeding girl was _RARE_ fast ; ; the _RARE_ and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down _RARE_ Street . STO
* The _RARE_ cried out in an oddly _RARE_ voice : `` Help me , somebody ! STO
* They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will _RARE_ out my tongue with her _RARE_ ! STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that _RARE_ stuff , and the first chair _RARE_ me '' ! STO
* Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him _RARE_ from every decent -- and even _RARE_ -- group from _RARE_ Village to the _RARE_ , he had become a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` There ain't _RARE_ faster , or _RARE_ , or more direct than a _RARE_ freight when you _RARE_ go _RARE_ '' , Feathertop would say . STO
* `` The _RARE_ may not be the _RARE_ , but man ! STO
* There ain't nobody _RARE_ for your ticket _RARE_ , neither '' . STO
* He had been _RARE_ the _RARE_ for a long , long time now . STO
* Ever since the _RARE_ , and the trouble with the _RARE_ , and _RARE_ and the child . STO
* Ever since all that . STO
* It had been a very long time that had no form and no end . STO
* He was -- as he told himself in the _RARE_ of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out . STO
* Out and out and never to return again . STO
* _RARE_ one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been _RARE_ . STO
* That was the day it ended . STO
* The freight car was cold , early in the morning . STO
* He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay _RARE_ , the rattling and _RARE_ of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his _RARE_ . STO
* He held his _RARE_ away from his body , and the little sweet _RARE_ _RARE_ neatly and sweetly as he _RARE_ its _RARE_ . STO
* The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ; at first _RARE_ , caught by _RARE_ of corn -- then with a _RARE_ into its slot . STO
* The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor . STO
* She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full _RARE_ skirt drawing up her thighs , and _RARE_ music _RARE_ away . STO
* `` Now that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner . STO
* A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted . STO
* _RARE_ , that was the word , hot ! STO
* _RARE_ like a _RARE_ _RARE_ wings , with the sun shining down over them . STO
* A poet , yet ! STO
* His thoughts for the _RARE_ neck , the full , high breasts , the _RARE_ waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however . STO
* _RARE_ ! STO
* Then the boy _RARE_ himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting . STO
* He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight . STO
* _RARE_ hair , high cheekbones , wide _RARE_ mouth , a pair of _RARE_ _RARE_ hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can _RARE_ you for ten minutes -- but then I'm finished . STO
* `` We made it , Cappy '' , the _RARE_ said . STO
* `` Yeah , seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig _RARE_ from his dirty pants . STO
* `` None of that . STO
* We run a respectable house here '' . STO
* They _RARE_ and saw him , standing there dim in the _RARE_ light from the _RARE_ freight wall . STO
* He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the _RARE_ tops of his shoes . STO
* He held the black plastic _RARE_ lightly . STO
* `` Come sit '' , said Feathertop , _RARE_ them toward him . STO
* `` That _RARE_ is _RARE_ over here '' . STO
* The girl smiled , and started forward . STO
* The boy yanked her back hard , _RARE_ her off her feet , and gathered her into the _RARE_ of his arm . STO
* `` Now stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped _RARE_ . STO
* `` I _RARE_ to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do . STO
* We don't know this guy '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , square bit '' , Feathertop _RARE_ his face up . STO
* This guy was strictly from _RARE_ . STO
* But nowhere ! STO
* `` What is with this _RARE_ jazz '' ? STO
* Feathertop inquired , _RARE_ against the _RARE_ _RARE_ wall . STO
* `` We -- we _RARE_ '' , Cappy said . STO
* His head came up and he said it _RARE_ . STO
* `` Well , _RARE_ '' . STO
* Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand . STO
* These two were going to be easy _RARE_ . STO
* They couldn't have much dough , but then none of the _RARE_ Feathertop rolled had much . STO
* And besides , the _RARE_ had a little something the others didn't have . STO
* That was gonna be fun collecting ! STO
* But not just yet . STO
* Feathertop was a _RARE_ . STO
* He liked to _RARE_ his meat before he tasted it . STO
* `` Come sit '' , he repeated , _RARE_ to the piled hay bags , over the pig _RARE_ . STO
* `` I'm just a poor _RARE_ man , name of -- _RARE_ -- _RARE_ Smith '' . STO
* He grinned at them _RARE_ . STO
* `` That ain't your name , Mister '' , the boy accused . STO
* `` And you know -- you're right '' ! STO
* Feathertop aimed a finger at him . STO
* `` Oh , come on , Cappy '' , the girl _RARE_ . STO
* `` He's okay . STO
* He's a nice guy '' . STO
* She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her . STO
* Feathertop watched the smooth _RARE_ of her _RARE_ , _RARE_ legs as she walked to the bags , and _RARE_ them beneath her , _RARE_ the skirt out in a wide circle . STO
* He cleared his throat ; ; it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within _RARE_ distance . STO
* He had it all _RARE_ , of course . STO
* _RARE_ the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a _RARE_ ball with the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ -- _RARE_ ! STO
* `` _RARE_ you come from , Mr. -- _RARE_ -- Mr. Smith '' ? STO
* Kitty inquired politely . STO
* `` Where from '' ? STO
* He _RARE_ . STO
* `` Out . STO
* I been riding train for a ways now '' . STO
* They _RARE_ into silence , and the freight _RARE_ up a hill , _RARE_ down the other side , shaking and _RARE_ to itself . STO
* After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We'll just have to wait till we pull into _RARE_ , honey '' . STO
* `` What's the matter , she _RARE_ go the bathroom '' ? STO
* Ernie found it immensely funny . STO
* The boy _RARE_ at him , and the girl looked shocked . STO
* `` No ! STO
* Certainly not , I mean , no that isn't what I said '' ! STO
* She snapped at him . STO
* `` I only said I was hungry . STO
* We haven't had anything to eat all day '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ Feathertop Ernie _RARE_ voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ say so , fellow _RARE_ ! STO
* Why , we got dinner right here . STO
* _RARE_ , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two '' . STO
* Cappy looked _RARE_ , but he moved off the _RARE_ and followed the dirty _RARE_ to the center of the _RARE_ boxcar . STO
* Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag . STO
* He took out a small _RARE_ filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and _RARE_ folded piece of tin foil with holes in it . STO
* He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot . STO
* `` A charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ it '' , he told Cappy , _RARE_ him a sheet of newspaper . STO
* `` Yeah , but _RARE_ we gonna eat ? STO
* _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Ernie _RARE_ a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my _RARE_ patience '' . STO
* He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ dogs , man . STO
* Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly _RARE_ '' . STO
* He _RARE_ down the _RARE_ carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil . STO
* Almost immediately they began to _RARE_ . STO
* He looked up and grinned . STO
* `` A _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , he explained . STO
* `` I _RARE_ '' . STO
* When they had licked the last of the _RARE_ taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette . STO
* _RARE_ kid , Ernie thought , too bad . STO
* `` How come you're riding the _RARE_ , kids like you '' ? STO
* Ernie asked . STO
* Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply . STO
* But surprisingly , Kitty's face came up and she said , `` My father . STO
* He didn't want us to get married . STO
* So we ran away '' . STO
* `` Why didn't he want you to get _RARE_ '' ? STO
* This time even she did not answer . STO
* She looked down at her hands , too . STO
* After a few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy . STO
* It was my fault '' . STO
* _RARE_ head came around sharply . STO
* `` Your fault , hell ! STO
* It was all my fault . STO
* If I'd been careful it never _RARE_ '' -- he stopped abruptly . STO
* _RARE_ eyebrows went up . STO
* `` What's the matter '' ? STO
* The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I'm pregnant '' . STO
* Cappy raged at himself . STO
* `` Oh he was stupid , her old man ! STO
* You never heard _RARE_ like it : Kitty's gonna go have an _RARE_ , and Kitty's gonna go away to a _RARE_ , and Kitty's this and Kitty's that like he was _RARE_ or _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Ernie nodded . STO
* This was a slightly different matter . STO
* He remembered _RARE_ , and the child . STO
* But that had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about . STO
* A time before the white lightning and the _RARE_ had turned him inside out . STO
* But these kids weren't like him . STO
* Oh _RARE_ ! STO
* He thought , _RARE_ out of it , old son . STO
* These are just another couple of characters to roll . STO
* What they got , you get . STO
* Now forget all this other . STO
* `` _RARE_ drink '' ? STO
* Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet _RARE_ from his jacket pocket . STO
* `` Yeah . STO
* Now that you offer '' . STO
* The answer came from the open door of the boxcar . STO
* From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade . STO
* Ernie stared at the man . STO
* He was big . STO
* _RARE_ big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a _RARE_ . STO
* Road gang , Ernie thought . STO
* `` You gonna give me a drink , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* The big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar . STO
* Ernie hesitated a moment . STO
* This character could break him in half . STO
* `` Sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips . STO
* He _RARE_ down _RARE_ of the strong _RARE_ and _RARE_ the remainder . STO
* The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden _RARE_ . STO
* He took the bottle with undue _RARE_ , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely . STO
* He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door . STO
* `` Well , now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket . STO
* `` I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car '' . STO
* `` We're going to Philadelphia '' , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more . STO
* `` No , I don't think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final _RARE_ for Ernie . STO
* He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it . STO
* `` Maybe you and me will , _RARE_ , but these two ain't goin' nowhere '' . STO
* He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car . STO
* Ernie was screaming inside himself : No , damn you , you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me ! STO
* The _RARE_ stalked toward them , and Kitty _RARE_ back , her hand to her mouth . STO
* Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard . STO
* The kid hit the bigger man with an _RARE_ _RARE_ ! STO
* And carried him backward in a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but _RARE_ arms and legs . STO
* The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back . STO
* The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go , `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Then they were _RARE_ again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious _RARE_ . STO
* He held the knife _RARE_ an instant -- an instant enough to press the _RARE_ . STO
* The blade came out with a _RARE_ ! STO
* He _RARE_ the knife _RARE_ , and drew back to _RARE_ it into the kid's throat . STO
* Kitty screamed _RARE_ and her face was white . STO
* She grabbed at _RARE_ sleeve and _RARE_ , `` Help him ! STO
* Help him ! STO
* Do something '' ! STO
* They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man . STO
* To them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after _RARE_ , and at noon , and at six each evening -- its tone , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , never breaking the boredom of the streets . STO
* The Old Man was unimportant . STO
* Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; ; or the smell of thick _RARE_ _RARE_ -- the ripe smell that was both sweet and _RARE_ -- rising up from aluminum _RARE_ wrapped in _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Or the _RARE_ whirling sounds of _RARE_ at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the _RARE_ street lights . STO
* Or the bay of female dogs in heat . STO
* They never called him by name , although he had one . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , that's what he was called in the old country ; ; but here he was just _RARE_ or the Old Man . STO
* But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ when commanded . STO
* It went to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession . STO
* But youth asked nothing of its parents -- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing . STO
* The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened . STO
* But the past was dead here as the present was dead . STO
* Once the Old Man had had a wife . STO
* And once she , too , ignored him . STO
* With a tiny _RARE_ wrapped around her shoulders , she _RARE_ her _RARE_ _RARE_ down the street before him and didn't stop . STO
* In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase . STO
* The way she _RARE_ down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both . STO
* Without looking at him , without looking at anything except _RARE_ Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange _RARE_ , rode away in it , and never came back . STO
* `` But she shouldn't have come here in the first place '' , the women had said . STO
* `` No , no . STO
* Not that one . STO
* She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ ! STO
* She gave herself fancy _RARE_ ! STO
* Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours '' . STO
* They had slapped their thighs . STO
* `` It's not for making pretty speeches about _RARE_ those _RARE_ get paid so good '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* _RARE_ fingers , _RARE_ only by the _RARE_ of polished _RARE_ , had swayed excitedly beneath _RARE_ _RARE_ where tiny black hairs _RARE_ , never to be _RARE_ away . STO
* _RARE_ mouths that had never known anything _RARE_ than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a _RARE_ . STO
* It was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the _RARE_ _RARE_ of a woman he had _RARE_ -- watching her become _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the distance , as thin as the _RARE_ on her stockings , and still _RARE_ . STO
* His voice had not commanded her to stop . STO
* It had not questioned why . STO
* The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; ; but he might have been _RARE_ away the _RARE_ that _RARE_ from his yellow dog onto him . STO
* ( He was never without that dog . STO
* ) And his eyes -- those _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ yellow -- had not altered their expression or direction . STO
* The Old _RARE_ very soul could have left him and _RARE_ down that street , but he wouldn't have had anyone know it . STO
* Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife . STO
* But when he called for his _RARE_ , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that _RARE_ ? STO
* There seemed to be a _RARE_ purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to _RARE_ Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him . STO
* For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the _RARE_ of Philadelphia . STO
* It could have been _RARE_ or _RARE_ for the way it smelled . STO
* What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of _RARE_ Road stretched beneath _RARE_ trains that roared from the _RARE_ station into the city's center at _RARE_ intervals ? STO
* Or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the _RARE_ ? STO
* This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his _RARE_ . STO
* To him they were one and the same . STO
* _RARE_ for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of _RARE_ trees which divided these quarters from the city . STO
* _RARE_ lined the streets with two-story houses the color of _RARE_ . STO
* It slashed the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden _RARE_ . STO
* It swayed with the _RARE_ _RARE_ and screeched with the _RARE_ _RARE_ of screen doors . STO
* Even the _RARE_ , which _RARE_ nothing now but the scent of _RARE_ , had a lawn before it . STO
* And the coffee shop on _RARE_ Street , where the men spent their _RARE_ and _RARE_ playing cards , had a rose _RARE_ beneath its window . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ of coffee _RARE_ thrown against it . STO
* Only one house on the street had no lawn before it . STO
* It _RARE_ low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron _RARE_ supporting a glass _RARE_ . STO
* That was _RARE_ shop . STO
* Above it , from a _RARE_ _RARE_ , wooden angels _RARE_ the neighborhood . STO
* Did the Old Man remember them there ? STO
* Yet everywhere else _RARE_ was _RARE_ and wood in square blocks -- like _RARE_ _RARE_ against the _RARE_ of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery . STO
* Only _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ through the walls of those _RARE_ into the mysterious core of _RARE_ behind the houses where _RARE_ owned no fences , where one man's property _RARE_ with the next to form _RARE_ in which no one knew privacy . STO
* Love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by _RARE_ trees and _RARE_ vines . STO
* And the _RARE_ tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch . STO
* The Old Man silently fed upon these streets . STO
* They kept him alive , waiting . STO
* _RARE_ for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not . STO
* It was as though he had made a _RARE_ with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price . STO
* He was holding out for something . STO
* He was determined to hold out . STO
* The Old _RARE_ son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the _RARE_ of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich . STO
* At fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother , that he couldn't remember her face or her touch ; ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him . STO
* He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his _RARE_ , and he couldn't have cared less about that either . STO
* To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep . STO
* When he would be a man , he would be a rich man . STO
* He would not be like the `` rich Americans '' who lived in _RARE_ houses on the other side of the park . STO
* He would not ride the _RARE_ local to the city each morning . STO
* He would not carry a brief case . STO
* Nor would he work at all . STO
* He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step . STO
* He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a _RARE_ fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , _RARE_ with her running , calling out in her _RARE_ , `` At your service '' . STO
* He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his _RARE_ pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff -- he would not remove his _RARE_ -- and light and smoke . STO
* He could do that when he would be a man . STO
* `` Hey , Laura '' ! STO
* He called to his sister on the porch above the steps . STO
* She was only ten months older than he . STO
* `` Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe '' ? STO
* Laura did not answer him . STO
* She leaned _RARE_ against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , _RARE_ hair in the sun . STO
* One _RARE_ leg _RARE_ the _RARE_ and swung loosely before the _RARE_ , torn _RARE_ . STO
* Her tanned foot , whose _RARE_ swept high and white , pointed _RARE_ toward _RARE_ toes -- toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white . STO
* All the while she sat there , her _RARE_ arms _RARE_ before her chest . STO
* Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii . STO
* It was a face that had lost its _RARE_ _RARE_ and was beginning to fold within its _RARE_ features a _RARE_ that _RARE_ the _RARE_ lines of its contours . STO
* The eyes , blue and always somewhat _RARE_ , possessed a sullen quality . STO
* Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were _RARE_ by distance . STO
* He was never sure they fully took him in . STO
* Pompeii called again , `` Laura '' ! STO
* But the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it . STO
* `` She's in a mood '' , he thought `` There's not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood '' . STO
* Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ? STO
* And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him . STO
* Not even Laura . STO
* Suddenly he was interrupted in his _RARE_ by a warm _RARE_ _RARE_ against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a _RARE_ _RARE_ tongue , _RARE_ against the salt taste of him . STO
* Above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ within a sphere of _RARE_ pink skin , stared _RARE_ at him . STO
* `` Christ sake , _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' ! STO
* But the _RARE_ would not . STO
* `` You're boiling milk , ain't you '' ? STO
* _RARE_ it with his hand , knowing the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the swollen _RARE_ of _RARE_ that wrinkled _RARE_ to his touch . STO
* Pompeii rolled over . STO
* His head _RARE_ gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those _RARE_ . STO
* With his mouth opened wide , he _RARE_ the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue _RARE_ the light , _RARE_ taste of it . STO
* The boy's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a _RARE_ player , pressing and pulling , _RARE_ in what he did . STO
* Above him slid the _RARE_ shadow of a storm cloud . STO
* Its form was a heavy figure in a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But the boy could see only the _RARE_ belly . STO
* The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something _RARE_ in it . STO
* He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he wouldn't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow _RARE_ back . STO
* There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due . STO
* Time enough to give up his soul . STO
* In the _RARE_ , six _RARE_ , stained an _RARE_ , the same color as _RARE_ shaved hair , _RARE_ up close to him . STO
* The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the _RARE_ pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the _RARE_ and pretended to be _RARE_ its _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* He knew at a glance that the _RARE_ _RARE_ belonged to _RARE_ , the _RARE_ ones to _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ ones to _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ brother . STO
* Pompeii expected _RARE_ small body to sink closer and closer to the ground . STO
* He expected _RARE_ thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , _RARE_ voice to sound against the _RARE_ of his _RARE_ flesh that was never sure of hearing anything . STO
* People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it . STO
* The room filled with smoke , and _RARE_ head _RARE_ with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie couldn't bear to do anything to _RARE_ it . STO
* Little Anne rapidly _RARE_ her mother in recovery . STO
* In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ hair all over her head . STO
* She stopped flying into _RARE_ and started _RARE_ her food ; ; she developed a _RARE_ and cream _RARE_ and a _RARE_ _RARE_ , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her . STO
* She was so heavy that _RARE_ arms shook from _RARE_ her and taking care of her . STO
* Maggie couldn't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be _RARE_ through the _RARE_ old _RARE_ and _RARE_ out and _RARE_ back ; ; there was the daily round of household _RARE_ in which Maggie insisted on participating . STO
* _RARE_ had a great deal to do with it ; ; Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ would have preferred death and _RARE_ to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's _RARE_ , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and _RARE_ and soap , just plain soap . STO
* Maggie and Stuart _RARE_ over figures every night , trying to find how they could _RARE_ out a few _RARE_ more . STO
* In _RARE_ Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon : `` Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things '' ? STO
* `` It seems to me you have enough to do as it is '' , Eugenia said . STO
* She had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again . STO
* `` I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something '' , Maggie said . STO
* `` It would make me feel a lot better , but the _RARE_ Exchange isn't taking _RARE_ goods any more and I can't leave the baby with Grandma because she isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery '' . STO
* `` I should think so '' , Eugenia said . STO
* `` For one thing you can stop keeping that child in _RARE_ dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day '' . STO
* `` She's so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice '' . STO
* Maggie said . STO
* She picked up the baby and _RARE_ her fat warm little neck . STO
* `` She'll be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be _RARE_ '' , Eugenia said . STO
* `` _RARE_ Mae Evans said she didn't put a thing on her child but a _RARE_ _RARE_ until it was nine months old '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in New York , and I'm sick and tired of hearing about _RARE_ Mae Evans '' . STO
* `` Well now , Maggie , you don't have to snap at me '' , Eugenia said . STO
* `` I'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible '' . STO
* `` I'm sorry . STO
* I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money '' . STO
* `` Well , let's see . STO
* Let's make a list of your assets '' . STO
* Maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she couldn't stop , and she kept on laughing while she _RARE_ the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining . STO
* When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope _RARE_ down words and figures . STO
* `` I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working _RARE_ '' , Eugenia said . STO
* `` We could put up _RARE_ on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a _RARE_ where it's nice and _RARE_ , but of course it would _RARE_ quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that '' . STO
* `` What else '' ? STO
* `` You might set up a dress shop in the living room '' . STO
* `` Every woman in the block has tried that '' . STO
* `` What about a tea room , then ? STO
* You could set up tables in the front room and serve _RARE_ and your _RARE_ _RARE_ and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a _RARE_ and tell _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` It's too elaborate . STO
* And Grandma isn't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I '' . STO
* Eugenia sighed . STO
* She said , `` Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you don't like any of those I can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough '' . STO
* `` Oh , I'm sure I could do that '' , Maggie said . STO
* `` But it really wouldn't be fair , taking your jobs away from you '' . STO
* `` Don't worry , I can get plenty more '' , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could . STO
* Maggie was looking much _RARE_ already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so Eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it . STO
* `` And then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time . STO
* And I can go back to my _RARE_ and be thinking while I'm doing the washing '' . STO
* `` What are you going to do with your feet so you don't waste anything '' ? STO
* Maggie laughed . STO
* She said , `` Oh Eugenia , I wish '' `` What '' ? STO
* `` I wish I had three wishes '' , Maggie said . STO
* `` All of them for you '' . STO
* It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the _RARE_ of countless numbers of people . STO
* The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days . STO
* The cold settled like a tangible _RARE_ over the _RARE_ High City , locking it in an icy grip that _RARE_ its _RARE_ and altered its physical appearance ; ; it had a look of grim _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ other cities whose _RARE_ climate was cold , instead of the sprawling _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Western city _RARE_ in eternal _RARE_ at the foot of mountains stored with endless _RARE_ and resources . STO
* The _RARE_ huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in _RARE_ , in relief lines , outside government agencies . STO
* There weren't facilities to take care of them ; ; there never had been a need felt for such facilities . STO
* That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created _RARE_ with their stock markets and their _RARE_ populations and their _RARE_ _RARE_ of industries , protected by _RARE_ freight rates . STO
* The East was _RARE_ supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; ; and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay . STO
* The government offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold _RARE_ everything . STO
* _RARE_ , people talked and argued ; ; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate _RARE_ and something had to be done . STO
* Something had to be done ; ; it was the theme song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government . STO
* Something had to be done . STO
* The _RARE_ said it to each other a dozen times a day . STO
* Something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for _RARE_ , for clothes , for the new _RARE_ in the roof , for gas and light bills ; ; about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor _RARE_ that came up once , twice , fifty times a day . STO
* Just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ furnace _RARE_ fuel like a giant _RARE_ _RARE_ that had to be _RARE_ by _RARE_ tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold . STO
* Cold came in the _RARE_ cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around _RARE_ window _RARE_ , from the sleeping _RARE_ , the attic , from the _RARE_ cracks between _RARE_ on the roof . STO
* Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the _RARE_ and an electric heater in _RARE_ room . STO
* It was so cold and so _RARE_ that a sort of desperate _RARE_ _RARE_ all of them , like people _RARE_ or _RARE_ or caught in some other _RARE_ of circumstance so that time stood still and minor _RARE_ fell away and the only important thing was to _RARE_ together and survive . STO
* The _RARE_ burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their _RARE_ while they _RARE_ the _RARE_ . STO
* They lived mainly in the kitchen ; ; they moved _RARE_ bed and the baby's basket there , and the rest of them _RARE_ by the stove and ran _RARE_ and shivering to the upper _RARE_ regions and plunged into icy beds . STO
* Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to . STO
* `` You said a _RARE_ '' , Eugenia said grimly . STO
* Eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the _RARE_ of poverty wearing thin . STO
* She said to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to _RARE_ in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever . STO
* `` _RARE_ of people are poor all their lives '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ of people haven't our brains and talent '' . STO
* `` I know you when you start talking about brains and talent '' , Maggie said . STO
* `` You're working up to something , and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the _RARE_ family is superior to everything , even a depression '' . STO
* `` The only thing that worries me is how I'm going to prove it '' , Eugenia said . STO
* They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord _RARE_ it to be of _RARE_ than it would have to be that way . STO
* She didn't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater . STO
* Hope wouldn't hear of it , and she took the heater back to _RARE_ room , and Grandma took it back to _RARE_ room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma _RARE_ it over and almost set her _RARE_ on fire . STO
* She said that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it . STO
* Eugenia suspected her of deliberately _RARE_ the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in . STO
* `` _RARE_ of her to use it up . STO
* _RARE_ in a case like this , but '' -- `` You can joke ! STO
* Didn't you read it ? STO
* She's married that _RARE_ ! STO
* '' `` I read it , yes . STO
* This ought to simplify _RARE_ life '' . STO
* _RARE_ had more to say . STO
* Tolley had gone to live in California . STO
* He'd mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny had _RARE_ him for Roy Robards . STO
* `` It was plain as the nose on your face that they're laughing about it , _RARE_ . STO
* Zion stayed to get my pin , but it'll be a cold day in June when I go back '' . STO
* `` We will both go back , _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Kizzie turned to go inside . STO
* `` Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ right '' -- `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She swung around . STO
* `` What pictures '' ? STO
* `` In _RARE_ room ! STO
* You told me to bring my camera . STO
* I'm not going back '' -- `` Indeed you are ! STO
* Why should I want pictures of an empty room now ? STO
* Tolley had no idea of _RARE_ that _RARE_ little Jenny ! STO
* This -- trip of his had nothing to do with her _RARE_ with tenants , and I am going to see that everybody at _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ that simple fact . STO
* Wait for me , _RARE_ , I'll be dressed in half a second '' ! STO
* Frank followed her into the bedroom , _RARE_ her dress up the back . STO
* `` _RARE_ , Frank ! STO
* They're not going to laugh at the _RARE_ and _RARE_ very long ! STO
* _RARE_ going is my fault . STO
* I drove him away . STO
* You know it and I'll tell everybody exactly how it happened '' . STO
* She was so beautiful , so _RARE_ , so _RARE_ . STO
* He kissed her . STO
* `` Make your confession to God , Kizzie dear , not to the _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I'll decide that when I get there . STO
* I was so cruel to Tolley , so unfair . STO
* But I'll be fair now ! STO
* He is coming back , isn't he , Frank '' ? STO
* Yes , oh yes . STO
* What else was there to say ? STO
* _RARE_ to the _RARE_ he found some favorite lines from _RARE_ _RARE_ on his lips : `` Under the window in _RARE_ weather I marry this man and woman together . STO
* Let none but Him who rules the thunder Put this man and woman _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ for his lie ? STO
* He questioned God's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its _RARE_ , wondering why he had preserved it . STO
* If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it . STO
* In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining _RARE_ , making them parties to a _RARE_ _RARE_ his own . STO
* It was simply his necessity to _RARE_ which had made him write and keep this thing . STO
* `` You've told God , Frank '' , he said . STO
* `` Why _RARE_ the -- _RARE_ '' ? STO
* _RARE_ for an old clay pot , _RARE_ of _RARE_ days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little _RARE_ to flame , watching it _RARE_ , the red _RARE_ wax melting and _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace . STO
* `` ' And let me go , for the night _RARE_ me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit ' '' . STO
* A beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , _RARE_ , difficult not to _RARE_ a _RARE_ man , and perhaps he did . STO
* But there were great _RARE_ , even for a small man . STO
* Beyond his window were the _RARE_ trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life . STO
* There lay _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , his own young _RARE_ graves , but new life and promise for his _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* He poured his _RARE_ of wine for the toast he'd made so often . STO
* `` To absent loved ones '' . STO
* But this last time he drank not to _RARE_ but `` To Tolley '' ! STO
* Mr. Robards -- Jenny was the only person she knew of in the _RARE_ _RARE_ neighborhood who called him that -- was kind but too _RARE_ . STO
* It didn't bother him for everybody from the _RARE_ to the preacher to say , `` _RARE_ , Miss Jenny '' , adding a _RARE_ `` Roy '' , but it did her . STO
* He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again . STO
* _RARE_ call Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_ , and Dr. _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ Major Frank . STO
* Mr. Robards laughed , said he'd feel a damn fool , _RARE_ couldn't do that even to please her . STO
* `` You could try . STO
* And if I ever hear you say ' _RARE_ _RARE_ ' again I'll scream . STO
* And don't tell me you didn't at church Sunday . STO
* I heard you '' ! STO
* He really hadn't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr. Robards . STO
* How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and _RARE_ _RARE_ as to its beautiful _RARE_ , and fail her in -- spiritual ways . STO
* Another weakness -- far more _RARE_ than his manner of speaking , which he made only _RARE_ effort to change -- was his devotion to that old horse of _RARE_ . STO
* Her horse , rather . STO
* But Mr. _RARE_ now , oh my yes , indeed , yes ! STO
* He called her `` the _RARE_ '' much as Mrs. _RARE_ spoke of `` the _RARE_ , God _RARE_ her '' . STO
* He , with fifteen or twenty horses or _RARE_ or _RARE_ or _RARE_ out there in the barn , was _RARE_ only of `` the _RARE_ '' , `` the _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , the _RARE_ Gunny . STO
* For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this _RARE_ without price _RARE_ _RARE_ around in her stall . STO
* And what had happened ? STO
* Gunny invariably tried to bite her . STO
* _RARE_ , Mr. Robards said , just a _RARE_ anyway . STO
* `` _RARE_ back , Miss Jen , she's _RARE_ of your _RARE_ '' . STO
* Never , `` _RARE_ that , you _RARE_ devil '' ! STO
* Never concern for his wife's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January . STO
* She _RARE_ _RARE_ Gunny whose _RARE_ was due then too ! STO
* _RARE_ for hours to his _RARE_ that the war and `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his _RARE_ of _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ to come , Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it . STO
* Gunny _RARE_ so much that was _RARE_ -- Tolley , the indifference with which the _RARE_ and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her _RARE_ swollen stomach . STO
* _RARE_ birth was no _RARE_ to Mr. Robards . STO
* _RARE_ was a fine _RARE_ and could get here quick , he suggested . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ to having Dr. _RARE_ , a former _RARE_ , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her . STO
* The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure . STO
* He would be in the barn , or riding for the _RARE_ ! STO
* Night after night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with _RARE_ of expensive _RARE_ , _RARE_ over her _RARE_ _RARE_ as the cook did over _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house . STO
* Yet when the dear baby came , he had _RARE_ over here in a _RARE_ , and was as _RARE_ and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been . STO
* Jenny wished now that she had had Dr. _RARE_ , feeling that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby to turn into _RARE_ . STO
* There was something not nice about _RARE_ , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted , saying , `` You don't see _RARE_ _RARE_ down the _RARE_ _RARE_ day , Miss Jen , _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ 'em up _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' _RARE_ for her mother , she said firmly , _RARE_ , for herself , and -- `` _RARE_ , for Miss Kizzie '' , he suggested . STO
* `` She was mighty good to you past times , an' _RARE_ _RARE_ her '' . STO
* Now she must be thinking of a _RARE_ , something special . STO
* Just wait till she saw the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ in all Kentucky . STO
* Strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old . STO
* What about _RARE_ Robards ? STO
* `` Why don't you name him Jesus Christ ! STO
* '' She burst into tears . STO
* Roy was deeply _RARE_ . STO
* He'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet _RARE_ had been . STO
* Of course she wasn't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it . STO
* He had a good idea why not . STO
* Those _RARE_ `` At Home '' cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all _RARE_ up , hadn't brought many _RARE_ in two whole months . STO
* Doc _RARE_ and Miss _RARE_ had come . STO
* So had Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his _RARE_ _RARE_ last year , saying how much she enjoyed her _RARE_ house in town in _RARE_ weather , was looking forward to _RARE_ _RARE_ this summer . STO
* There was an idea . STO
* Miss Kizzie had been right _RARE_ ever since they were married , though you'd have thought a _RARE_ would have brought her round . STO
* Oh , she'd come to see them once , left silver _RARE_ _RARE_ for all of the trips . STO
* But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss _RARE_ couldn't have been very _RARE_ , for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there . STO
* More and more , these days , she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to _RARE_ and Nick's -- his own old square frame box on _RARE_ , chickens and cats and _RARE_ under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a _RARE_ over the babies dressed like _RARE_ . STO
* Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the _RARE_ house in the land , too . STO
* It made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss _RARE_ had given him , to be told by Miss _RARE_ that her _RARE_ _RARE_ was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she _RARE_ it , they would be unable to _RARE_ Mrs. Robards and the children . STO
* She hoped they were well . STO
* He didn't tell Miss Jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those _RARE_ _RARE_ , and she really took a fit . STO
* If he ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame . STO
* `` Have a party an' leave 'em out , _RARE_ '' , he suggested . STO
* `` A _RARE_ party , send an _RARE_ to _RARE_ but them -- those folks you met at the _RARE_ House , the ones I've got to know in this new _RARE_ Club affair , the whole _RARE_ neighborhood . STO
* We'll have _RARE_ -- couple _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in a crowd any time . STO
* I'll see word gets round '' . STO
* `` Don't you dare ! STO
* '' Miss Jen was funny that way , funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and _RARE_ up . STO
* He was _RARE_ worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try . STO
* Zion was surprised when _RARE_ _RARE_ stopped beside her on the _RARE_ one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that _RARE_ _RARE_ had had a call to _RARE_ in some mountain town . STO
* Roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to _RARE_ in , and he'd give her a lift to _RARE_ . STO
* Her _RARE_ was only _RARE_ and she hoped he didn't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on . STO
* `` See for yourself , Miss Zion . STO
* It won't take a minute '' . STO
* He swung in through his own wide _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ you ever did see , but Miss Jen gets mighty _RARE_ . STO
* She'll _RARE_ the sight of a friendly face . STO
* Miss _RARE_ won't care your _RARE_ , will she '' ? STO
* `` Why of course not '' , Zion said _RARE_ . STO
* `` He must have _RARE_ me '' , Henrietta murmured to the room . STO
* The _RARE_ of Doaty's last will and _RARE_ was proof enough of that ; ; Doaty would never have left her house to a _RARE_ woman . STO
* She found herself _RARE_ an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the _RARE_ , sorry note and her best _RARE_ pin . STO
* Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her _RARE_ . STO
* Henrietta thought , It's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us . STO
* There had been more to know about _RARE_ , inevitably , and most of it _RARE_ . STO
* Adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently _RARE_ . STO
* Their childhood would have been quite _RARE_ without _RARE_ _RARE_ for drama , especially through the long summers . STO
* In winter , in the city , there had been the _RARE_ School , which taught _RARE_ with a kind of _RARE_ passion for knowledge ; ; there had been lessons in French from a small Polish _RARE_ with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; ; there had been the dancing class -- Miss _RARE_ , thin and _RARE_ , with her _RARE_ _RARE_ and her _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* There had been supper parties and _RARE_ , _RARE_ and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously _RARE_ , enormously _RARE_ , the sun around which the _RARE_ planets _RARE_ . STO
* Mama had died before the _RARE_ of the family circle , the _RARE_ of Charles . STO
* It was safe to assume that Papa , _RARE_ heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` Thank God your poor mother was _RARE_ this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in _RARE_ hand , just because her `` poor mother '' was gone already and would never know . STO
* Mama was vulnerable ; ; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her . STO
* But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta . STO
* She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice . STO
* Only at this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty's bed -- she found herself _RARE_ how others might regard her . STO
* Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice . STO
* She turned on her side , finding the idea _RARE_ . STO
* If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him ? STO
* _RARE_ to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone . STO
* No _RARE_ , no sin . STO
* No _RARE_ , no virtue ? STO
* A curious thought to end a curious night . STO
* The birds were really awake now in a _RARE_ of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching _RARE_ and door , table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers in their artificial _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Before anything else , she would go to Doaty's grave with flowers from Doaty's forgotten garden . STO
* Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a _RARE_ whose nature avoided _RARE_ . STO
* She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls . STO
* It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray . STO
* After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window . STO
* The garden below was _RARE_ with _RARE_ and enchanting in its small _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ out , she could see a _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , one not quite come to _RARE_ , one just beyond it . STO
* On a thrusting spray thick with _RARE_ and _RARE_ and swelling pink _RARE_ , like a summer _RARE_ , a bird balanced and _RARE_ , _RARE_ brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song . STO
* It was so pretty and _RARE_ that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was _RARE_ not a child but _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ certain age . STO
* _RARE_ suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite _RARE_ and went downstairs . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ , was not yet up and about , _RARE_ that _RARE_ was human . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday _RARE_ and milk in a white _RARE_ , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot . STO
* Outside , the garden , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , yielded a _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ , sweet _RARE_ , scented stock and _RARE_ _RARE_ , which she tied with long _RARE_ and took back to show _RARE_ , who was now stirring about the kitchen and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ came _RARE_ to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , _RARE_ the air with _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Henrietta held her _RARE_ out of reach and said it was for Doaty . STO
* `` _RARE_ in the _RARE_ '' , said _RARE_ coldly . STO
* `` Go change your shoes before you turn around '' . STO
* She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta _RARE_ her under the clear impression that she could either _RARE_ or stay home . STO
* _RARE_ danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door . STO
* To a _RARE_ , there was only one church . STO
* The cemetery _RARE_ just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea . STO
* For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its _RARE_ shops just stirring and its inhabitants _RARE_ her with the _RARE_ curiosity . STO
* She smiled and bowed , _RARE_ the _RARE_ feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child . STO
* Now , some of the _RARE_ were _RARE_ , but all were interested . STO
* An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than _RARE_ look as she passed , the _RARE_ still plainly rising in his branches . STO
* On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning . STO
* He _RARE_ his ear and shook his head at her repetition , _RARE_ in a _RARE_ way that he had heard her the first time . STO
* He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ been slow to come '' , he said . STO
* `` It's my _RARE_ out time '' . STO
* He _RARE_ at her flowers . STO
* `` I'm taking them to the cemetery '' , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of _RARE_ . STO
* `` They'll be _RARE_ me next '' , he said pleasantly , `` but not so _RARE_ they plan . STO
* See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin . STO
* It's _RARE_ myself out that does it '' . STO
* He regarded her with rising hope . STO
* `` You'd like to hear how I go about it '' . STO
* `` It's nice of you '' , Henrietta said _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ welcome '' . STO
* He straightened himself , _RARE_ against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots . STO
* His stick _RARE_ to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a _RARE_ for _RARE_ the _RARE_ aspects of his text . STO
* `` Every month , _RARE_ three days '' , he said happily , `` I take no water into my system , no water whatsoever . STO
* It rests the tissues '' . STO
* Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her _RARE_ good sense . STO
* `` _RARE_ the tissues '' , he said , `` and _RARE_ the system . STO
* My _RARE_ did it , and he lived to a great age '' . STO
* He looked up at her sharply . STO
* `` Don't remember , do you '' ? STO
* She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old _RARE_ , who must have been in his _RARE_ when Henrietta ran away . STO
* Next to the _RARE_ , _RARE_ had owned the island most , and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him , _RARE_ by his terrible years -- a _RARE_ man with a thin beard and very _RARE_ blue eyes like a _RARE_ , more aged than possible . STO
* He had never spoken once to the _RARE_ sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a _RARE_ captain and powerful like the sea . STO
* It must be that son who sat before her now , _RARE_ to half his size and half his senses . STO
* She said gently , `` Of course I remember you '' . STO
* `` Not so _RARE_ I remember you '' , he said . STO
* `` _RARE_ the young _RARE_ woman . STO
* _RARE_ away on a black night with a _RARE_ _RARE_ man . STO
* I know all about you '' . STO
* `` You do seem to '' , said Henrietta , impressed . STO
* `` Can't blame a man for _RARE_ his wife '' , he said quite _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ mine many a time , only she never knew it . STO
* Man in a boat , there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit . STO
* Any harm in that '' ? STO
* `` Probably '' , said Henrietta _RARE_ . STO
* He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her _RARE_ . STO
* `` You'd be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had their own laws . STO
* Only , this old man's _RARE_ was even less to her taste than _RARE_ _RARE_ open _RARE_ . STO
* Well , she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , _RARE_ or condemned . STO
* She had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow . STO
* She started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a _RARE_ , _RARE_ figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress . STO
* She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man . STO
* `` You've not had your breakfast yet , _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ is no breakfast '' , he said . STO
* `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his _RARE_ and _RARE_ on the _RARE_ . STO
* `` He's _RARE_ today '' , his _RARE_ said wearily , and bent to pick it up . STO
* `` He's got this idea about drying out '' `` It ain't an idea '' ! STO
* `` If it ain't an idea '' , she said , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water '' ? STO
* He looked _RARE_ to heaven and said , `` _RARE_ don't affect the tissues none '' , and the ingenious _RARE_ of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she _RARE_ him his _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* His _RARE_ sighed . STO
* `` Come on , do . STO
* The children are eating , and Miss _RARE_ on her way _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` To the _RARE_ . STO
* Who ain't '' ? STO
* `` Not me . STO
* I've got a day's work to do . STO
* -- You'll be visiting Miss Doaty , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Henrietta nodded . STO
* How much they knew about her ! STO
* The woman ( she must have been a tiny baby when _RARE_ and _RARE_ had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small ) answered the nod with her own . STO
* `` God rest her soul , she was a sweet one . STO
* Come on now '' . STO
* She put a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle _RARE_ and necessary _RARE_ that the young show toward the very old . STO
* He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , _RARE_ _RARE_ to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was _RARE_ about by those who still had their wicked strength . STO
* There was a _RARE_ of voices from _RARE_ , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of _RARE_ from the old man . STO
* Henrietta looked down at her _RARE_ , still _RARE_ with its color and scent , and set her feet on their _RARE_ way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , _RARE_ dancing ahead of her . STO
* At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , _RARE_ with fat round bushes like sheep . STO
* They were covered with tiny white _RARE_ , their _RARE_ roots _RARE_ at the _RARE_ ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the _RARE_ and cry . STO
* The air was full of sounds too but _RARE_ ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky . STO
* She felt _RARE_ , walking , and almost easy until the church _RARE_ told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty . STO
* Both church and _RARE_ were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had _RARE_ while she was gone away ) but the _RARE_ had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' seemed suddenly impossible . STO
* She sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with _RARE_ , her fingers tracing the _RARE_ _RARE_ letters _RARE_ with green _RARE_ . STO
* The day's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her _RARE_ , if only to shade Doaty's flowers . STO
* A small , _RARE_ angel watched her from a nearby _RARE_ , the only angel in the cemetery . STO
* She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and _RARE_ clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ family had come from _RARE_ _RARE_ , in the _RARE_ of the main Japanese island of _RARE_ , where there are still _RARE_ of the mysterious _RARE_ strain . STO
* The _RARE_ were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal _RARE_ of the Japanese came from Southern Asia . STO
* Apparently they were of _RARE_ blood . STO
* They had white _RARE_ and blue eyes ; ; all their men were _RARE_ , and many of their women were beautiful . STO
* A _RARE_ few of them are left now , to _RARE_ mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient _RARE_ _RARE_ , which have the same haunting _RARE_ as the _RARE_ of the American Indians . STO
* Most of them have been _RARE_ , but sometimes a man in _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ is much more _RARE_ than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her _RARE_ warmed and improved by a little of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ from the South . STO
* Tommy _RARE_ was one of these fortunate occasions . STO
* She was taller than most Japanese girls , and had the _RARE_ _RARE_ form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall . STO
* Her nose was higher of bridge , her _RARE_ so pale as to be quite _RARE_ to sunburn , and the fish and _RARE_ diet of her _RARE_ had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong . STO
* Her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about . STO
* She had black eyes , long and _RARE_ tilted , and the way she walked was melody . STO
* She had been in Japan just one week . STO
* It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ; she was already considering putting in _RARE_ _RARE_ for duty at San Diego , _RARE_ , the Great _RARE_ , _RARE_ -- any place the Navy had a hospital -- with a threat to _RARE_ her commission if the request were not granted . STO
* _RARE_ would be better than the land of her _RARE_ . STO
* There was nothing wrong with her job . STO
* Tommy had been assigned to the _RARE_ ward . STO
* There were no _RARE_ serious cases : the ward doctor sometimes _RARE_ up with the _RARE_ to serve as a marriage _RARE_ -- sometimes the Navy sent people back to the States to preserve a marriage -- but mental health as a rule was very high . STO
* At present the doctor's main concern was in seeing to it that Japanese _RARE_ firms were not permitted to operate on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ sunk too close _RARE_ , because the work involved setting off _RARE_ _RARE_ at all hours . STO
* Tommy was interested in _RARE_ , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients . STO
* But she suffered in her _RARE_ hours . STO
* Such as now , when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the _RARE_ Club , having coffee and a _RARE_ to sustain her until _RARE_ . STO
* She had changed into a _RARE_ dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck . STO
* This was one of the Navy's crossroads -- you find them all around the world . STO
* _RARE_ from the West Coast rotated on _RARE_ _RARE_ of duty with the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ was the _RARE_ _RARE_ principal _RARE_ for maintenance , _RARE_ and shore liberty . STO
* _RARE_ or later , all the gray Navy ships came in here ; ; if Tommy sat long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in San Diego and Long Beach . STO
* And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there . STO
* She felt , rather than saw , the approach of the _RARE_ young man . STO
* He came through from the _RARE_ Bar , which was stag , with the ice _RARE_ _RARE_ in a glass he carried . STO
* When he saw Tommy sitting alone , the _RARE_ sound stopped . STO
* He was perhaps a trifle _RARE_ , having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted , and consequently out of practice ; ; he wore a brown _RARE_ sports jacket obviously _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ , and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant . STO
* Probably off one of the _RARE_ -- an _RARE_ . STO
* There was a _RARE_ chance , perhaps , that he would be _RARE_ , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different . STO
* Japan did something to a man -- and it wasn't just Japan , either , because the same thing applied anywhere overseas . STO
* It was as if foreign duty implied and _RARE_ license ; ; it _RARE_ that the folks at home would never know about it , and , therefore , why not ? STO
* Then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He said , turning on what was meant to be charm . STO
* `` You _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* Maybe you _RARE_ date with me '' ? STO
* `` I beg your pardon '' ! STO
* Tommy said out of her cold rage . STO
* `` I don't believe I know you , and I can't understand your quaint brand of English -- it was meant to be English , wasn't it '' ? STO
* The _RARE_ young officer fell back on his heels , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* At least , he had the decency to _RARE_ , she thought . STO
* `` Oh -- I'm sorry ! STO
* You see , I thought -- I mean I really had no idea '' -- `` Oh , yes -- you had ideas '' ! STO
* Tommy interrupted furiously . STO
* `` All wrong ones '' ! STO
* Then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture , and dropped into Navy _RARE_ . STO
* `` Take off , _RARE_ '' ! STO
* `` _RARE_ -- sorry '' ! STO
* He muttered , and took off , obviously feeling like a fool . STO
* The trouble was that there was no _RARE_ satisfaction in this for Tommy . STO
* She felt like a fool , too . STO
* It hadn't been this way in college , or in _RARE_ training ; ; it wasn't this way in the hospital at San Diego . STO
* Everybody had accepted her for what she was -- a very charming girl . STO
* Nobody had addressed her in broken English at any of those places , nobody had suggested that she wasn't American . STO
* There are Spanish girls who look like Tommy _RARE_ , _RARE_ with a _RARE_ hint of the _RARE_ in their faces ; ; there are _RARE_ from the _RARE_ states who are similarly _RARE_ , and -- back in the _RARE_ United States -- they were regarded simply as pretty women . STO
* Now , having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for , Tommy was being _RARE_ at every turn . STO
* She looked around , _RARE_ . STO
* Four little Japanese _RARE_ were _RARE_ the English language at the counter -- _RARE_ _RARE_ happened to be one of them . STO
* Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* For a steak sandwich , or `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* For one cup of coffee . STO
* Two other Japanese girls were sitting at the tables , both quite pretty and well _RARE_ . STO
* One was with a _RARE_ and _RARE_ lieutenant commander ; ; the other was with her American husband and their _RARE_ _RARE_ children . STO
* Seeing these did nothing for _RARE_ mood . STO
* She told herself _RARE_ , and with pride , I am an American ! STO
* And so she was , and would remain . STO
* But she was learning that so long as she was in this country , and wore civilian dress in the Club , there would always be _RARE_ young men who would approach her with broken English . STO
* There had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good Japanese . STO
* Tommy wouldn't know ; ; after coming to America , her parents had spoken only English . STO
* One thing was becoming increasingly sure . STO
* She had been sent to the wrong place for duty . STO
* There was more to service in the Navy _RARE_ Corps than the hours in the ward . STO
* One had to have friends , and a _RARE_ life in _RARE_ hours . STO
* Now there was _RARE_ male singing from the _RARE_ Bar . STO
* It was terribly off key , and poorly done , and Tommy could never admit to herself that male _RARE_ was a very natural and important thing , but all at once she felt _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* She finished her _RARE_ and drank her coffee and paid her check ; ; she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated . STO
* _RARE_ while angry had given her a slight _RARE_ . STO
* Back in her living quarters at the hospital she took _RARE_ of _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* Then , after a while , she went to her mirror . STO
* It was all true . STO
* She certainly looked Japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men . STO
* And , still , they did not have to be so crude in their approach . STO
* There was a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone cheerful . STO
* She promised that she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen , on the island of _RARE_ -- which was not very far from _RARE_ . STO
* And tomorrow she would take time to shop for the _RARE_ her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown . STO
* Tommy , of course , had never heard of a _RARE_ , or Japanese _RARE_ , which says , `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , and is literally translated as `` _RARE_ are better than _RARE_ '' . STO
* Actually , this is only another way of saying that blood is _RARE_ than water . STO
* Doc _RARE_ scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing , because the discipline _RARE_ there is ordinarily for the young and _RARE_ , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report . STO
* But the beer hall _RARE_ in _RARE_ had been unusual , too , and _RARE_ _RARE_ was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Just why anybody should wish to start a _RARE_ the executive officer didn't know . STO
* In his opinion , Doc had not grown up . STO
* The lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief . STO
* There had never been a good reason for Doc _RARE_ to grow up . STO
* He had come into the Navy too young , with the image of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ before him . STO
* The war found him much too early , and its _RARE_ -- and especially its awful boredom -- were best forgotten in _RARE_ and elaborate practical jokes , and even now Doc had never found any _RARE_ , _RARE_ influence . STO
* He remained young at heart , with an _RARE_ sense of humor . STO
* He _RARE_ about the captain's _RARE_ of new men , took great delight in _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ , and gave no thought for tomorrow . STO
* He was doing thirty years , and the Navy would take care of him . STO
* The job security enjoyed by Doc _RARE_ , and nearly all members of the Armed Forces , is a wonderful thing . STO
* Actually , all a man in uniform has to do is to get by . STO
* He may not rise to the heights , but he can get by , and eventually be retired . STO
* Doc had been under restriction to the ship since the _RARE_ left _RARE_ . STO
* This deprived him of liberty in _RARE_ _RARE_ , but he told _RARE_ _RARE_ that _RARE_ _RARE_ was a book he had read before , and the Navy would always bring him there again , some day . STO
* At _RARE_ he was restricted to the _RARE_ of the Base because _RARE_ _RARE_ , being thoughtful , knew that Doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the _RARE_ Base . STO
* This gave Doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well . STO
* There were two things he wanted to do : inspect one of the many _RARE_ that had been dug into the hills on the Naval Base , and visit an old _RARE_ . STO
* A telephone line had been _RARE_ up to _RARE_ the ship with the Base exchange . STO
* After supper , Doc called Whitey _RARE_ , who was now a lieutenant and had a family . STO
* `` Well , Doc , you old _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Whitey exclaimed , with true affection . STO
* `` Come over and have a drink . STO
* We live down by the Base _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ a taxi '' . STO
* `` I'll be there , but I'll walk '' , Doc said . STO
* `` I've got to run an errand on the way . STO
* See you in about an hour '' . STO
* He threw a smart _RARE_ at the _RARE_ , went up the _RARE_ , and turned down the wide street in front of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Club . STO
* How , he wondered , does one enjoy one's spare time ? STO
* He considered some interesting _RARE_ but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk . STO
* Then there was exercise , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , which was not only good for you but also made you more _RARE_ : the thought of _RARE_ activity left him exhausted . STO
* Perhaps golf , with a _RARE_ companion -- but he'd lost his _RARE_ , hadn't played in years . STO
* There was swimming over at the Riverside Hotel , but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a _RARE_ . STO
* Perhaps a packing trip into the _RARE_ , let his beard grow -- but that was too _RARE_ . STO
* I could , he thought , take a long walk -- but where ? STO
* The telephone rang . STO
* `` You missed it '' , _RARE_ voice said , `` You should have gone over to the _RARE_ _RARE_ with us . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , but _RARE_ , and _RARE_ Williams and her _RARE_ band '' . STO
* `` Hi , Buzz '' , Owen said . STO
* `` I went over to the _RARE_ and dropped two notes '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , Buzz said , `` Listen , we're having a stag dinner over at the _RARE_ _RARE_ on Friday . STO
* Imagine a stag dinner with _RARE_ Williams '' . STO
* He laughed and laughed . STO
* Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn't come to _RARE_ for stag dinners . STO
* `` Thanks '' , Owen said , `` but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen '' . STO
* Buzz was a _RARE_ _RARE_ who never let his _RARE_ rest . STO
* When Owen was finally rid of him , there was a _RARE_ _RARE_ at the door . STO
* `` Yes '' , Owen called out . STO
* `` Yes '' ? STO
* `` I'm Mrs. Gertrude Parker '' , a soft voice explained , `` And I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes , please '' . STO
* _RARE_ , he thought , a _RARE_ _RARE_ at last . STO
* Probably saw me in the lobby . STO
* He was disappointed to find a nervous , _RARE_ woman with a big hat standing at the door . STO
* She frowned at his green _RARE_ with the yellow _RARE_ . STO
* `` How do you do '' ? STO
* She said , _RARE_ . STO
* `` Our church is _RARE_ a group of very _RARE_ women up in Alaska . STO
* We call them _RARE_ and they go among the _RARE_ making friends and bringing the light . STO
* They're up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them '' . STO
* `` Oh '' ? STO
* `` You see '' , she said , looking past him into the room , where the _RARE_ glasses _RARE_ _RARE_ in the bright light , `` you and I can't understand the many _RARE_ they have to _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Why is that '' ? STO
* She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction . STO
* _RARE_ , Owen thought , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* There was a slight nervous _RARE_ in the region of her left eye . STO
* It gave her a _RARE_ , winking effect . STO
* `` Have you ever tried to reason with an _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She asked , winking wildly . STO
* `` They are a very difficult group of people '' . STO
* `` I don't know much about them '' , Owen admitted , `` but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably _RARE_ outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do '' . STO
* She smiled in a _RARE_ fashion . STO
* `` You know , that's very interesting . STO
* People don't know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that . STO
* The more _RARE_ I do , the more I note how far most people are from their personal God '' . STO
* _RARE_ , Owen kept his peace . STO
* What would happen next ? STO
* That she was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch ? STO
* Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice . STO
* `` How did you get by the desk '' ? STO
* He asked curiously . STO
* `` I'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're wandering around the _RARE_ , knocking on _RARE_ doors and talking down _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Oh , I just come once a week . STO
* Every day I visit a different hotel . STO
* I feel it's my duty . STO
* I do this work all on my own , because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these _RARE_ . STO
* Do you know these women go all through Alaska , and they don't have the proper facilities ? STO
* They travel in pairs as much as a _RARE_ miles a day '' . STO
* `` Do you have any idea how far I travel every day ? STO
* I have the whole Pacific Northwest '' . STO
* Owen was aware he was getting _RARE_ but he couldn't help himself . STO
* Mrs. Gertrude Parker drew back . STO
* `` That's hardly a Christian approach '' , she _RARE_ . STO
* `` You're in the _RARE_ world '' . STO
* `` I didn't say it was Christian . STO
* I don't think you'll find many active Christian salesmen . STO
* Not that religion isn't big business ; ; those _RARE_ and prayer books make a lot of money for _RARE_ houses , but they don't get top personnel . STO
* Our key salesmen are in _RARE_ and cosmetics '' . STO
* `` God , I take it , plays no part in this '' , she said _RARE_ . STO
* `` God doesn't have any _RARE_ or cosmetics '' , he said _RARE_ before he caught himself . STO
* It sounded silly ; ; why go on ? STO
* More people were passing ; ; he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation . STO
* `` And whiskey '' , she said , smiling and _RARE_ at the _RARE_ glasses . STO
* `` Don't forget whiskey ; ; it's such a big _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` You know '' , he said , getting a grip on himself , `` I think you're going to have to excuse me . STO
* I have an appointment '' . STO
* `` I can imagine '' , she said . STO
* `` Probably down at the bar . STO
* But what do you want to do about the _RARE_ ? STO
* They must be freezing up there now . STO
* Can't you help them '' ? STO
* `` Leave a card or something . STO
* I'll think it over '' . STO
* `` I have no card '' , she said bitterly . STO
* `` You haven't been listening to what I've been telling you . STO
* I only hope my talking to you has helped you a little , anyway , because you need spiritual _RARE_ '' . STO
* She looked _RARE_ , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race . STO
* She stood _RARE_ for a moment , then walked down the hall ; ; he heard her knocking on another door . STO
* It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; ; then he realized he was hungry . STO
* He _RARE_ , shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast . STO
* On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail . STO
* There was a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic _RARE_ on new lines they always issued . STO
* His lawyer had sent him a statement on his _RARE_ _RARE_ , and there was a letter from the _RARE_ of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's _RARE_ . STO
* He ate breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walked out onto Virginia Street , he felt _RARE_ . STO
* He looked off to the crest of the _RARE_ , still _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ River made a wide _RARE_ . STO
* He felt suddenly _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* With any luck at all he could easily find a _RARE_ . STO
* Although it was only three o'clock , he stopped in at the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The tables were all spinning , the dice rattling , the bar crowded . STO
* Just to test himself , he played _RARE_ for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had won , surprisingly , twenty dollars . STO
* The way was opening up ; ; when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ was dimly lit with shaded neon . STO
* There were more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a _RARE_ . STO
* They all had the hard look of _RARE_ who had stopped dreaming , who automatically turned the cards , hardly caring what showed up . STO
* The _RARE_ around the wall depicted early _RARE_ in covered wagons , who appeared much more _RARE_ than the _RARE_ . STO
* The women had a bright shining _RARE_ as they leaned out from the wall and gazed _RARE_ into the distance , while the men were stern but hopeful . STO
* All , of course , except the _RARE_ party who were bent on _RARE_ to death . STO
* `` I wonder if they did eat each other at the end '' , Owen _RARE_ . STO
* He sat down next to a _RARE_ blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes . STO
* She sighed a dirty word and left . STO
* Owen was surprised to see Mrs. Gertrude Parker playing the _RARE_ _RARE_ that were _RARE_ arranged by the entrance . STO
* She sat down and played two _RARE_ at once , looking grim , as if _RARE_ by mechanical devices , and Owen felt sorry for the _RARE_ depending on her support . STO
* A _RARE_ cowboy sat down next to him in the _RARE_ place . STO
* He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the _RARE_ . STO
* `` What you need is a steady _RARE_ '' , the cowboy announced after watching Owen play . STO
* `` You can't build on your _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` What are you playing '' ? STO
* Owen asked . STO
* `` I'm just _RARE_ '' , the cowboy explained . STO
* `` I keep all these plays in this little black book , and I watch over a _RARE_ period to find out what numbers are repeating . STO
* But _RARE_ not my game . STO
* I'm always trying to find a breaking table in _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , I'm pretty famous in these parts : I'm called The _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ to know you . STO
* Don't you have to spend any time on your ranch '' ? STO
* `` Well , of course I do . STO
* I'm with the _RARE_ , pushing a horse called _RARE_ . STO
* He's my own horse , and what I collect from him I use on _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ can rack and _RARE_ and he's the _RARE_ thing in _RARE_ County . STO
* I figure if I can get any kind of publicity campaign going , I'll land him on TV -- you know , one of those favorite horses for some Western hero . STO
* I once trained a horse for _RARE_ _RARE_ , but nothing like _RARE_ . STO
* He's a _RARE_ and he photographs _RARE_ '' . STO
* Five came up while Owen was listening to The _RARE_ and he neglected to play , a loss of ten dollars . STO
* This proved conclusively that The _RARE_ was a _RARE_ , so he walked on down to _RARE_ , an even more _RARE_ gambling _RARE_ than the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* When he looked in the back , Mrs. Gertrude Parker was _RARE_ _RARE_ cards . STO
* His _RARE_ spirit had _RARE_ ; ; he studied the pistol exhibition that _RARE_ _RARE_ as an added attraction . STO
* He _RARE_ a long redhead with green eyes , but she was a _RARE_ with her money in front of her . STO
* He had no great prejudice against _RARE_ ; ; it just seemed such a dry run . STO
* There was no cash around ; ; everyone was _RARE_ silver dollars . STO
* The management _RARE_ _RARE_ the green stuff into the office and gave the customers _RARE_ or checks or _RARE_ points . STO
* He read a special announcement whereby _RARE_ would feature a special _RARE_ at three A.M. _RARE_ _RARE_ ( The _RARE_ ) Brenner and fourteen _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He wondered if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him . STO
* He passed two _RARE_ , both wearing _RARE_ , and they made him feel a little sad . STO
* Owen found Buzz watching _RARE_ . STO
* Buzz had on a _RARE_ shirt and was carrying some _RARE_ oil and dark glasses . STO
* He was shorter and _RARE_ than Owen , who felt good standing next to him . STO
* `` We're all going over to Lake _RARE_ and try our luck at _RARE_ '' , Buzz explained , still _RARE_ . STO
* `` We ran into a guy at the _RARE_ _RARE_ who guarantees we can beat the wheel . STO
* He started out as a _RARE_ , then became a pit boss until the Club found him _RARE_ . STO
* He was knocking down checks at _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I'm _RARE_ to _RARE_ '' , Owen explained . STO
* `` Something about the pollen '' . STO
* `` Well , okay '' , Buzz said . STO
* `` We'll see you around later '' . STO
* Owen went over to the _RARE_ table and the dice were hot , but he couldn't _RARE_ with any _RARE_ success . STO
* `` How's your luck , honey '' ? STO
* A short _RARE_ blonde in a bursting _RARE_ addressed him . STO
* She looked _RARE_ and _RARE_ , but he didn't get the impression he was being _RARE_ the way he'd been hoping . STO
* `` I haven't had any luck since I was a baby '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ me '' , she said , `` and let me at those dice . STO
* I'll make them dance the _RARE_ . STO
* We'll get it in a hurry and get it out '' . STO
* `` Let's have a drink and discuss a merger '' . STO
* `` If you go broke '' , she said , smiling up at him , `` I'll leave you '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ like real love '' , Owen said . STO
* `` It sort of brings a lump to my throat '' . STO
* `` My _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , the blonde said after she ordered a _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ after the ballet . STO
* My mother wanted to call me _RARE_ , but it sounded too affected '' . STO
* Spencer said nothing . STO
* `` Is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ? STO
* Spencer shook his head . STO
* Alexander said , `` _RARE_ me properly , Spencer '' . STO
* Spencer was quiet for a moment longer , then he said , `` There is nothing I want to say , Captain '' . STO
* `` Very well '' . STO
* Alexander walked away . STO
* Naval procedure , he thought , had its moments of grim humor . STO
* Philip Spencer had _RARE_ planned the murder of his captain , yet it seemed in order to _RARE_ him for a _RARE_ of proper address . STO
* During the morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of Spencer was having no _RARE_ effect upon the men of the Somers . STO
* Those named in the Greek paper were manufacturing reasons to _RARE_ _RARE_ under _RARE_ of some call of duty , so as to be near Spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort . STO
* The two met in the _RARE_ cabin . STO
* `` What is the next step , Captain '' ? STO
* `` More _RARE_ , I fear '' . STO
* In your opinion , who is this E. _RARE_ on the ' certain ' list '' ? STO
* `` Cromwell , of course . STO
* He is the oldest and most experienced of the lot . STO
* He saw the dangers , not the _RARE_ of being identified as a _RARE_ . STO
* Somehow he talked Spencer into letting him use another name '' . STO
* There was a tap at the door and _RARE_ entered with the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain . STO
* `` Have him come in '' . STO
* Heiser , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , brought the _RARE_ news that the _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ had been _RARE_ removed from their customary places . STO
* `` And also , sir , two articles which were considered _RARE_ now must be regarded in another light entirely . STO
* An African knife and _RARE_ are at this moment being _RARE_ by McKinley and Green . STO
* McKinley was _RARE_ to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer's possession and that '' -- `` Where did you gather all this information , Heiser ? STO
* Who reported to you the disappearance of _RARE_ and _RARE_ and who '' -- He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with Gansevoort and Heiser behind him . STO
* A glance revealed that the main _RARE_ mast had been carried away . STO
* The _RARE_ milling about of what had been a _RARE_ , _RARE_ crew struck Alexander with horror . STO
* He bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads _RARE_ toward the _RARE_ figure as though for further instruction . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ side . STO
* `` _RARE_ violently jerked the _RARE_ brace with full intention to carry away the mast . STO
* I saw him myself and it was done after _RARE_ with Cromwell . STO
* I swear it , sir '' . STO
* And it was clear that _RARE_ was not mistaken , for both _RARE_ and Cromwell took no step toward _RARE_ in the sending up of the new _RARE_ mast till Philip Spencer had given the signal to _RARE_ . STO
* Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work . STO
* Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and _RARE_ . STO
* Their strategy was sound enough and , he _RARE_ , had been _RARE_ only by Philip Spencer's _RARE_ to _RARE_ an idea he had not originated . STO
* When the mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for _RARE_ and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in _RARE_ sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers . STO
* Spencer's potential followers were openly sullen and _RARE_ , missing _RARE_ without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their _RARE_ at the prisoners being kept in _RARE_ , _RARE_ with the three by glance and signal . STO
* One of the missing _RARE_ came out of its hiding place after _RARE_ _RARE_ had been _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ Wilson . STO
* _RARE_ had reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by Wilson , _RARE_ the weapon . STO
* Wilson , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , _RARE_ and McKinley . STO
* Not a man on the _RARE_ , loyal or _RARE_ , could be _RARE_ by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of _RARE_ . STO
* In the tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and _RARE_ to speak and to listen . STO
* Three days had passed since Spencer's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears . STO
* Gansevoort said , `` It requires an _RARE_ eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely . STO
* To have the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed . STO
* From actions aboard , it is easy to guess that Spencer's _RARE_ of twenty _RARE_ followers was a modest estimate '' . STO
* `` Well '' , Heiser _RARE_ , `` why don't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' -- `` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke in . STO
* `` There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners . STO
* Besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? STO
* Then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the United States , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order . STO
* Mr. Heiser , does this sound like a truly _RARE_ plan to you ? STO
* Do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now '' ? STO
* _RARE_ said , `` Of course they would . STO
* They are about to do so at any moment as it is . STO
* All that is needed is for one man to feel _RARE_ enough to take the lead . STO
* As soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer , we are going to be rushed . STO
* We are going to be rushed and murdered '' . STO
* `` That is _RARE_ language , Mr. _RARE_ . STO
* We are not going to be rushed and murdered '' , Alexander said . STO
* `` We are going to bring the Somers into New York harbor safe and sound '' . STO
* `` Of course , I agree with the Captain '' , Gansevoort said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy is _RARE_ and desperate . STO
* The _RARE_ of discipline has been lost . STO
* Anything is possible when _RARE_ has the upper hand '' . STO
* He paused , then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon . STO
* _RARE_ of wood and iron are available for close and _RARE_ combat no matter where a man stands . STO
* And we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' . STO
* `` We ourselves must stand _RARE_ '' . STO
* Alexander said . STO
* `` Under arms day and night , watch and watch about . STO
* Those of us present , the _RARE_ brothers , _RARE_ and the other _RARE_ now have the responsibility of the Somers . STO
* A great deal of labor we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed '' . STO
* And when he was alone again in the cabin , Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done . STO
* With all his heart he had loved the Navy and now he must act in accordance with the Navy's _RARE_ laws . STO
* And when he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the Navy to which he had dedicated his soul . STO
* Where had he failed ? STO
* How had he failed ? STO
* He who had tried so hard , who had _RARE_ so _RARE_ to be a great officer . STO
* It came to him as he wept there aboard the Somers that it was as foolish to _RARE_ for _RARE_ as to seek to storm the _RARE_ of heaven . STO
* It was given or it was not given . STO
* One did one's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward . STO
* One did one's best and if fortune frowned , an _RARE_ boy with murder in his heart _RARE_ aboard one's ship . STO
* And Alexander _RARE_ like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame . STO
* God knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an _RARE_ rage for _RARE_ that he had held precious his naval career . STO
* Another field had given him _RARE_ enough to satisfy any _RARE_ . STO
* It was for love that he had served the Navy . STO
* To have someday that love returned was what he had lived for . STO
* Now the hope was gone . STO
* Yes , he would bring the Somers safely into New York harbor but at a price . STO
* _RARE_ God , at what a price . STO
* And after a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity . STO
* _RARE_ , he _RARE_ the prisoners , _RARE_ himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason . STO
* The prisoners _RARE_ their eyes but not before he had _RARE_ hatred and anger . STO
* Only Cromwell , the giant _RARE_ , was _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* He said , `` Captain , may I speak , please ? STO
* Captain , I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' . STO
* `` Are you , Cromwell '' ? STO
* `` Yes , sir . STO
* Before God I swear I am innocent . STO
* I know nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing '' . STO
* `` You are the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' . STO
* `` I cannot speak for others , sir , but I am innocent '' . STO
* He leaned closer to Alexander , _RARE_ up at him from the deck . STO
* `` Surely , Captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' . STO
* `` No , Cromwell , I did not find your name . STO
* You were careful about that '' . STO
* Now Spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from _RARE_ , spoke . STO
* He said , `` Cromwell is telling you the truth . STO
* He is innocent '' . STO
* Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer . STO
* The _RARE_ and _RARE_ of his tone suggested _RARE_ of how _RARE_ was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell . STO
* Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him naive or _RARE_ . STO
* And in a sudden wave of painful clarity , Alexander recognized a _RARE_ with Spencer . STO
* Here was another human who understood the _RARE_ of _RARE_ with the inevitable . STO
* There was good fortune and there was bad and Philip Spencer , in _RARE_ and ankle _RARE_ , knew it to be a truth . STO
* He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ captain , towering above the _RARE_ as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon Philip Spencer . STO
* This tragic _RARE_ had _RARE_ his own _RARE_ . STO
* But he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him . STO
* And because fortune had favored neither the _RARE_ nor the _RARE_ captain , they would be each other's _RARE_ . STO
* `` Spencer , if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent ? STO
* He was your constant companion '' . STO
* The _RARE_ eyes met _RARE_ . STO
* `` I tell you he is innocent '' . STO
* `` And do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word '' ? STO
* `` Yes . STO
* I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell '' . STO
* `` Nothing to lose , either , Spencer '' . STO
* `` That's true '' , Spencer agreed and _RARE_ himself from the conversation . STO
* His eyes went back to _RARE_ of the sea . STO
* `` I am innocent , Captain '' , Cromwell said again . STO
* `` Before God , Captain , I am innocent '' . STO
* And though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an _RARE_ , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell . STO
* The _RARE_ was as guilty as any . STO
* No action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four _RARE_ , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in _RARE_ hands while Spencer whispered explanations . STO
* `` I thought '' , _RARE_ _RARE_ had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' . STO
* It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in _RARE_ to the _RARE_ , where a class of _RARE_ _RARE_ him . STO
* This was a training ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of _RARE_ _RARE_ here which Alexander recognized . STO
* Some of these _RARE_ were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer's followers . STO
* Rachel _RARE_ me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ lay in the _RARE_ . STO
* The air smelled _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* A young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick _RARE_ . STO
* He wore a long _RARE_ coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with _RARE_ . STO
* His black hat with its wide _RARE_ , high crown , and _RARE_ _RARE_ rode high . STO
* With his head erect , he approached , not glancing at us , and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead . STO
* He had a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled _RARE_ . STO
* I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms . STO
* The girls in the market place wore _RARE_ dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings . STO
* I turned and watched him stride down the center of the road . STO
* His hands were swinging at his sides , and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and , _RARE_ on his _RARE_ , he entered an old stone building . STO
* Rachel had seen me watching the young man . STO
* She smiled . STO
* `` When your mother was here he must have been a young boy . STO
* Like the ones you will see now '' . STO
* I swallowed hard and looked down at my feet _RARE_ along beside Rachel . STO
* She led me into a twisting side alley . STO
* The dirty , _RARE_ buildings looked _RARE_ up , and their few windows stood high above our heads . STO
* Rachel said that schools and _RARE_ occupied most of the buildings . STO
* We entered one where the front door stood _RARE_ and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor . STO
* An old man with a white beard and dressed in a long _RARE_ coat , _RARE_ trousers , and a black _RARE_ greeted us . STO
* Rachel talked to him . STO
* He nodded , _RARE_ and _RARE_ his hands over his _RARE_ , and flicked _RARE_ at me . STO
* I thought he would ask us to leave because Rachel and I were _RARE_ , but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor . STO
* His toes pointed out toward the walls . STO
* He stopped in front of a door , placed a finger on his lips , and , still peering down into his beard , pushed open the door to a classroom . STO
* We stepped inside . STO
* He left us . STO
* Little boys crowded together on long wooden _RARE_ , and in the center of the room sat the teacher . STO
* His black beard dripped down over the front of his coat . STO
* One white hand poised a stick above his desk . STO
* He turned his _RARE_ , _RARE_ eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in _RARE_ , `` One , two , three '' ! STO
* _RARE_ the stick against the desk . STO
* The little boys _RARE_ out a _RARE_ translation or interpretation of the Five _RARE_ of _RARE_ , which they had previously _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* They _RARE_ a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick . STO
* Each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his _RARE_ and _RARE_ had studied and prayed in the _RARE_ of Europe . STO
* The boys were tiny . STO
* They had large bright eyes , the small _RARE_ _RARE_ of all babies everywhere , and hair _RARE_ short except for the long _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ their little white faces . STO
* They bent over _RARE_ _RARE_ and looked up only to watch the teacher . STO
* Since they did not glance curiously at us once , I guessed that there was a penalty for _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ language from the ghetto stopped . STO
* The teacher plunged the children into a new portion , this time in _RARE_ , _RARE_ the stick _RARE_ . STO
* One boy who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and _RARE_ . STO
* His tightly curled _RARE_ hung down to his narrow shoulders . STO
* In the center of his brilliant _RARE_ sat a small black _RARE_ . STO
* His head barely rose above the table . STO
* I stared at him for a long time . STO
* He did not return my interest . STO
* My eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys . STO
* Some of them ignored the _RARE_ and had apparently _RARE_ the words long ago . STO
* They _RARE_ the portion at the teacher , who accompanied them in an _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ them on with the stick . STO
* The _RARE_ defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake . STO
* I could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair . STO
* His body _RARE_ back and forth on the bench . STO
* His front teeth were missing . STO
* I shuddered and backed out of the room . STO
* Rachel followed , looked at me , and _RARE_ with her tongue . STO
* We walked down the cool hall silently . STO
* From behind us came the _RARE_ of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to _RARE_ their lives to rigid study and prayer . STO
* I said , `` How long do they keep that up '' ? STO
* `` All day '' , she said . STO
* `` _RARE_ for _RARE_ , when they are _RARE_ all day '' . STO
* I rubbed my hands together . STO
* They had turned _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the classroom . STO
* The old man in the _RARE_ clothes waited at the foot of the steps . STO
* He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in _RARE_ . STO
* Rachel said , `` He asks for money '' . STO
* She passed by him . STO
* I reached into the pocket of my skirt , _RARE_ ten _RARE_ , and dropped the coin . STO
* Then I picked it up again and handed it to the old man . STO
* He _RARE_ me . STO
* I didn't look at him . STO
* I grinned at Rachel . STO
* `` Does this bother you '' ? STO
* I said . STO
* She smiled to herself . STO
* `` Most of our _RARE_ think it's horrible . STO
* When we were fighting , a few of our _RARE_ people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass . STO
* They said that we must not fight but wait for the _RARE_ '' . STO
* I was amazed . STO
* You had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home . STO
* You had to be stupid or crazy or _RARE_ . STO
* And I wasn't . STO
* I was American . STO
* You had to know , also , that you were going to fail . STO
* All of it might have been heroic , but they had done it in the wrong place . STO
* I _RARE_ them . STO
* Rachel faced me . STO
* Her bright eyes were _RARE_ . STO
* She said , `` Sometimes I think they are keeping religion for us while we play around . STO
* Your mother hated this way of life . STO
* She wished to change much for the children here '' . STO
* I said quietly , _RARE_ , `` What did she do here ? STO
* In this section '' ? STO
* Rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth . STO
* `` Here , nothing . STO
* But when she saw the children you have just visited , she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country , in the _RARE_ . STO
* She loved the children . STO
* She was a strange woman , your mother . STO
* When she loved , it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved . STO
* Nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted . STO
* She stayed here to work for _RARE_ . STO
* For many _RARE_ , for many children , the first thing they knew of _RARE_ and freedom was your mother . STO
* Sometimes it was dangerous for her '' . STO
* Rachel grinned _RARE_ . STO
* `` But she loved danger . STO
* She took it with her wherever she went ; ; she chose it . STO
* And I think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people . STO
* She was most strange woman . STO
* _RARE_ to follow her impulse . STO
* It was an impulse when she was here in _RARE_ _RARE_ -- I was with her -- that led her to stay in _RARE_ . STO
* Your mother wanted to bring children to _RARE_ so that they could leave their _RARE_ . STO
* Here they did not need to be in _RARE_ . STO
* If she could not take the children out of this section , at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms . STO
* She set out to make sure that no Jewish child _RARE_ in the world had to live in a place such as this '' . STO
* I said quietly , gaining nerve , ready to ask any question at all , no matter how intimate , ready to be _RARE_ , `` Then why did she leave _RARE_ ? STO
* I'd like to know that very much '' . STO
* Rachel _RARE_ her hands together and slowed her pace . STO
* The soles of her _RARE_ reported sharply on the _RARE_ . STO
* She _RARE_ her lips , then clamped them together so tightly that I thought she was angry with me . STO
* But she sighed and her face relaxed . STO
* `` _RARE_ came into her life . STO
* She had good friends here , people who liked her . STO
* Who loved her . STO
* But she had to go out and hurt herself . STO
* There was a man here in town . STO
* He helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted . STO
* She worked very hard . STO
* There was a refugee who was able to come here because of her . STO
* He came with his son . STO
* At first I thought they were relatives of your mother , but it was not so . STO
* This refugee was a middle-aged man , a big , handsome man with a _RARE_ to his walk as I have never before seen . STO
* He had the black _RARE_ on his arm , so he had been _RARE_ in a concentration camp . STO
* Yet he walked like a young man . STO
* Often he was terribly _RARE_ and talked to no one . STO
* Then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of Europe . STO
* All his family was dead , except for his son . STO
* Your mother would always _RARE_ him when he wandered off , and she would send him home to his son . STO
* He loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him . STO
* Then his son did something '' -- Rachel threw up her hands -- `` I don't know what , but something , to an official here -- it was during the _RARE_ -- and the son was _RARE_ . STO
* A few hours after the son was _RARE_ , your mother was informed . STO
* She ran from a little group of us . STO
* We were sitting together , talking . STO
* She went to the father and found he had _RARE_ himself '' . STO
* Rachel paused . STO
* It was silent in the stone alley . STO
* Then she continued with energy , `` I myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father . STO
* No one saw her except the man Reuveni '' . STO
* `` Yes '' , I said . STO
* `` I know him '' . STO
* Rachel gave me a direct , _RARE_ look . STO
* She said , `` Reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee . STO
* He said she would only hurt herself . STO
* He complained to me once that I must talk to her . STO
* When I did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that Reuveni wanted her to marry him . STO
* I asked her if she would , and she said she would not . STO
* He had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not _RARE_ to marry him . STO
* Anyway , I did not see her until two weeks after the refugee _RARE_ himself . STO
* She came to me one day . STO
* She was pale and skinny ; ; she was terribly alone . STO
* And she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to Reuveni and accepted his proposal . STO
* He shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself . STO
* But now he was happy she would let him _RARE_ out her life and take care of her . STO
* He would never let her harm herself again . STO
* For one whole week he never let her stay alone . STO
* She let him lead her around . STO
* He took her to a doctor , for she was run down , nervous , did not care where she was . STO
* Reuveni took her with him wherever he went . STO
* He did not let her talk to people ; ; he did not let her choose her own food . STO
* She was limp and beaten from her loss ; ; she did not care . STO
* `` And I'll take you with me '' . STO
* The two of them against the world . STO
* That had been how she imagined it . STO
* For when he began to talk and dream all at the same time , making his plans as he went , she had begun dreaming too . STO
* But now the dream was over . STO
* The big waking up had happened . STO
* `` What did I imagine '' ? STO
* She thought . STO
* `` Did I see him about to swing low in a _RARE_ ? STO
* Or maybe _RARE_ up the south fork of the _RARE_ _RARE_ River _RARE_ the wastes dumped in it ? STO
* Maybe I saw him on a _RARE_ with a gang of _RARE_ _RARE_ it '' . STO
* And I'll take you with me . STO
* He had taken her all right . STO
* Wednesday nights after youth _RARE_ . STO
* Out of the church and into his big car , it _RARE_ over the road with him driving and the headlights _RARE_ the _RARE_ ahead and after he hit college , his _RARE_ , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , _RARE_ really , with a _RARE_ naked light bulb in the ceiling ( _RARE_ and naked as a _RARE_ , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the _RARE_ _RARE_ in after the _RARE_ , watching in between your _RARE_ at _RARE_ ) , a room complete with _RARE_ _RARE_ the light and the few casual _RARE_ _RARE_ the walls , an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ waving . STO
* And the bed that _RARE_ in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for _RARE_ talk in the next room when Gratt went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened . STO
* And Gratt Shafer would be in _RARE_ today for the wedding _RARE_ and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along . STO
* Like _RARE_ and the _RARE_ up there _RARE_ the _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ back in his office _RARE_ out teeth , like they all knew he would . STO
* Just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a _RARE_ or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen . STO
* Or you could hope the _RARE_ wouldn't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to _RARE_ _RARE_ in his suit of red _RARE_ , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid -- a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the _RARE_ feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` I think I'm pregnant '' . STO
* You could wish that . STO
* Or you could wish your _RARE_ would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve _RARE_ out of him like air out of a _RARE_ tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is _RARE_ and at night . STO
* So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new _RARE_ _RARE_ , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned _RARE_ tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , _RARE_ to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help . STO
* And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has _RARE_ you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , _RARE_ her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too . STO
* It is not having his baby _RARE_ warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some _RARE_ cracks your _RARE_ . STO
* And most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he _RARE_ a bread truck or _RARE_ the mail or checks the _RARE_ _RARE_ down at the _RARE_ , or _RARE_ seventeen oil _RARE_ and six _RARE_ mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one . STO
* He can even be a _RARE_ _RARE_ guy with _RARE_ ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even _RARE_ couldn't figure out , how it is unlocked . STO
* And he can be on the way to _RARE_ , your Gratt Shafer can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him -- really want him -- dead . STO
* Because if you can't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him . STO
* For you don't share him , not even with God . STO
* If it is love , you don't . STO
* And I'll take you with me . STO
* Even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie . STO
* Even when he is on the way to _RARE_ you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you . STO
* And in a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart . STO
* You feel him every mile further away . STO
* You feel where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't . STO
* And you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the _RARE_ who begged you to marry him , the one with the _RARE_ hair and the car he couldn't afford and the _RARE_ shoes . STO
* You think : `` Did he feel that way about me '' ? STO
* It comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have Gratt Shafer ; ; that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy . STO
* It _RARE_ on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because Gratt Shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to Gratt _RARE_ substitute , that other guy . STO
* And you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success . STO
* You wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you . STO
* You wonder about the Christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you . STO
* `` Damn the world '' , she thought . STO
* She looked out at the corn field , the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the _RARE_ fence _RARE_ the grounds . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ factories there . STO
* _RARE_ and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the balloon and the _RARE_ and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments . STO
* The bands were impatient , but they were the only ones . STO
* The others , the ones in the stands , were _RARE_ , for hearing the _RARE_ was for them like listening to a _RARE_ was for sophisticated folks in New York City . STO
* It was like being in the _RARE_ hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day . STO
* So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , feeling . STO
* If a man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever . STO
* You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too . STO
* It was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it . STO
* You laughed and then your chest _RARE_ and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ along your arm . STO
* He hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought . STO
* While he talked you wouldn't trade being a West Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no matter if it hadn't , in six weeks , _RARE_ enough to wet a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* She glanced at the man _RARE_ beside her , a man with weather cracks _RARE_ into his lean cheeks , with _RARE_ pale eyes reflecting all the _RARE_ he had seen , reflecting the sky and the _RARE_ which must follow now in August -- yes , with eyes _RARE_ the _RARE_ and here it was only June , only _RARE_ time again and thoughts of Gratt Shafer would not leave her . STO
* `` I should have stayed at the store '' , she thought . STO
* Back at the _RARE_ with the other old _RARE_ , back there she was the _RARE_ clerk and she was _RARE_ , which made her young enough to _RARE_ the usual ideal working conditions , like the _RARE_ toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down . STO
* There was no lock because _RARE_ didn't allow a lock . STO
* A lock on the toilet would encourage _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The toilet hadn't had a sincere _RARE_ in years and there were things written on the walls of the little _RARE_ place because you couldn't keep the public out -- entirely . STO
* She could not count the times _RARE_ had _RARE_ on the door , just a couple of _RARE_ that shook the whole damned closet and might , someday , break away the pipe connections from the wall . STO
* The two little _RARE_ meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would _RARE_ open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , _RARE_ clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot . STO
* And the hours were _RARE_ in the morning until eleven at night on _RARE_ and during sales , and there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* Among us , we three handled quite a few small _RARE_ , from spot drawings for advertising agencies _RARE_ to magazine work and quick _RARE_ jobs . STO
* Each of us had his own _RARE_ besides . STO
* George did wonderful complicated _RARE_ drawings like something out of a medieval _RARE_ : hundreds of delicate details _RARE_ into an _RARE_ sheet and looking as if they had been done under a _RARE_ glass . STO
* He also drew precise crisp spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic _RARE_ , The New _RARE_ , for instance , or _RARE_ . STO
* I did book _RARE_ and covers for _RARE_ _RARE_ : naked girls _RARE_ in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , _RARE_ the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver . STO
* The book could be The _RARE_ _RARE_ , but it would still have the same jacket illustration . STO
* I remember once I did a jacket for _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , clothes . STO
* I even _RARE_ out the materials from which _RARE_ were made -- _RARE_ wood covered with leather -- so I'd get the light _RARE_ accurate . STO
* _RARE_ , the art editor , took one look at my finished _RARE_ and said , `` Nothing doing , _RARE_ . STO
* In the first place , it's static ; ; in the second place , it doesn't look authentic ; ; and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to _RARE_ in the first place -- you've got six colors there including gold '' . STO
* I said , `` Mr. _RARE_ , it is as authentic as careful research can make it '' . STO
* He said , `` That may be , but it isn't authentic the way readers think . STO
* They know from their _RARE_ into television and the movies that _RARE_ in the middle ages had beautiful flowing _RARE_ like Little Lord _RARE_ , and only the _RARE_ had _RARE_ . STO
* And girls couldn't have dressed like that -- it isn't _RARE_ enough '' . STO
* In the end , I did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy , gave him a _RARE_ instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the _RARE_ of a costume movie . STO
* _RARE_ was as happy as a _RARE_ . STO
* `` That's _RARE_ '' , he said . STO
* As for Donald , he actually sold paintings . STO
* We all painted in our spare time , and we had all started as _RARE_ painters with _RARE_ , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it . STO
* Not much ; ; he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to Joyce _RARE_ or her friends . STO
* He had style , a real inner vision of his very own . STO
* It was strange stuff -- it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults . STO
* There was the _RARE_ of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of _RARE_ , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and _RARE_ you in the eye . STO
* We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so _RARE_ . STO
* It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting . STO
* He also had , at times , an _RARE_ _RARE_ air like a _RARE_ ; ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For Christ's sake , Donald , you've got _RARE_ blue all over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well . STO
* Mrs. _RARE_ thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting . STO
* It was all _RARE_ , and Donald didn't need much to live on ; ; none of us did . STO
* We shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap _RARE_ of one kind or another . STO
* _RARE_ the life class was my idea -- or rather , _RARE_ idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two wouldn't have gone if I hadn't talked them into it . STO
* I wanted to paint again . STO
* I hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year . STO
* It wasn't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself . STO
* It was the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting . STO
* I kept saying , `` If I could just build up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get to be well known as an _RARE_ -- like Peter Askington , for instance -- then I could take some time off and paint '' . STO
* Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; ; I had admired him long before I talked to him . STO
* It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income . STO
* The night we first met , at one of Mrs. _RARE_ giant parties , he was wearing a brown _RARE_ jacket with silver _RARE_ and a soft pink _RARE_ shirt ; ; instead of a _RARE_ he wore a leather _RARE_ drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure _RARE_ . STO
* This set his tone : _RARE_ of texture and color , and another kind of _RARE_ as well , for his clothing and _RARE_ would have paid the _RARE_ rent for a year . STO
* He was fifteen years older than I -- _RARE_ -- but full of spring and _RARE_ . STO
* He didn't look like what I thought of as an old man , and his _RARE_ and _RARE_ speech made him seem even younger . STO
* He was one of the most prominent magazine _RARE_ in America ; ; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month . STO
* Life had included him in its `` _RARE_ American Artists '' series and had _RARE_ him at his studio in the East Sixties ; ; the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have _RARE_ in it painting the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* I had a long talk with him . STO
* We went into Mrs. _RARE_ library , which had low _RARE_ all along the walls , and above them a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a Jackson Pollock twelve feet long , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ with a yellow background , that looked like an _RARE_ from a Martian _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ had _RARE_ made for Mrs. _RARE_ by Picasso himself . STO
* Like certain expensive _RARE_ , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being _RARE_ yourself . STO
* In the course of our talk , Askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying . STO
* `` By yourself '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` No , I take classes with different people '' , he said . STO
* `` I don't think I've reached the point , yet , where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft . STO
* Besides , it's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other _RARE_ , as _RARE_ went to Italy to meet _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' . STO
* He made a circle with his thumb and fingers . STO
* `` _RARE_ isn't this big , you know . STO
* It doesn't embrace only the artist , alone before his _RARE_ . STO
* It is as large as all of art , _RARE_ , varied , _RARE_ '' . STO
* He threw his arms wide , his face shining . STO
* `` The artist is like a _RARE_ of a _RARE_ -- no , he is more than that , a _RARE_ _RARE_ in some vast _RARE_ . STO
* One of these days , I'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days , from extreme abstract _RARE_ to extreme _RARE_ , and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other . STO
* The eye is all , inward or _RARE_ . STO
* Ah , what a title for the exhibition : The _RARE_ is All '' ! STO
* `` What do you study '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* I was _RARE_ ; ; just listening to him made me feel intelligent . STO
* `` I'm studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied . STO
* `` Maybe you know him . STO
* He _RARE_ at the Manhattan School of Art '' . STO
* I nodded . STO
* I had studied with Burns ten years before , during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me , along with the _RARE_ _RARE_ for my paintings of _RARE_ on Hudson Street . STO
* Burns and I had not loved each other . STO
* `` I'm also studying _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , he went on , `` and twice a week I go to a life class taught by _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ? STO
* I said . STO
* `` My God , is he still alive ? STO
* He must be a million years old . STO
* I went to a _RARE_ of his work when I was eighteen , and I thought he was a contemporary of _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Not quite '' . STO
* Askington laughed . STO
* `` He's about sixty , now . STO
* Still painting , still a kind of modern _RARE_ , beautiful _RARE_ of mountains and farms . STO
* He even makes the city look like one of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I've always admired him , and when I heard he was taking a few pupils , I went to him and joined his class '' . STO
* `` Yes , it sounds great '' , I said , `` but suppose you don't think of yourself as an _RARE_ painter '' ? STO
* `` You're missing the point '' , he said . STO
* `` He has the _RARE_ eye . STO
* And he is a great man . STO
* _RARE_ with him is _RARE_ . STO
* And that's the trouble with so many artists today . STO
* They lack stimulation . STO
* They sit alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in _RARE_ themselves still farther from life . STO
* That's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation . STO
* In the _RARE_ Ages , in the Renaissance , right up to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world . STO
* He was an _RARE_ , a man who studied his trade and developed his _RARE_ the way a _RARE_ or a wood _RARE_ did . STO
* He filled a real need , showing society what it looked like , turning it inside out , _RARE_ its wars and its leaders , its _RARE_ and its _RARE_ , reflecting its profound religious _RARE_ . STO
* He was a _RARE_ -- they weren't afraid of the word , then -- _RARE_ , nature lover , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , what you will , a member of every party and of no party . STO
* But look at us today ! STO
* We hold safe little jobs _RARE_ _RARE_ ads or the _RARE_ _RARE_ in trivial novels , and most of our _RARE_ painting is nothing but picking the _RARE_ out of the _RARE_ so it can be _RARE_ in greater _RARE_ . STO
* A bunch of _RARE_ _RARE_ ! STO
* What we need is to get back to the group , to learning and _RARE_ , to the cafe and the school '' . STO
* He could certainly talk . STO
* The _RARE_ of the evening was that I got the address of _RARE_ studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . STO
* It was an awkward hour , but I didn't have to _RARE_ any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job . STO
* After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the _RARE_ reading out to work . STO
* It was mostly for the benefit of the _RARE_ , because hardly anybody else ever visited us . STO
* In a way , Askington was right . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' was the word for it . STO
* I don't know that it was always as _RARE_ as I had expected it to be . STO
* _RARE_ , it was because _RARE_ himself wasn't what I anticipated . STO
* I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic , and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead _RARE_ . STO
* No , that isn't quite fair . STO
* Actually , there was a lot of force in him , which is why I kept on in that class instead of _RARE_ after a week . STO
* Such a little thing to start with -- the car registration . STO
* `` _RARE_ , where is the car license '' ? STO
* She asked . STO
* `` I can't find it in the _RARE_ compartment '' . STO
* `` Via must have it '' , I answered readily enough , _RARE_ her last visit . STO
* `` Via '' , she was frowning . STO
* `` Why should Via have it '' ? STO
* Had she forgotten she had signed the car away , that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children ? STO
* I was silent . STO
* I didn't want to _RARE_ things up . STO
* `` I drive my own car by _RARE_ of Via '' ? STO
* `` I'm sure she'd turn it over to you , if you'd rather . STO
* You know that '' . STO
* She looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud . STO
* `` She must have taken the registration when she went to _RARE_ . STO
* I'll call her '' . STO
* `` No , thank you . STO
* I want nothing of _RARE_ '' . STO
* Why should this suddenly _RARE_ her ? STO
* Walter was giving me checks for my pay , the household bills . STO
* Had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind ? STO
* `` What a fool I've been '' , she said quietly . STO
* `` I knew all this , but I paid no attention . STO
* I don't even own the house I'm standing in . STO
* I was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace , and then the lawyer would tear up all those things `` It _RARE_ down down down and finally there is no way out . STO
* If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' . STO
* I suppose I should have paid attention to that _RARE_ remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress _RARE_ in . STO
* I love you , I hate you , I feel like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living . STO
* So I went about my business . STO
* I made a lemon _RARE_ , a light dessert , _RARE_ a chicken , _RARE_ some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the _RARE_ for the weekend . STO
* `` Don't bother , _RARE_ '' , she said . STO
* `` I have these _RARE_ in town for Saturday , and I'll probably spend Sunday with _RARE_ or the _RARE_ '' . STO
* At last , I thought , she's _RARE_ her spirits . STO
* With this _RARE_ in London , and new faces about her there , she would soon be a more _RARE_ , a wiser person , all the better for her stay out here . STO
* I felt more cheerful , as if I had had a part in bringing her through to a greater _RARE_ of herself . STO
* And I went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life . STO
* It was _RARE_ that evening , but the path to my house was so well _RARE_ that I could feel my way , accustomed as I was to the dense _RARE_ that rise from the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the river and sometimes last for days . STO
* In the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village I crept along with my headlights full on . STO
* I did notice a _RARE_ of light from the big house through the woods but as I had left a light on in my own house because of the fog I assumed Mrs. Salter had done the same before she left for town . STO
* I did my shopping , had my dentist appointment , and from there I went to the women's lunch at our _RARE_ church where we discussed plans for the annual Christmas _RARE_ , so that dusk was beginning to gather when I drove home in the late afternoon . STO
* But the next day -- Sunday . STO
* Why , when I drove down to church , didn't it speak to me , seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear ? STO
* _RARE_ brought to the _RARE_ accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember , and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove , absent itself , _RARE_ . STO
* When I came back from church at noon Mrs. _RARE_ was turning into the Salter driveway . STO
* Even at a car's length I could sense that something was wrong , and so I followed her up to the _RARE_ in front of the house . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us . STO
* `` She's nowhere , nowhere '' ! STO
* She screamed , and both women ran up to the house , and I followed . STO
* The search began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening _RARE_ , talking , _RARE_ in _RARE_ and gasps . STO
* Everything was as I had left it the night before last -- her _RARE_ and bag for town , her _RARE_ and dress and shoes laid out only her _RARE_ coat was missing . STO
* And she . STO
* Then the _RARE_ began . STO
* I , who until that day before had been Mrs. _RARE_ friend , her equal , was the _RARE_ now . STO
* It was _RARE_ and Mrs. _RARE_ who were calling Via , everybody . STO
* And when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me . STO
* And after I brought them _RARE_ and coffee I had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait . STO
* _RARE_ in the kitchen I recalled every word Mrs. Salter said that could have been a sign to me . STO
* `` If I am not to be Mrs. Salter then I am nothing '' . STO
* Why didn't that alarm me then ? STO
* And when she returned from taking her guests back to New York she had said , `` All they talked about was _RARE_ _RARE_ this , _RARE_ that When they know the truth will they drop away from me , will I become a nothing '' ? STO
* And then I remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to Rome I had heard her _RARE_ , over and over again , `` On the boat people liked me for myself '' . STO
* I had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage , just to check . STO
* The last night I had called , but the line was always busy and it reassured me . STO
* I assumed it was one of those _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ or _RARE_ , she comfortable in bed . STO
* But it seemed not from what they were saying . STO
* Then was it a final desperate _RARE_ from her , to whom ? STO
* _RARE_ on and on past any man's patience some final _RARE_ of conclusion ? STO
* She was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff . STO
* I tried to believe that what must have happened was that , restless , disturbed by this telephone call or whatever , she walked out in the night , as she had a habit of doing . STO
* Sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff . STO
* It's so romantic up there , she used to say , with the broad river gleaming in its _RARE_ like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night , so poetic . STO
* With all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a _RARE_ rock , a _RARE_ . STO
* But I didn't really think it was as simple as that , nor did anyone else . STO
* When a _RARE_ brought her up in his arms , still , small , as if she were a child asleep , I began to _RARE_ with a terrible excitement , almost _RARE_ , that I still cannot account for . STO
* Was it a hysterical release from the long strain of _RARE_ of those weeks ? STO
* That at last the _RARE_ , the will gives way ? STO
* Or what was it that , before Via , _RARE_ , Walter and all , I began almost to dance with _RARE_ and cry out , `` I knew she'd do it ! STO
* I knew '' ! STO
* Everyone stared at me and drew back . STO
* Their eyes turned cold and accusing , even _RARE_ . STO
* And they have never changed . STO
* At the same time that I thought I understood her at long last and _RARE_ her , _RARE_ this knowing had there burned _RARE_ by my pity a fire of hate , an _RARE_ _RARE_ that burst out in that _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* Was that what had given way in me ? STO
* Even now I am _RARE_ at how little anyone knows of what they really are . STO
* It is absurd of course to say that that one _RARE_ _RARE_ me from the family I considered my very own , but there it _RARE_ , a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other . STO
* At the time I was filled with _RARE_ at this separation , but in the years since I have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that _RARE_ . STO
* In my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her , so if they told themselves that I could have prevented it , I can understand that by now and love them still , because everyone must justify , have a _RARE_ for what is not to be borne . STO
* It is not their _RARE_ that _RARE_ ; ; it is when I meet someone who was a close friend of the family , and therefore of mine , and they nod to me so _RARE_ and walk away , that it _RARE_ . STO
* I could tell them , but no one ever asked , why I had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body . STO
* No , I forget Mrs. _RARE_ , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened . STO
* She haunted me ; ; she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country . STO
* `` We all feel guilty '' , I turned away from her coldly . STO
* `` It was _RARE_ fault . STO
* She _RARE_ her hand '' . STO
* `` What do you mean '' ? STO
* She frowned . STO
* `` Why put such a high value on being top dog '' ? STO
* I added . STO
* It was _RARE_ , almost _RARE_ , this _RARE_ _RARE_ , and she has never come to see me since . STO
* But suppose she had not taken Mrs. _RARE_ advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns , _RARE_ of love , hanging on to _RARE_ , and altogether and finally _RARE_ . STO
* If she chose , and in that final decision _RARE_ , what , above all , all of us value , life itself , must she not have _RARE_ to her _RARE_ height , and _RARE_ her _RARE_ self , felt at last the passion of a great moral decision ? STO
* If they say I could have stopped her it is because they are _RARE_ of her last weeks of _RARE_ , her search into herself and its conclusions . STO
* Yes , I had cried out that I knew she'd do it , but without my fully _RARE_ it at the time , it was a cry of triumph for her , _RARE_ at her _RARE_ from _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- and guilt . STO
* She was finally at rest in truth , of her own proud free choice . STO
* At rest with my darling _RARE_ , the first Mrs. Salter . STO
* Mr. Salter came home . STO
* The funeral service was in the house , the Methodist minister , how clean and glistening his _RARE_ and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that _RARE_ inside , a stranger speaking to _RARE_ the old sacred words , and the rain _RARE_ _RARE_ in accompaniment , seven days of _RARE_ rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed . STO
* I waited . STO
* Then Via called to say they had decided to _RARE_ her -- as they had _RARE_ , the thought leaped to my mind -- and did I want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning . STO
* The coffin stood on _RARE_ in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor , on its dark shining surface the _RARE_ of white _RARE_ I had ordered . STO
* I knelt , just for decency I thought at the time , but found myself _RARE_ , `` Our Father which Art in Heaven '' And it was only after that that something unlocked in me and I felt a grief . STO
* Via was in the parking lot when I went outside . STO
* _RARE_ we waited in her car until the _RARE_ moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of New Jersey . STO
* By the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the _RARE_ _RARE_ with its _RARE_ symbols of religious _RARE_ . STO
* Again I felt _RARE_ to _RARE_ , and reached back and pulled Via down . STO
* Something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of _RARE_ would give her some _RARE_ . STO
* `` I had a rather small place of my own . STO
* A nice _RARE_ apartment in a place called the _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left _RARE_ . STO
* `` And then I had another place farther downtown I used as a studio '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I'm not a man who has many close intimate friends , Carla '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him . STO
* `` Oh , I'd drink with newspaper people . STO
* I think I was what you might call a _RARE_ man , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio , doing my work , that I really felt alive . STO
* But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' . STO
* _RARE_ , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question . STO
* She showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little . STO
* `` Well , what about you , Carla '' ? STO
* `` Me '' ? STO
* She asked , turning slowly . STO
* `` What about me '' ? STO
* `` Did you make friends easily '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Somehow I imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot . STO
* How about it '' ? STO
* `` I guess so '' , she said taking a _RARE_ from her purse . STO
* When she had wiped some of the _RARE_ from her mouth , she stared _RARE_ at her image in the mirror . STO
* `` Are your people still alive '' ? STO
* He asked , trying to touch a part of her life _RARE_ hadn't discussed ; ; so he could have something of her for himself . STO
* `` You talk so well , Carla '' , he went on . STO
* `` You seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he added , trying to _RARE_ her _RARE_ . STO
* `` You must have been good at history at school . STO
* Where did you go to school '' ? STO
* `` What is this '' ? STO
* She asked , turning suddenly . STO
* `` Don't you know all about me by this time ? STO
* My _RARE_ Carla _RARE_ . STO
* This is my town . STO
* I sleep with you . STO
* You know something more about me every day , don't you ? STO
* Would you be _RARE_ if I made up some stories about my life , told you some lies ? STO
* Why are you trying to worry me '' ? STO
* `` I'm not trying to worry you '' . STO
* `` Well , all right then '' . STO
* The _RARE_ tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing . STO
* At home he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance . STO
* Was she just naturally _RARE_ about everything but her physical appearance ? STO
* He wondered . STO
* Would he have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her stockings , make the bed while she lay around ? STO
* He straightened up , ready to vent his _RARE_ , then grew afraid . STO
* If he _RARE_ on the _RARE_ he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too . STO
* `` What's the matter '' ? STO
* She asked suddenly . STO
* `` Nothing . STO
* Nothing at all '' , he said quietly . STO
* `` Let's go out '' . STO
* `` Are those the only shoes you have , Sam '' ? STO
* `` What's the matter with them '' ? STO
* `` The heavy thick soles . STO
* Look at them '' . STO
* `` They're an expensive English shoe for walking around a lot . STO
* I like them '' . STO
* `` Sam , no one around here _RARE_ such heavy soles . STO
* Can't you get another pair '' ? STO
* `` Maybe I could '' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him . STO
* `` I'll get an _RARE_ pair of _RARE_ Italian shoes tomorrow , Carla '' . STO
* `` And I don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face . STO
* `` What's the matter with it '' ? STO
* He had put on the gray jacket and the _RARE_ slacks and the _RARE_ shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had encountered her on the street . STO
* `` Oh , Sam . STO
* You look like a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Can't you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged '' ? STO
* `` I don't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention . STO
* _RARE_ his clothes , he put on his _RARE_ _RARE_ suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good . STO
* But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself . STO
* She no longer wanted anything about him to _RARE_ her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in _RARE_ . STO
* That day they _RARE_ around , just getting the feel of the city . STO
* They looked at the _RARE_ of the old Roman wall on the lower Via _RARE_ , then they went to the _RARE_ Gardens . STO
* She had some amusing scandal about the _RARE_ in the old days . STO
* Then they took a taxi to _RARE_ . STO
* `` There's a church you should see '' , she said . STO
* And when they stood by the fountain in the _RARE_ looking at _RARE_ _RARE_ he had to keep a straight face , not letting on he had been there with _RARE_ . STO
* He let her tell him all about the church . STO
* Then they had dinner . STO
* All evening she was _RARE_ and pleased with herself . STO
* When they got home at midnight she was tired out . STO
* And in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing . STO
* He had never heard so many bells , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her _RARE_ him for his remarks when he had looked up at the _RARE_ and the church at the top of the Spanish _RARE_ . STO
* It was a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought . STO
* She might like to take him to St. Peter's . STO
* `` Carla , wake up '' , he said shaking her . STO
* `` It's ten o'clock . STO
* _RARE_ you going out to mass ? STO
* You could take me to St. Peter's '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , she muttered . STO
* `` Come on , you'll be late '' . STO
* `` I think I'll sleep in this morning '' , she said _RARE_ , and as she _RARE_ against him , he wondered if she ever went to church . STO
* Why did he want her to go to church ? STO
* He wondered Probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security . STO
* It would be good for her . STO
* It was too bad he had no feeling himself for church . STO
* Not his poor mother's fault . STO
* She would have been better off if she had stuck to her Bible . STO
* As for himself , he just didn't have the _RARE_ for it . STO
* From the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain _RARE_ and _RARE_ by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know . STO
* Then he thought of those Old _RARE_ figures on the ceiling of the _RARE_ Chapel . STO
* Just figures out of a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Could he honestly believe it would be good for Carla to have those old _RARE_ _RARE_ her imagination now ? STO
* Being a woman though , she would take only what she needed from church . STO
* It was too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself . STO
* Or a _RARE_ , or one of those amusing _RARE_ _RARE_ , or a strict _RARE_ Communist . STO
* What was the matter with him that they all _RARE_ him ? STO
* It was the times , he was sure . STO
* All the _RARE_ changing from day to day , right under his eyes , so how could a man look to any one of them for an _RARE_ of his freedom ? STO
* It was all too _RARE_ . STO
* Look somewhere else . STO
* But where ? STO
* Just the same , he thought , _RARE_ over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she got up and went to church . STO
* A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the _RARE_ , hearing them _RARE_ down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass . STO
* It seemed to him that if the _RARE_ felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla . STO
* `` Since we're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' . STO
* And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam . STO
* There's so little to do '' . STO
* `` Why not '' ? STO
* She said . STO
* `` I'm not good at that kind of thing '' . STO
* `` This afternoon let's take an air with them . STO
* Let's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were _RARE_ . STO
* `` If you find it necessary , Sam , go ahead '' , she said , turning on the _RARE_ . STO
* `` I am what I am . STO
* I can't help it '' . STO
* Her words remained with him , worrying him for hours . STO
* He didn't know how she would behave with other people . STO
* When they walked into the _RARE_ apartment , the old lady , _RARE_ and smiling , said softly . STO
* `` _RARE_ , '' and put out her hand . STO
* Her little brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes _RARE_ , and with her little _RARE_ she said all the _RARE_ things . STO
* _RARE_ , smiling too , said , `` _RARE_ '' , and then more slowly , `` I am happy '' . STO
* And they sat down and began their little coffee party . STO
* The _RARE_ offered them biscuits with the coffee . STO
* Acting only as _RARE_ Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly _RARE_ . STO
* She would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again . STO
* _RARE_ her , he felt like a _RARE_ at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ her head _RARE_ , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest . STO
* Carla translated . STO
* The old woman had a nephew from North Italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the _RARE_ unemployment , and who had _RARE_ to Canada to work on the _RARE_ . STO
* For a year the boy had lived in the _RARE_ in a boxcar . STO
* Did many of _RARE_ _RARE_ live in _RARE_ in the _RARE_ ? STO
* Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar ? STO
* She wanted to know . STO
* _RARE_ Sam explained that he had no experience with _RARE_ . STO
* Just the same , the old woman said , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country . STO
* And Sam _RARE_ her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the Pope . STO
* A very great Pope , this one , the old woman explained , her black eyes _RARE_ . STO
* An intellectual . STO
* But very _RARE_ too . STO
* It was said that he had had a vision . STO
* Just as thousands that day in _RARE_ had seen the sun dancing in the sky , he had seen the same thing later in his own garden , and she turned to _RARE_ for confirmation . STO
* _RARE_ had been sitting quietly , listening with the _RARE_ of the unaware . STO
* Now a little flush came on her pale homely face and _RARE_ in her eyes . STO
* The Holy Father would die soon , she said to Carla , so she could translate for Sam , although he had a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great _RARE_ of the world . STO
* Yes , the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint . STO
* No , he was indeed a saint now . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered _RARE_ . STO
* There was a certain _RARE_ among the _RARE_ . STO
* The Pope , in the _RARE_ of his great _RARE_ , had neglected them a little . STO
* There would be changes made , and _RARE_ Raymond should understand that when the Pope died it was like the end of a _RARE_ in Rome . STO
* _RARE_ would be lost and new faces would become prominent . STO
* Did _RARE_ Raymond understand ? STO
* Indeed he did , Sam said _RARE_ , trying to get _RARE_ eye . STO
* Surely she could see that these women were her _RARE_ , too , he thought . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ and plain like a family she might meet in Brooklyn or _RARE_ or _RARE_ . STO
* But _RARE_ eyes were on _RARE_ whose _RARE_ face and _RARE_ eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness . STO
* And Carla , watching in wonder , turned to Sam . STO
* `` It means so much to her . STO
* It's like a flame , I guess '' , she said in a _RARE_ tone . STO
* But one night _RARE_ moved in the direction of the women's lodge , where _RARE_ of Night had gone to _RARE_ herself . STO
* With the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill _RARE_ the _RARE_ with his lips , making it whisper . STO
* He saw her emerge suddenly , coming in her _RARE_ fashion , her back stiff , her head erect , facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter , as if in her extreme _RARE_ and indifference she would pass by all the _RARE_ looks of those whom she might approach . STO
* In her dark , _RARE_ fashion she proceeded to her destination , afraid of nothing , not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding . STO
* Seeing her come , he caught his breath , feeling his heart _RARE_ in him , and turned away , afraid now . STO
* Even he , wanting her , afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit , feared the evil _RARE_ in her _RARE_ more . STO
* His breath caught , and , trembling , he closed his eyes and stumbled off . STO
* _RARE_ , he saw as often before some _RARE_ , hideous yellow face over his head , shining and _RARE_ like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the _RARE_ when they are perhaps pressed by the _RARE_ . STO
* He cried out to her , his back turned . STO
* Then he fled , not waiting to see if she _RARE_ him or took notice of his cry . STO
* But she heard him go . STO
* Yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly , her neck tall as she looked in his direction , and continued on her way toward the end of the camp . STO
* _RARE_ others heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their _RARE_ then gathering in small , curious _RARE_ . STO
* Early Spring came from her bed , from beside her _RARE_ husband , Walitzee , and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion , the sound of _RARE_ voices . STO
* _RARE_ there she saw _RARE_ of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost _RARE_ , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of Walitzee waited , perhaps _RARE_ the _RARE_ that moved in her . STO
* When at last she could suffer the _RARE_ no longer , nor face the girl's _RARE_ , she said in a voice _RARE_ : `` I shall call your father ! STO
* Go back where you can bring no harm , or I will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame '' ! STO
* But the girl said only , `` Tell him I am here , that I have come '' . STO
* And it was not _RARE_ of _RARE_ she meant . STO
* But now with real anger at last , something proud and _RARE_ , Early Spring stood like a she _RARE_ before her _RARE_ and cried , `` I will not _RARE_ at you ! STO
* I will tell you to go , not begging . STO
* _RARE_ you '' ! STO
* And _RARE_ the knife she used for _RARE_ _RARE_ she stepped away from the lodge , holding the knife at her side . STO
* `` You bring only _RARE_ '' , she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the _RARE_ hunger of a wild animal . STO
* _RARE_ in a low voice of _RARE_ she went up to the girl , who stood with the same upright , _RARE_ bearing and did not even look at the knife . STO
* `` Go take _RARE_ , your evil spirit , to the young boys '' , the woman said . STO
* `` They do not have to face battle . STO
* I will not let your evil in . STO
* I will simply kill you first . STO
* Now go '' ! STO
* The other women had come close now , their voices _RARE_ together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot , their threats _RARE_ , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger felt . STO
* They picked up sticks and _RARE_ them at the girl . STO
* The sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them _RARE_ her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs . STO
* They were all shouting at her as if she were the _RARE_ of the evil she brought . STO
* But she did not move , taking the words and the sticks in that old _RARE_ of her extreme youth until suddenly _RARE_ of _RARE_ came _RARE_ among them , swinging a great _RARE_ whip . STO
* `` Go back to your _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He shouted . STO
* `` A pack of dogs makes less noise '' ! STO
* He made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming , some _RARE_ over themselves in their flight . STO
* And Early Spring seized the whip and said : `` If you must _RARE_ someone , let it be her , your daughter . STO
* _RARE_ the _RARE_ out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband '' ! STO
* But the old man turned on her , _RARE_ the whip from her hand . STO
* `` Get into your _RARE_ '' ! STO
* He spat . STO
* `` Go back to that _RARE_ man of yours who so _RARE_ his fine body among the young women . STO
* Keep him back , if you must tell me what to do . STO
* I will be the one to _RARE_ my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to sin '' ! STO
* She retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where Walitzee stirred , _RARE_ , sitting up in a half _RARE_ to say : `` What _RARE_ thing happens ? STO
* I thought I dreamed of _RARE_ fighting '' . STO
* But she went to him and pressed herself against his _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ odor of the whisky he had stolen from _RARE_ . STO
* She said , `` There is nothing that concerns you here . STO
* _RARE_ back and go to sleep . STO
* But do not dream . STO
* Do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain '' . STO
* He sank back , _RARE_ , and was soon asleep again . STO
* Outside , the old man , beyond all the _RARE_ of the spirits his daughter bore , went to her and twisted the _RARE_ _RARE_ of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her _RARE_ ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms . STO
* And , shoving her against a _RARE_ , her back to him , he retreated with the whip and made it _RARE_ and crack in the damp air , _RARE_ its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it _RARE_ and cracked , settling its own cruel _RARE_ on her shoulders while she stood as _RARE_ , as dark and motionless as ever , her eyes open and staring at the pale _RARE_ of the bark so close to her face . STO
* She said to him , her father , `` How was I _RARE_ , in pain or joy ? STO
* Is it for me to be _RARE_ the flesh you made grow on me ? STO
* They all know your foolish name '' ! STO
* She stared at the pale _RARE_ on the tree , hearing her breath _RARE_ from it , her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark . STO
* She felt the _RARE_ bite and heard her father say in _RARE_ _RARE_ words which had no meaning , like , `` _RARE_ ! STO
* _RARE_ '' ! STO
* The sounds of an animal in rage and despair . STO
* Suddenly the _RARE_ stopped fighting the air and she heard _RARE_ of _RARE_ say in his high , _RARE_ voice : `` Did you follow me to see my shame ? STO
* _RARE_ from the line or I will settle the whip on you . STO
* _RARE_ ! STO
* Do you hear the anger of the _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Turning , the girl saw _RARE_ standing between , his narrow shoulders _RARE_ , his arms hanging long and _RARE_ . STO
* He said , `` Let me take her _RARE_ , for there are _RARE_ in me too '' . STO
* Then , without knowing why , she found herself running from them , fleeing wildly through the trees , _RARE_ her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and _RARE_ , listening to the _RARE_ of her heart and wanting for once to cry . STO
* For a while the young men waited outside the lodge of _RARE_ , _RARE_ in his _RARE_ language as he talked with himself . STO
* He shouted like a hoarse old _RARE_ , his hair stiff and _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ and _RARE_ the _RARE_ of his enemies , walking in circles in and out of his living place , drinking stolen whisky in great , gasping _RARE_ until finally , _RARE_ and sick , he fell into his own _RARE_ . STO
* He amused the young men who had been silent long enough . STO
* But they could taste the _RARE_ of violence and _RARE_ through his _RARE_ . STO
* Now they moved , rubbing their flesh alive again , _RARE_ the gloom they saw in the faces around them . STO
* They came out and held their games and races . STO
* It was they who held the future in their hands . STO
* They went into the sun together and _RARE_ _RARE_ in their war clothes , painting their faces with the sacred _RARE_ dug far off in the cave of _RARE_ . STO
* They danced the _RARE_ wildly at night , the war dance , and _RARE_ their _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift _RARE_ , firing their few guns in _RARE_ at some _RARE_ signal . STO
* Walitzee was among them , and _RARE_ , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing . STO
* And a very young one , _RARE_ _RARE_ , tried to _RARE_ them and followed _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ was there , nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead , in whom also the _RARE_ _RARE_ of youth worked . STO
* He would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with _RARE_ , because something had _RARE_ over in his _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* All the young men , _RARE_ among them , challenged them in matched racing . STO
* They raced and _RARE_ for war , swinging their horses in single file and then _RARE_ like _RARE_ . STO
* At times they would ride _RARE_ through the camp , letting the women see their courage , how handsome they were in their _RARE_ . STO
* Then again they would stand in circles making other preparations . STO
* They _RARE_ their hair and _RARE_ it at the part and _RARE_ the _RARE_ so that the hair above their _RARE_ stood rigid like the tails of _RARE_ _RARE_ making love . STO
* Walitzee _RARE_ his _RARE_ with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees . STO
* He saw himself in a superior reflection , and he was as a _RARE_ arrow from the taut bow , _RARE_ with a mad grace , his _RARE_ shining and scented with meadow _RARE_ . STO
* He was always aware of the women's eyes which followed him , _RARE_ him . STO
* And the suspicious , _RARE_ eyes of _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* And those of Early Spring , haunted and now full of hurt and _RARE_ . STO
* He felt so much like laughing ; ; even like shouting and crying out from the _RARE_ from which he could _RARE_ as an _RARE_ in a mad _RARE_ from the _RARE_ . STO
* He and _RARE_ planned a great parade with the young men . STO
* They would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their _RARE_ . STO
* They would ride with streaming _RARE_ , their colors _RARE_ in the sun , shouting the last _RARE_ of a nation in the _RARE_ of death . STO
* And so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood , shifting then into the full heat and _RARE_ which ran with their hearts . STO
* They mounted their horses and rode off into the hills . STO
* The , young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening . STO
* The sound rose on the other side of the hills , vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad , _RARE_ hoofs of the _RARE_ , horses the white men once had called the _RARE_ of Hell . STO
* He saw them in _RARE_ images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge . STO
* _RARE_ then with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , _RARE_ _RARE_ , their hair flying like dark _RARE_ , only the thunder , the roll of _RARE_ , the mad _RARE_ of the hoofs accompanying them . STO
* They leaned into the wind and seemed like one _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ until suddenly they rose straight in their _RARE_ and in one terrifying voice shouted , _RARE_ their _RARE_ cry of war . STO
* She was moving through a screen of _RARE_ , in among the white _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The sounds from the quarry began to _RARE_ in her ears . STO
* She stood , once more listening . STO
* She had never been here at this hour . STO
* She felt as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would _RARE_ at her arm ; ; but she found the path she always used , the _RARE_ of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ; and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark _RARE_ of water beneath her . STO
* If I ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days . STO
* She smiled , and _RARE_ let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her _RARE_ sliding in the leaves . STO
* She jumped out onto the flat _RARE_ of rock and , _RARE_ herself , shook her _RARE_ brown hair and tilted her chin far upward . STO
* The _RARE_ music of the _RARE_ had faded , but presently it began again , growing in volume until it was _RARE_ . STO
* Julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and _RARE_ her hands tightly around the bent knees . STO
* She had accomplished a _RARE_ . STO
* This was her place . STO
* The hour couldn't change it . STO
* Only -- only -- her thoughts were a little strange . STO
* They were becoming confused . STO
* Perhaps it was because it was so late , and because she had no business to be here now . STO
* She was thinking of Paul a few weeks ago , in the _RARE_ _RARE_ , with her at one of those awful Friday _RARE_ _RARE_ Class parties her mother had made her attend . STO
* `` Hello , Julie , how are you '' ? STO
* And then off he went so casually , to someone else with breasts better developed , more obvious in a _RARE_ dress , someone without a _RARE_ of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him . STO
* I wish he was with me now , she thought , and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Oh God ! STO
* I wish I were older or younger , Julia _RARE_ thought . STO
* I wish so much someone loved me . STO
* George _RARE_ remembered seeing the door open _RARE_ during the night -- _RARE_ , in a white _RARE_ , standing like a ghost at the threshold . STO
* She had vanished ; ; he must have slept again . STO
* He was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him . STO
* It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ; but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday morning . STO
* This room was like a prison . STO
* He would not be _RARE_ to Sam ! STO
* Below him , as if at the end of some remote tunnel , he heard the humming of a vacuum _RARE_ . STO
* His fingers fumbled across the _RARE_ . STO
* They had left both of his eyes _RARE_ . STO
* Well , he told himself , let's put the show on the road . STO
* He was walking across to the bathroom . STO
* He drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands . STO
* A _RARE_ pain had come from his head , as if the water were _RARE_ up through the blood vessels and expanding them . STO
* He recognized his jacket and trousers . STO
* The fabric was dark ; ; the stains weren't too apparent ; ; and there were his shoes , thank God , but his shirt was one terrible mess . STO
* He _RARE_ , and then tore away the _RARE_ parts and wound the rest around his neck like a _RARE_ . STO
* Sam would be amazed to find him gone . STO
* _RARE_ would have to understand . STO
* She must have put his clothes in the closet . STO
* He found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of _RARE_ . STO
* He was on the _RARE_ of tears . STO
* Alex _RARE_ -- in a fashion he owed a _RARE_ to that _RARE_ gentleman . STO
* At least Alex had told him he wasn't dying . STO
* Perhaps George _RARE_ would be better off dead . STO
* What time was it ? STO
* He peered at his _RARE_ . STO
* Strange , it was still running . STO
* A quarter to seven . STO
* Too early for a vacuum _RARE_ , but probably Sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs . STO
* He was _RARE_ to tie his _RARE_ . STO
* His fingers felt _RARE_ thick and _RARE_ . STO
* He rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door . STO
* He barely knew himself . STO
* This was some _RARE_ , two _RARE_ of adhesive tape across his nose , like ugly roots from the mass of _RARE_ , suddenly moist over his cheekbones . STO
* The surface , however , was perfectly white . STO
* He was drinking another glass of water . STO
* It was after seven o'clock . STO
* He was supposed to be in court this afternoon , at City Hall . STO
* Who would take over ? STO
* He'd have to think , but the main thing , the _RARE_ necessity , was to leave before Sam _RARE_ was up and about , and before _RARE_ _RARE_ him with sympathy . STO
* He entered the hallway . STO
* He was actually walking down the stairs . STO
* A plane up in the sky , above the clouds , and this _RARE_ wreck of a man desperately trying to get away . STO
* `` Father , is that you '' ? STO
* The voice issued from the _RARE_ of the hall below . STO
* George did not reply . STO
* `` Is that you , Father ? STO
* Who's there '' ? STO
* For a moment he felt like a thief discovered . STO
* Then Julia appeared under the _RARE_ leading to the dining room . STO
* She stood _RARE_ at him . STO
* `` Uncle George '' ! STO
* He was trying to smile at her . STO
* `` _RARE_ ! STO
* You shouldn't be up , should you '' ? STO
* `` I -- I was just leaving here , Julie . STO
* I'm all set . STO
* Just about to call a taxi '' . STO
* She was wearing some sort of gray _RARE_ . STO
* She seemed _RARE_ tall , her brow knitted in concern . STO
* `` Well , at least you won't have to do that '' , she was saying . STO
* `` I'm about to leave myself . STO
* I'll drop you off '' . STO
* `` You're leaving '' ? STO
* `` I'm going back to school '' , she answered . STO
* `` _RARE_ driving me . STO
* I'm just _RARE_ breakfast . STO
* But have you told Mother you were going '' ? STO
* She asked him . STO
* `` No . STO
* I just don't want anyone disturbed , Julie . STO
* That's my wish . STO
* It's quite a big one '' , he added . STO
* Her face seemed to _RARE_ in an _RARE_ bright shaft of sunlight . STO
* `` Well , won't you come in then , have a cup of coffee -- or something ? STO
* Or maybe a drink '' ? STO
* She asked , in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated , _RARE_ , and yet perhaps partly _RARE_ . STO
* He tried to see her face more clearly . STO
* `` No -- nothing at all '' , he said after a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` I'll just wait for you here '' . STO
* He leaned his head against the wood _RARE_ behind him , but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids . STO
* He raised them . STO
* Julia moved past . STO
* `` I have to say _RARE_ upstairs . STO
* I won't be long '' . STO
* `` As a great favor , Julie '' , he said , `` please don't mention you've seen me '' . STO
* `` Not to anyone '' ? STO
* `` No -- please . STO
* `` I'll call your mother as soon as I get home . STO
* It'll be so much easier '' . STO
* `` All right '' She was staring at him . STO
* `` I'm fine , Julie . STO
* Please , you just go ahead '' . STO
* She had disappeared . STO
* He could feel a _RARE_ _RARE_ against the _RARE_ . STO
* He imagined _RARE_ voice : `` George , what the hell goes on '' ? STO
* I wouldn't have the strength to answer , he thought . STO
* Maybe I couldn't have called a taxi . STO
* He could hear the footsteps overhead . STO
* He saw the suitcase , which Julia was holding . STO
* He stood up . STO
* `` I'll take that , Julie -- for you '' . STO
* `` Oh no '' , she said . STO
* `` I can manage '' . STO
* She went ahead of him . STO
* Outside the Lincoln was parked . STO
* He could hardly believe he was getting in . STO
* _RARE_ was _RARE_ at him in an _RARE_ , _RARE_ fashion ; ; but that didn't matter . STO
* We'll drop Mr. _RARE_ off in _RARE_ '' , Julia said , and for the _RARE_ second George was reminded of her father's tone with servants . STO
* To the manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this ; ; yet her _RARE_ seemed forced or _RARE_ . STO
* He could not stop to analyze . STO
* He had never felt particularly close to her . STO
* _RARE_ seemed more _RARE_ , but obviously Julia had respected his request . STO
* He took her hand . STO
* `` I wish I didn't have to go back to school '' , she said , and then , `` I wish you lived in New York . STO
* That's in the opposite direction '' . STO
* `` I wish I did '' , he responded . STO
* `` I wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume , and that we could go to a theater together , or a nice restaurant , forget we knew '' He stopped speaking . STO
* `` _RARE_ we ever knew what '' ? STO
* `` Oh , just sort of everything in general '' . STO
* She said nothing until _RARE_ had _RARE_ their pace . STO
* `` I know you feel badly , but that sounds like such a _RARE_ thing for you to say '' . STO
* `` Does it '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` Yes , perhaps . STO
* I'm supposed to joke about things , aren't I ? STO
* But sometimes life can be rather a _RARE_ business '' . STO
* His voice seemed thick and _RARE_ . STO
* He _RARE_ her hand . STO
* He could see the stone building where he lived . STO
* Just a few more steps . STO
* _RARE_ he reached into his pocket . STO
* Yes , there was the key . STO
* `` Are you positive you'll be all right by yourself '' ? STO
* She asked him . STO
* For a moment he smiled . STO
* `` Yes , Julie dear . STO
* You've done me the greatest possible service . STO
* By myself I'll be fine '' . STO
* `` Take care of yourself then '' . STO
* `` I will . STO
* You , also . STO
* Don't work too hard '' . STO
* It was an automatic phrase ; ; as he crossed through the _RARE_ he _RARE_ it . STO
* He should have discovered a more tender farewell . STO
* Someone shouted at him , `` Well ! STO
* Will you look at George _RARE_ ! STO
* What happened to you '' ? STO
* `` I _RARE_ into a door handle '' , George said . STO
* Someone laughed . STO
* George walked steadily ahead into his entry . STO
* His _RARE_ seemed on fire . STO
* He had shut his door with the brass number _RARE_ to it . STO
* In the _RARE_ the raw whiskey made him _RARE_ . STO
* Just one or two _RARE_ , he told himself , enough to _RARE_ some of the pain . STO
* He was _RARE_ . STO
* `` No , _RARE_ , I'm home . STO
* No , really , right as rain . STO
* Tell Sam not to worry about the car . STO
* I'll get it _RARE_ away . STO
* No , please -- no visit today -- I'll be asleep . STO
* For God's sake , don't worry . STO
* That _RARE_ me more than anything . STO
* Yes , sure , I'll see the doctor -- this evening , if you insist . STO
* '' There was one more call to make . STO
* `` Joan , did I wake you '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` Yes , I thought you'd probably be up . STO
* Look , _RARE_ , some fool was . STO
* _RARE_ to be driving somewhat _RARE_ last night . STO
* Unfortunately it turned out to be me , but I wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss . STO
* Oh hell no , I'm not in a hospital . STO
* I won't be in town for a couple of days , though , and there's that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon . STO
* Too bad a jury isn't involved . STO
* I might struggle in for a jury . STO
* I'd win hands down . STO
* But I thought maybe Tony _RARE_ could _RARE_ for me . STO
* He'll understand -- you might give him sort of a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* He's got all the facts . STO
* I wouldn't want to ask for a _RARE_ -- it's really just a routine thing . STO
* What ? STO
* No , darling I'd rather you didn't come out '' . STO
* A smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape . STO
* `` Don't even send flowers . STO
* I'll see you Wednesday . STO
* I'll _RARE_ you with a nice '' -- He was about to say `` double _RARE_ '' but thought better of it . STO
* `` I'll take you out to dinner . STO
* Okay ? STO
* '' He had put down the receiver . STO
* A strange relationship between Joan _RARE_ and himself . STO
* Who knew about it ? STO
* She lived alone in the older part of the city , in one of those _RARE_ houses whose brick _RARE_ some early _RARE_ had constructed . STO
* She had two tiny rooms on the second floor . STO
* She was a _RARE_ girl , a most efficient secretary . STO
* She let him come and go as he pleased , or as it pleased her . STO
* In the office you might have thought them only casual friends ; ; yet if he said : Make an excuse yourself , come out here today , she would have been on the next train -- and , similarly , if she had been in need , he would have gone to her . STO
* `` They make us _RARE_ look good '' . STO
* `` That's a peculiar way to think '' . STO
* It wasn't just the _RARE_ birds that had _RARE_ her own feathers , of course ; ; she knew that . STO
* It was _RARE_ `` little '' sister Myra , the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , forever _RARE_ , Myra . STO
* She's a year older than I am , Lucy told herself . STO
* `` Come , come '' , Jim said , _RARE_ Lucy a little . STO
* `` I love you . STO
* Susan ready '' ? STO
* Lucy listened . STO
* Obviously , Susan was not . STO
* _RARE_ , busy feet , _RARE_ like _RARE_ , _RARE_ around her room . STO
* Susan would be visiting her _RARE_ for only a few days , but even at seven she was a _RARE_ soul ; ; she always packed for a _RARE_ , just in case . STO
* `` Not yet . STO
* Every _RARE_ in the house must be going with her '' . STO
* `` She'd better step on it . STO
* It's a long way to _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ fine young face was an _RARE_ one , too ; ; as he looked at her , it registered anxiety . STO
* `` You know '' , he said . STO
* `` Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy . STO
* It'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris -- but even so , she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful '' . STO
* Lucy did not believe him ; ; Myra appreciated nothing . STO
* Jim had put the thanks in his _RARE_ mouth . STO
* `` Darling '' -- she said , and the single word _RARE_ love and _RARE_ in an equal _RARE_ . STO
* `` She should have told me herself . STO
* And will it be only a couple of weeks ? STO
* Remember what happened the last time '' ? STO
* Leaving Cathy with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ; but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them . STO
* Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come home if _RARE_ , _RARE_ husband , hadn't gone out to _RARE_ her . STO
* `` That was an awfully long two weeks '' . STO
* For an otherwise silent moment , _RARE_ keys _RARE_ _RARE_ in his pocket . STO
* `` But she promised -- This will be different '' , he said at last . STO
* `` You've got to admit she was smart to _RARE_ up this fine government job over there -- _RARE_ get a home for herself and Cathy in no time . STO
* You'll see , _RARE_ settling down '' . STO
* On the defensive , he added , `` I wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg , to be a new widow , a young widow '' . STO
* `` It depends on the widow '' . STO
* Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it . STO
* And not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down . STO
* It seemed to Lucy that all their married life , she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life . STO
* _RARE_ that succession of _RARE_ , she now considered Cathy , an ominous _RARE_ on her horizon . STO
* It was not that she disliked Cathy . STO
* The _RARE_ drew her , troubled her depths ; ; whenever Lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or _RARE_ , to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra . STO
* But Cathy was _RARE_ responsibility , not hers . STO
* `` I wouldn't even be surprised '' , she said _RARE_ , `` if Myra tried to leave her with us forever '' . STO
* Myra loved big cities ; ; thousands of miles away -- in Paris , of all places -- she might forget she had ever been a mother . STO
* Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible . STO
* `` That's a horrible thing to accuse her of '' ! STO
* Jim was so _RARE_ it was obvious that no matter what he said , he too had seen the looming _RARE_ of a _RARE_ . STO
* He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , _RARE_ , `` Susan ! STO
* Susan ! STO
* Get moving '' ! STO
* A startled _RARE_ sound returned . STO
* `` Don't yell at Susan '' , Lucy said . STO
* Was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the _RARE_ river ? STO
* Their arms around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future ; ; their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as _RARE_ in light , as the air around them . STO
* Then , from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had _RARE_ ; ; Myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line . STO
* Jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her . STO
* His dark _RARE_ , which had been lowered in anger , smoothed . STO
* `` Please '' , he said . STO
* `` There isn't a chance of _RARE_ letting anything like that happen . STO
* Let's stay friends '' . STO
* But they weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ; they were husband and wife , and Myra had no right _RARE_ and _RARE_ their marriage . STO
* The only thing that had ever come between them was that _RARE_ , _RARE_ sister of his . STO
* Lucy was sick of it . STO
* `` Well , at last '' , she said , because Susan was _RARE_ down the stairs . STO
* Susan looked like an _RARE_ baby nurse ; ; her arms were straining with a burden of dolls . STO
* `` I'm ready '' , she announced . STO
* `` Do you need that big bundle '' ? STO
* Jim said . STO
* His voice had sharp edges , as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment . STO
* `` All that _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that _RARE_ an instant grief ; ; to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart . STO
* `` Now , now '' , Lucy said , approaching Susan with a handkerchief , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` Your father didn't mean it , Susan '' . STO
* She gave Jim a quick , _RARE_ look of warning . STO
* `` She'll take every one of them '' . STO
* Jim _RARE_ , but he lifted _RARE_ suitcase and said , in a _RARE_ tone , `` Sure -- the entire thousand . STO
* And when you get back from _RARE_ , Cathy will be here to play with you . STO
* _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` No '' , Susan said , _RARE_ with her _RARE_ _RARE_ of dolls with a _RARE_ effect . STO
* And at this point , Lucy thought , there should be a lecture on little _RARE_ sharing dolls -- but she could _RARE_ with Susan ; ; there ought to be a limit to sharing , too . STO
* That was one more reason she didn't look forward to _RARE_ visit , short or long ; ; the last one had been a _RARE_ war . STO
* She suspected that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had . STO
* `` Well '' , Jim said , out of the silence , `` let's get going , dolls and all '' . STO
* When the car , with _RARE_ hands waving wildly from the rear window , disappeared down the driveway , Lucy stood looking after its pale dust . STO
* The day was brilliant around her -- _RARE_ , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil darkened it . STO
* She had let Jim go with a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ kiss . STO
* She was sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that . STO
* She turned and began to walk toward the house . STO
* At the feeding station , the _RARE_ group of _RARE_ again _RARE_ and _RARE_ over the ground , but now , _RARE_ among them , was a beautiful red _RARE_ , _RARE_ in its _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The handsome bird was solitary ; ; its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest . STO
* She had better stay there , Lucy thought ; ; the _RARE_ female _RARE_ took instant advantage of _RARE_ without _RARE_ . STO
* Well , Lucy ? STO
* She said to herself , _RARE_ the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ . STO
* She had a day of things to do ; ; among them , she had to prepare the guest room . STO
* How long would it be occupied ? STO
* She wondered , with a _RARE_ feeling of helplessness . STO
* As long as the _RARE_ Myra chose ? STO
* For a moment , her mind returned again to the strange , flying world of birds , and she said to herself . STO
* It isn't only birds that _RARE_ their children in other _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* In the _RARE_ of late afternoon , Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room . STO
* There were new yellow curtains , bright as a child's life ought to be , a new _RARE_ , _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ , and hanging from the ceiling was an _RARE_ Mother _RARE_ _RARE_ , spinning slowly in the breeze . STO
* A row of little _RARE_ waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ; since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back , Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed . STO
* The closet was faintly _RARE_ with lavender , and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a lavender ghost : Greg's house , on the day he was _RARE_ , and the child , pale , silent , _RARE_ , watching the funeral guests with _RARE_ eyes . STO
* Many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her . STO
* Out in the hall , the upstairs phone _RARE_ , and the small ghost vanished . STO
* When she picked up the receiver , her mother's cheerful voice was there . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ calling '' , she said . STO
* `` I just thought I'd let you know . STO
* Myra dropped Cathy this morning , and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours ago . STO
* I'd have phoned sooner but I've been busy '' . STO
* `` I can imagine '' ! STO
* Susan was an active character ; ; for Mother to be able to call , Susan must be _RARE_ now , surrounded by her _RARE_ of dolls . STO
* Lucy drew out the chair and sat down ; ; she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her . STO
* You could think yourself as grown up as _RARE_ , yet the _RARE_ voice still kept its comforting magic . STO
* `` How was Cathy '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* But Myra was the _RARE_ widow I ever saw '' . STO
* On her way to the _RARE_ , on her way to Paris -- you bet , Lucy said to herself . STO
* `` I've been fixing up the guest room for Cathy '' . STO
* There was a _RARE_ pause , and then her mother said , `` How long is she supposed to stay '' ? STO
* `` Just for a couple of weeks , till Myra finds a place for them '' . STO
* `` Well '' -- This time there was a long silence , while the telephone _RARE_ faintly with a _RARE_ life . STO
* _RARE_ , Lucy stared at the _RARE_ wallpaper ; ; her mother was _RARE_ ; ; she was not usually given to mysterious _RARE_ . STO
* Was she thinking along the same lines Lucy was -- that it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good ? STO
* `` You mean once Myra gets to Paris '' ? STO
* Once the soft , pretty _RARE_ found the bright light she had always wanted ? STO
* Suddenly , _RARE_ , Lucy asked , `` Mother , do you know something I don't know '' ? STO
* Again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do . STO
* Just before Myra left -- She was saying _RARE_ to Cathy , and she didn't realize I was near '' . STO
* She hesitated , as though hunting over words and ways of putting them . STO
* `` Cathy was in tears , of course , and I heard Myra say , ' Now be good , and at _RARE_ I'll send you a wonderful present from Paris ' '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ , Lucy sat there . STO
* Then she jumped to her feet , the elastic phone cord _RARE_ like a black snake . STO
* `` _RARE_ ! STO
* '' Then it was no _RARE_ she had dreamed up ; ; it was only too true . STO
* Myra had no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks . STO
* For a moment , anger darkened the hallway about her , and when she found her voice , anger _RARE_ it . STO
* `` That does it '' ! STO
* She said . STO
* `` I'll keep Cathy for two weeks . STO
* Then , if Myra does nothing about _RARE_ her , I'll pack her right back to her mother -- if I have to take her myself '' ! STO
* Her hand tightened on the receiver . STO
* `` And that's what I'm going to tell Jim '' . STO
* For Lucy , the day's nagging _RARE_ had come to an abrupt end . STO
* As she hung up , she saw through the _RARE_ open window the _RARE_ flying of the _RARE_ wings , and heard their _RARE_ singing . STO
* _RARE_ Myra ! STO
* She's not going to get away with it . STO
* Cathy is tired , Lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path . STO
* The child's thin legs were _RARE_ . STO
* She _RARE_ along slowly , both hands clutching a tired _RARE_ bear . STO
* She was at the moment just a small , walking package , being delivered to her _RARE_ and _RARE_ house . STO
* _RARE_ Susan , she was traveling light ; ; the worn _RARE_ bear , a tiny suitcase that Jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had . STO
* Lucy glancing at the _RARE_ case , knew there would not be enough in it for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ ; ; they would have to buy things for her . STO
* She opened the door . STO
* _RARE_ , the dog _RARE_ on the sand . STO
* Quint couldn't blame Maggie for _RARE_ . STO
* For eleven days they'd done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before _RARE_ Beach got _RARE_ with tourists and beach balls and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ sand made _RARE_ limp more pronounced . STO
* They walked slowly past the _RARE_ _RARE_ -- eleven lemon , nine _RARE_ , seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` _RARE_ '' sign _RARE_ in the wind . STO
* Now they were in friendly territory . STO
* Nobody around . STO
* Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks _RARE_ _RARE_ to the _RARE_ edge . STO
* His rock was to the right of a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a big , brown , _RARE_ rock _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* His rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here . STO
* Here he was enclosed and safe . STO
* ( If a _RARE_ or a sea _RARE_ came along , didn't he have a red _RARE_ hunting knife on his belt -- ten _RARE_ and a _RARE_ ? STO
* ) Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe . STO
* He was _RARE_ controlling the waves . STO
* He was a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Table , `` Sir _RARE_ the _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ evil spirits and _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* ( One good thing about a suit of _RARE_ , his leg wouldn't show . STO
* ) He was the first _RARE_ on the moon , chosen because of his small size and _RARE_ nature . STO
* He was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a _RARE_ chest , a man the weak and _RARE_ would turn to . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* Every night when he wanted a drink of water , didn't he practice being _RARE_ by not turning on the bathroom light ? STO
* A dark bathroom can be pretty _RARE_ , and he'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : _RARE_ , for sure , I'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad . STO
* He hadn't intended to make the promise . STO
* It happened two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to South America . STO
* Every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ; and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` Stop screaming , Quint . STO
* It's all right . STO
* Stop shaking '' . STO
* He could remember the feel of his father's big hands , the _RARE_ of his father's heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar . STO
* `` Let's talk about the beach . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* While I'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ? STO
* Look , I can put two fingers between the _RARE_ in the back of your neck . STO
* Dr. _RARE_ says swimming would help your leg . STO
* He says you're _RARE_ more than you need to '' . STO
* `` How does he know ? STO
* Big dumb nut . STO
* He never had _RARE_ '' . STO
* In the light from the _RARE_ table his father looked so worried that the promise _RARE_ out . STO
* `` You just wait , Dad . STO
* When you get back I'll _RARE_ be swimming better than Victoria . STO
* Wait and see , Dad '' . STO
* Victoria was fourteen months younger than Quint , a head taller , and could _RARE_ any boy or girl on the beach . STO
* He called her `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* She called him `` _RARE_ -- that's why nobody plays with you , Mister _RARE_ '' . STO
* Or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at _RARE_ : `` Please , Lord _RARE_ , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised '' . STO
* `` She's got a nerve '' . STO
* Quint said now to the clouds . STO
* _RARE_ began to _RARE_ up and down his chest . STO
* He felt strong as a giant . STO
* He _RARE_ his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg . STO
* He _RARE_ his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' , creaked a sea _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ , shut up '' , he said . STO
* He stood on the rock , a skinny , dignified boy surrounded by the ocean . STO
* The wind _RARE_ a hole between his shoulder _RARE_ , and when he looked at the _RARE_ waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , _RARE_ between the rocks and the waves . STO
* I can't go in . STO
* I'm scared of the nightmare . STO
* _RARE_ , he put on his clothes . STO
* And shivering with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water . STO
* `` _RARE_ it , big shot '' , a hoarse voice yelled back . STO
* She was holding on to his rock with one hand . STO
* She smelled of _RARE_ . STO
* She wore a bathing suit like his mother's , no _RARE_ on the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Why didn't you duck '' ? STO
* He snapped . STO
* `` This is my rock '' . STO
* `` Isn't '' . STO
* `` Is '' . STO
* `` Isn't '' . STO
* `` Is '' . STO
* She was sore as a boil . STO
* `` Ever hear of _RARE_ rights '' ? STO
* `` Sure . STO
* They started with the _RARE_ Bill of eighteen '' -- `` Mister Big _RARE_ , aren't you '' ? STO
* `` I'm Mark _RARE_ _RARE_ the Fifth . STO
* They call me Quint '' . STO
* `` Then why don't you stop _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` I said Quint . STO
* That's short for _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ in Latin means '' -- `` I can speak both kinds of Latin , smart _RARE_ '' . STO
* Her cough sounded like cloth _RARE_ . STO
* `` You shouldn't smoke so much '' , he said , unconsciously _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ voice . STO
* `` I don't smoke '' . STO
* She was _RARE_ . STO
* `` Do you '' ? STO
* `` Hell , yes '' . STO
* Not having said `` hell '' before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum . STO
* `` Sometimes eleven , fourteen a day '' . STO
* `` If I was your _RARE_ , I'd _RARE_ your tail off '' . STO
* `` My mother never _RARE_ me . STO
* I've got this leg brace '' . STO
* She seemed so _RARE_ that he was obliged to roll up his blue _RARE_ so she could see his brace . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , was what she said . STO
* `` Why don't you paint it red and white like a _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Because maybe I won't have to wear it always . STO
* Dr. _RARE_ says if I exercise my leg more , maybe I can use a cane when I'm big '' . STO
* She _RARE_ a _RARE_ of water into the air . STO
* `` A _RARE_ mighty _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ walking past , you want to stop him , _RARE_ , _RARE_ him around the neck with the _RARE_ in your cane . STO
* Or say a _RARE_ brings you a bowl of _RARE_ with a dead fly in it -- all you got to do is _RARE_ , _RARE_ your cane on the floor . STO
* Hey , will you look at that '' ? STO
* Maggie had shaken himself awake and was _RARE_ the sand off his _RARE_ _RARE_ and his long _RARE_ of a tail . STO
* `` That's some dog . STO
* What kind '' ? STO
* `` Part _RARE_ , part _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* Quint _RARE_ . STO
* He always did when people asked . STO
* `` Holy _RARE_ , that's the most unique dog I ever saw '' , she said firmly . STO
* `` His real _RARE_ _RARE_ , only we call him Maggie because he has to take _RARE_ . STO
* He's _RARE_ than he looks . STO
* He's been sick lately . STO
* Last Tuesday he went on a ham _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` A what '' ? STO
* He would have told her , but Victoria was _RARE_ . STO
* That meant `` Mama wants you Quint . STO
* Come home or I'll come find you '' . STO
* `` I _RARE_ go . STO
* Even though this is my rock , you can use it sometimes . STO
* I come early in the morning '' . STO
* `` So do I . STO
* See you around , Mister _RARE_ '' . STO
* That was how they started being friends . STO
* They met next morning and all the mornings thereafter . STO
* Same time , early , before the fog burned off , because she didn't like the sun ; ; it made her _RARE_ . STO
* Her name was Sabella , and the strip of _RARE_ around her neck was an _RARE_ _RARE_ the King gave her as a _RARE_ of his _RARE_ love . STO
* `` You going to marry the King '' ? STO
* `` No . STO
* He's got a long beard and _RARE_ his teeth with a fork . STO
* My hair is what he's _RARE_ about . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ hair runs in my family . STO
* _RARE_ , I prefer straight hair like yours , but as they say on the _RARE_ , ' What can one do ' '' ? STO
* `` Which _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ one , I been there '' . STO
* Japan , she said , smelled _RARE_ because people let dead fish lie on the _RARE_ till the fish got hard as rocks ; ; then they scraped off the mold and made fish _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ in _RARE_ had _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ drove their _RARE_ down to the beach and _RARE_ and drank and fought all night . STO
* As for dancing -- _RARE_ _RARE_ , he ought to see the _RARE_ in _RARE_ ; ; they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them . STO
* `` Really '' . STO
* Quint _RARE_ a _RARE_ . STO
* She made better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so . STO
* _RARE_ , as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the Navy _RARE_ in the _RARE_ War ; ; that his baby sister could _RARE_ up through her nose when she felt like it ; ; that he personally had an _RARE_ of _RARE_ and was currently reading the _RARE_ to _RARE_ volume of the _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ are for _RARE_ '' . STO
* She skipped a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , hoarse laugh he liked to hear . STO
* Nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as Sabella . STO
* ( `` What did one _RARE_ say to the other _RARE_ ? STO
* Let's get dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight '' . STO
* And `` What time did the _RARE_ go to the dentist ? STO
* _RARE_ '' . STO
* ) _RARE_ by her _RARE_ he _RARE_ Maggie who was crazy about ham . STO
* He described the ham _RARE_ with _RARE_ and _RARE_ , cooling on the porch . STO
* He _RARE_ up on the ham like Maggie , _RARE_ it with soft , _RARE_ teeth , then panting with _RARE_ , _RARE_ up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , _RARE_ home to be sick , while his mother said , `` That does it . STO
* That dog has to go '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , you're quite a comic '' , Sabella said _RARE_ . STO
* `` Ever thought about going on the stage '' ? STO
* He hadn't . STO
* But it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head . STO
* `` _RARE_ that or a _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Better make up your mind , son '' , Sabella said . STO
* `` You can't serve _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' . STO
* Sometimes they argued . STO
* She said _RARE_ have no bones and _RARE_ swam backward . STO
* His _RARE_ agreed with Sabella . STO
* Next morning he tied a bunch of sea _RARE_ with string and threw them across the _RARE_ _RARE_ to the rock where she was swimming around . STO
* _RARE_ , could she catch ! STO
* Like _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Nobody gave me flowers before . STO
* Thank you , Quint '' . STO
* Her face turned pink with pleasure and a _RARE_ cough . STO
* `` You can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain _RARE_ _RARE_ say _RARE_ '' . STO
* Sometimes they didn't talk at all . STO
* He _RARE_ on the rock while she swam and _RARE_ around . STO
* Once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , `` Don't feel like it '' , he was _RARE_ to tell her about being scared . STO
* But Victoria began _RARE_ just then and he went home , carrying Sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* As for his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , _RARE_ of time . STO
* Wednesday morning it happened . STO
* They were eating breakfast . STO
* `` We _RARE_ _RARE_ , Lord _RARE_ , to _RARE_ this food '' -- that was Victoria saying grace while the baby _RARE_ _RARE_ toast on her plastic _RARE_ . STO
* Same old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement . STO
* `` Your _RARE_ in San Francisco '' , she told them . STO
* `` He says he'll be here on the _RARE_ plane . STO
* Fifteen days early -- isn't that wonderful '' ? STO
* `` Yeah , keen '' . STO
* A cave seemed to be opening in _RARE_ stomach . STO
* `` Children , we'll have to get organized . STO
* The baby can have an early _RARE_ . STO
* Victoria , I want you to -- '' Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldn't be scared . STO
* `` _RARE_ up , we're late '' , he said , _RARE_ with a chill how gray the sky was this morning , the fog like a rope along the horizon , the _RARE_ waves sending off sheets of blue and _RARE_ green . STO
* The cave in his stomach hurt . STO
* He had to go into the water . STO
* He'd tell Sabella about the nightmare . STO
* It had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung . STO
* What caused it , he didn't know . STO
* The metal collar _RARE_ his neck ? STO
* _RARE_ so much ? STO
* The unbearable weight on his chest ? STO
* All of it together meant _RARE_ . STO
* The first time the nurse took him out of the lung , she said if he got frightened , she'd put him back for a second . STO
* When Bobbie Evans smashed up his car , the Jaguar his wife Linda had given him for his last birthday , and himself quite thoroughly with it , driving back from an _RARE_ golf at _RARE_ , it seemed to mark the end of a long , _RARE_ chapter in the social life of the community . STO
* Linda looked remote yet lovely in black , and everyone held his or her breath . STO
* Not that Linda was _RARE_ , not that she would do anything _RARE_ or in bad taste any more than John Cooper would . STO
* _RARE_ Linda been a perfect wife to Bobbie , who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years ? STO
* Wasn't John Cooper even more attractive at _RARE_ than he had been twenty-five years earlier ? STO
* And wasn't John's wife , Edythe , even more _RARE_ , if possible ? STO
* Didn't John Cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life ? STO
* Wasn't it adult and realistic to look at it that way ? STO
* And romantic ? STO
* Everybody knew that John Cooper had married Edythe on the _RARE_ . STO
* It was the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life , and it was a tribute to John's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his . STO
* `` Of course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , Mousie Chandler said to Linda Stuart . STO
* `` Poor John '' ! STO
* Linda accepted the _RARE_ , which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of _RARE_ when she was by all odds the _RARE_ and _RARE_ young woman west of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and John was surely one of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ young men around _RARE_ . STO
* For it had been John and Linda ever since she had come out two _RARE_ before at the _RARE_ Club to the _RARE_ _RARE_ not only of the stag line but even of her fellow _RARE_ . STO
* John had claimed her from the stag line , a young man a year out of _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ still around his eyes . STO
* You saw them always together those years . STO
* You talked about John-and-Linda as an _RARE_ . STO
* John-and-Linda were at _RARE_ _RARE_ last night ; ; John-and-Linda drove to _RARE_ in three and a half hours . STO
* Then there was a spat over something , as there had been _RARE_ _RARE_ before ; ; only this one didn't _RARE_ . STO
* You still said `` John-and-Linda '' , but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or _RARE_ . STO
* It got worse instead of better . STO
* First , it came out after Mr. _RARE_ will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that John and his mother weren't rich any more . STO
* And then there was _RARE_ engagement to Bobbie Evans . STO
* There was no connection between the two events , because Bobbie wasn't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John . STO
* He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did . STO
* Some people said Linda had just announced the engagement to _RARE_ John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to _RARE_ with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be John-and-Linda even to sentimental _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It wasn't even John and Edythe . STO
* It was simply Poor John . STO
* There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either . STO
* Mousie Chandler had been to school with her _RARE_ near Baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at _RARE_ . STO
* `` Well , you shouldn't _RARE_ Edythe '' , Mousie said . STO
* `` I know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and _RARE_ . STO
* She is frivolous and _RARE_ , but she really isn't shallow '' . STO
* Bobbie and Linda looked magnificent at their wedding . STO
* John was at the church with Edythe . STO
* She _RARE_ during the ceremony , and Mousie Chandler , who was one of _RARE_ _RARE_ , said John _RARE_ black as death at her . STO
* `` As if he were choking '' , she said . STO
* `` Poor John '' ! STO
* Edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example . STO
* Her hair never seemed to be in place and her _RARE_ were never quite the correct length . STO
* She didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at _RARE_ _RARE_ , but her bathing suits were far from smart . STO
* And you didn't see her much at _RARE_ _RARE_ or anywhere , for John had drifted away from the gang . STO
* Mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity . STO
* Others thought he couldn't stand seeing Linda , Mrs. Bobbie Evans , still so beautiful , so much in command of everything . STO
* There were _RARE_ reasons too . STO
* John's mother died not long after his marriage , and there was even less Cooper money left . STO
* John sold the big old place in _RARE_ and bought a smaller house in _RARE_ Chapel . STO
* He was not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day . STO
* John was good at his job . STO
* It probably wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the _RARE_ with nothing but Edythe to come home to . STO
* Though that may be unfair since Ben Cooper , John's first son , came along early in _RARE_ , the _RARE_ baby you ever saw and a _RARE_ that he looked all Cooper from _RARE_ to pink toes , _RARE_ a trace of Edythe . STO
* But the continuing charm of the other children -- Sally in _RARE_ and Jack in 1944 -- and all John's success at his work only made _RARE_ _RARE_ and general _RARE_ more _RARE_ . STO
* She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda . STO
* When there was bridge at _RARE_ house , the cards _RARE_ like wet _RARE_ _RARE_ and the food probably was wet _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* She managed a _RARE_ drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , who'd never _RARE_ more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what Edythe called `` the _RARE_ of the church '' . STO
* John did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually _RARE_ , which was a real bit of luck for the _RARE_ . STO
* Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile . STO
* Poor John was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without _RARE_ and maybe _RARE_ over backward to keep a bad one . STO
* He was an _RARE_ and generous husband , _RARE_ , a lot of people felt , because they knew that money must be a problem to him . STO
* But he got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ; after the war back to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the steel company . STO
* The _RARE_ saw Bobbie and Linda socially , but no more than was necessary . STO
* Bobbie had been successful , too , though he didn't match John's pace , and after all he didn't need to , with all the Stuart money . STO
* He and Linda settled down to being social leaders , and Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year . STO
* And then came the _RARE_ turn , the smashed Jaguar and Linda , _RARE_ alone and lovely . STO
* Everyone held his or her breath . STO
* `` Don't think Linda couldn't have got John back any time , if she'd tried '' , Mousie _RARE_ , who had been Mousie Chandler , said between _RARE_ of a chicken sandwich at a _RARE_ table at _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` Now you know she _RARE_ , but she isn't that kind of girl . STO
* But now -- well , it would be a _RARE_ , I think . STO
* Poor John '' . STO
* Linda Evans felt more _RARE_ than she had ever dreamed _RARE_ death could move her to feeling . STO
* What she felt was a _RARE_ loss with a sense of waste to it , not so much sorrow for handsome , ambitious Bobbie , but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death . STO
* She knew what people were thinking ; ; it was what she had been thinking herself . STO
* It was up to her to save Poor John , dear John , to _RARE_ the wrong she had done , but she trembled at the decision as at the _RARE_ of a cold stream . STO
* There was no one who would blame her or John ; ; she could be sure of that . STO
* It might be rough on Edythe at first , but Linda and John between them could make a settlement handsome enough to _RARE_ her , to send her back to _RARE_ or anywhere . STO
* And Linda felt capable of _RARE_ the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and Bobbie had had none of their own . STO
* It would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of . STO
* Linda would have to wait , she knew . STO
* But what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by ? STO
* _RARE_ of watching while Poor John struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead . STO
* Of course , he had done _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ and regular _RARE_ had different sales departments at Smith & _RARE_ , where John and Bobbie both worked . STO
* Bobbie had been head of the _RARE_ division , while John was just another good salesman in the regular branch . STO
* So when old Mr. _RARE_ , the company president , talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular _RARE_ had gone with _RARE_ , it looked like the perfect chance for Bobbie . STO
* For Linda knew how to help her husband , not just the _RARE_ contacts but also the little dinners for _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* She was almost sick when Bobbie came home with the news that Poor John had won the job . STO
* `` What did you do '' ? STO
* She asked Bobbie . STO
* `` You must have done something , something wrong . STO
* Lord knows I had everything set for you '' . STO
* Bobbie said something about damned _RARE_ sticking together , and Linda got angry at him . STO
* They had their first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk . STO
* Linda _RARE_ her uncle , Donald _RARE_ , into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened . STO
* He was a director of S. & M. and must have been in on the decision . STO
* But _RARE_ old Uncle Donald would tell her no more than that Bobbie had certainly been considered for the job , but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some _RARE_ couldn't understand . STO
* He didn't tell her of the long board meeting where Bobbie and John were weighed one against the other . STO
* `` I'm behind John Cooper '' , Mr. _RARE_ said finally . STO
* `` I think we're agreed that he and Evans are equal in ability , so we have to look at the thing in terms of _RARE_ . STO
* `` Now , I believe Poor _RARE_ work just a little harder . STO
* With that wife of his , I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance . STO
* Bobbie , with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities . STO
* And also , the money can't mean as much to Bobbie . STO
* `` Bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it ; ; Poor John will take it as a _RARE_ and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights worrying about us '' . STO
* Most of the directors nodded . STO
* Uncle Donald _RARE_ found himself _RARE_ agreement too . STO
* After the surprise was over , Linda was almost as pleased as anyone with John's good luck , though she agreed with _RARE_ decision some months later to move to _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The job at _RARE_ wasn't particularly better , but it got him away from being _RARE_ to John and assured him steady _RARE_ , since _RARE_ was owned to a large degree by various branches of _RARE_ family . STO
* Poor John's rise continued to be _RARE_ . STO
* When he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job , a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief _RARE_ in a series on national business leaders of the future . STO
* She called then to say she had a _RARE_ for that night . STO
* `` _RARE_ appreciated the chance to make some money . STO
* Such a nice little thing -- lives right in the building '' . STO
* `` That's _RARE_ '' , I said sweetly . STO
* I could get along without that three dollars . STO
* In some ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing I was no longer _RARE_ to Nadine ! STO
* It was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang . STO
* I stumbled through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour . STO
* I answered to find Nadine at the other end . STO
* `` You scared me half to death '' , I said _RARE_ . STO
* `` What's wrong '' ? STO
* `` Janice , nobody answers at the apartment '' ! STO
* Her voice came shrill . STO
* `` I'm absolutely frantic ! STO
* That stupid girl might have gone off and left _RARE_ '' ! STO
* `` Oh , she wouldn't do that '' , I said . STO
* `` She's probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone . STO
* But if you're worried you can go home and check '' -- `` I can't leave the party ! STO
* We're at Ken _RARE_ apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat ! STO
* Old Mr. Thom is already down on Wally , and we simply can't afford to get Ken mad at us '' -- I was all set for what came next . STO
* `` Janice , could you possibly go over and make sure _RARE_ all right ? STO
* I'll call you there in ten minutes '' -- `` I can't make it in ten minutes '' -- _RARE_ , as I said it , why I should make it at all . STO
* Why should I go over at midnight to check on _RARE_ , when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party ? STO
* `` Fifteen minutes , then ! STO
* Please , Janice . STO
* I'll be glad to pay you '' -- So sure that money could do anything ! STO
* `` All right '' , I said . STO
* I'd do it . STO
* Not for the dollar or so Nadine would give me . STO
* But because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if I didn't go over , who would ? STO
* Chris was sound asleep , and I didn't see any sense in waking him . STO
* I dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened . STO
* I drove off through the cool darkness to _RARE_ apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door . STO
* Her face was flushed from sleep . STO
* `` It's all right '' , I said , as she started to look scared . STO
* `` Mrs. Roberts had called , and couldn't wake you . STO
* I just came over to make sure everything was all right '' . STO
* `` I'm -- hard to wake up '' , she _RARE_ . STO
* She didn't look over _RARE_ . STO
* And Nadine insisted that her _RARE_ be reliable ! STO
* `` I have to get up early for church tomorrow '' , she went on . STO
* `` I didn't know it was going to be this late '' ! STO
* The phone started ringing . STO
* `` That's Mrs. Roberts again '' , I said . STO
* `` I'll answer it '' . STO
* I crossed the _RARE_ furnished living room to the pale yellow phone . STO
* I told Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home . STO
* `` Janice , would you mind staying '' ? STO
* There was a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she'd been crying . STO
* `` _RARE_ drunk -- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can , but I don't want _RARE_ to see him like this . STO
* You know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building '' -- Not a word of thanks for what I'd already done . STO
* The receiver clicked in my ear . STO
* She didn't even give me a chance to refuse . STO
* Well , there wasn't any law that said I had to stay ! STO
* But then I looked at _RARE_ and thought that I might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk . STO
* So I told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she _RARE_ off to her own apartment . STO
* After I looked in at _RARE_ , I went into the living room and waited . STO
* I must have _RARE_ off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices . STO
* _RARE_ , shrill with anger -- _RARE_ loud and thick -- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two . STO
* I opened the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him . STO
* I had always thought she was so beautiful . STO
* But now she looked ugly . STO
* Her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out , and if looks could kill , Wally would have been dead . STO
* `` _RARE_ your clothes '' , she _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ -- and get out '' ! STO
* `` You're crazy '' , Wally said _RARE_ . STO
* He lurched and stumbled to the _RARE_ and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep . STO
* Nadine strode over to him , and her pointed nails _RARE_ across his face . STO
* I grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right , and she was crazy . STO
* `` You stay out of this '' , she spat at me . STO
* `` He's ruined us -- do you hear me -- he's ruined us ! STO
* He _RARE_ Ken Thom '' ! STO
* Her eyes were wild . STO
* `` He told Ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman ! STO
* And the other people there were listening ! STO
* We're ruined and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs '' -- `` you'd better _RARE_ down '' , I said _RARE_ . STO
* I was plenty scared . STO
* In the state she was in , she could actually kill him ! STO
* `` Now you just take it easy , and I'll make you some tea '' -- `` _RARE_ , '' Nadine screeched . STO
* `` How can you be so damn stupid ? STO
* _RARE_ lost his job ! STO
* Ken will never forgive him -- never ! STO
* And we don't have any money -- we don't have a _RARE_ ! STO
* All we own is _RARE_ bedroom set and the _RARE_ player and we even owe on them . STO
* And we'll be poor and have to live in a _RARE_ little house like yours -- and all because of that '' -- I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of _RARE_ . STO
* `` Stop that ! STO
* You'll wake up the whole building . STO
* Wally can't go any place at this hour '' -- `` Well then , I'll get out '' -- But she looked uncertain . STO
* She was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go _RARE_ off anywhere at two in the morning . STO
* `` You go to bed '' , I said _RARE_ . STO
* `` In the morning you and Wally can talk things out '' -- She collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped . STO
* I got her into bed , and sat with her until she had _RARE_ herself out . STO
* It was three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go . STO
* I left her , a limp bundle of _RARE_ , shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her . STO
* Wally was snoring on the _RARE_ . STO
* I had done all I could . STO
* I had done all I was going to do . STO
* Whether or not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine . STO
* I drove home , found Chris still asleep . STO
* I _RARE_ up close to him -- _RARE_ him -- _RARE_ for a man like him . STO
* _RARE_ I wasn't Nadine . STO
* I kept on being _RARE_ . STO
* In the afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with _RARE_ . STO
* Wally sat in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry . STO
* `` I'd had all this trouble with the old man , that's why I drank so much . STO
* I -- got fired yesterday for not _RARE_ to business '' -- Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , Wally _RARE_ , and couldn't get one because there were cars on the _RARE_ waiting to be repaired . STO
* Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side . STO
* Mr. Thom had gotten Wally on the phone , and fired him . STO
* `` I thought I'd smooth things over through Ken '' , Wally said _RARE_ . STO
* `` But Ken got _RARE_ and wouldn't make any promises . STO
* And I was _RARE_ and I blew my stack '' -- `` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman '' ! STO
* I tried to quiet Nadine because the children were there . STO
* But she was beyond caring what she said . STO
* `` _RARE_ may smooth over yet '' , Chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern . STO
* But I couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved . STO
* Now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough . STO
* When A bubble _RARE_ , there's nothing . STO
* Little by little , during the week , Chris and I discovered the crazy _RARE_ way Nadine and Wally had lived . STO
* They had not only spent every cent -- they were in _RARE_ up to their _RARE_ , _RARE_ on everything they owned . STO
* On top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired , they were _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of all , Wally had no training for any kind of work . STO
* He had fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was _RARE_ . STO
* Chris _RARE_ . STO
* `` I wish we were in a position to offer a little money to _RARE_ them over '' . STO
* I said I wished we were , too . STO
* It was easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn't spare a cent . STO
* But Chris _RARE_ up like a candle . STO
* `` I'm glad you feel that way , honey . STO
* There is one big way we can help them . STO
* We can let them move in with us '' -- Something I had simply never thought of . STO
* Something so incredible -- I just stared at him . STO
* It was incredible -- He gave me an embarrassed , pleading look . STO
* `` I know we'd be pretty crowded . STO
* But it would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out '' . STO
* _RARE_ out -- They'd had years of making all that money ! STO
* `` I won't do it '' , I said _RARE_ . STO
* `` Nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this ! STO
* Well , now she can sleep in the street for all I care '' ! STO
* `` That isn't like you , Janice '' , Chris said _RARE_ . STO
* Then I felt uncomfortable , too . STO
* I didn't want to be like that , mean and bitter . STO
* But , _RARE_ it all , why should we help a couple of spoiled _RARE_ who had looked down their _RARE_ at us ? STO
* But , in the end , we did . STO
* It just seemed as if there was nothing else to do . STO
* The finance company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name . STO
* Then Wally got sick . STO
* To my way of thinking , he was scared sick . STO
* His luck had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world . STO
* Chris made trip after trip in our old car , moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of _RARE_ Nadine had bought on special . STO
* At least we'll eat , I thought grimly as I put all the food away . STO
* While I worked , Nadine sat and cried . STO
* When she wasn't crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ nothing '' , she'd scream at him . STO
* `` You're too lazy to go out and look for another job . STO
* You're just a _RARE_ bum '' ! STO
* It was a mess , all right . STO
* But it couldn't go on forever -- A couple of weeks , Chris had said . STO
* I figured I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks . STO
* But the two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us . STO
* _RARE_ constant nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed . STO
* He set out every morning looking for work , and come home around noon , full of _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ Thom had _RARE_ him . STO
* Nobody would even take his application . STO
* `` You can get something , '' Nadine would snap . STO
* `` You can get a job working in a _RARE_ store , if nothing else '' . STO
* `` The high school kids have got everything _RARE_ up '' , he said , a _RARE_ in his voice . STO
* `` Those damn _RARE_ -- taking work away from men who need it '' . STO
* `` By fall they'll be back in school '' , I'd say , trying to sound encouraging . STO
* But this was only the middle of July . STO
* And I couldn't take six more weeks of this . STO
* I mentioned it to Chris one _RARE_ hot night , when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air . STO
* I don't really believe in _RARE_ . STO
* But I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes , I knew it was going to be a bad day . STO
* Part of it was the weather , so _RARE_ it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital . STO
* Part of it was being so tired -- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday , but a dinner meeting as well , that kept me up late . STO
* But the rest of it , the main part , wasn't based on logic at all . STO
* It was just going to be one of those days . STO
* For the _RARE_ time , I wished I'd chosen some nice , _RARE_ , _RARE_ profession . STO
* And for the _RARE_ time , I answered myself . STO
* I hadn't chosen medicine -- it had chosen me . STO
* Actually , I shouldn't complain , I told myself in the shaving mirror . STO
* I had a lot to be _RARE_ for . STO
* A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be _RARE_ at . STO
* Maybe I didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like , but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an _RARE_ or a _RARE_ . STO
* At least , we were together and we had Mrs. _RARE_ , _RARE_ her , to look after us -- no mother could be _RARE_ of Gladdy than Mrs. _RARE_ was . STO
* I was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it . STO
* _RARE_ in the way Gladdy had turned out . STO
* _RARE_ up without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been . STO
* But I mustn't start on Alice . STO
* She is a closed book , a picture I keep on my bureau , but never look at . STO
* If she'd kept on as she'd been going , the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow As usual , _RARE_ bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table . STO
* Her first class wasn't until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with me . STO
* It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made me feel good , too . STO
* Oh , I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision . STO
* I had a feeling that young Pete _RARE_ , the most promising _RARE_ at _RARE_ , had something to do with it , too . STO
* She'd been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date _RARE_ my mood a little . STO
* But once I was alone again , driving to the hospital , the _RARE_ returned . STO
* If she and Pete were really getting serious , I'd have to do some hard thinking . STO
* Should I tell him the truth about Alice ? STO
* Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years ? STO
* The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to _RARE_ . STO
* Two _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , the other _RARE_ . STO
* I'm Chief of _RARE_ here and this morning would start like all others , with me taking the boys on the rounds . STO
* Pete was down on Seven , _RARE_ told me , and he'd meet us there . STO
* There wasn't anything of special interest that morning , no one _RARE_ than they should have been . STO
* Pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven -- he'd had a case of _RARE_ shock , but it was all taken care of now . STO
* Seven is a women's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then . STO
* When we'd finished our regular rounds , Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor . STO
* `` Got a new one in last night '' , he said . STO
* `` I haven't seen her yet , but I hear she's a _RARE_ '' ! STO
* I wasn't surprised . STO
* The ward was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female _RARE_ . STO
* We didn't get many at _RARE_ and they were never pretty sights . STO
* It was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular _RARE_ ward . STO
* The moment I walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed . STO
* They'd cleaned her up some , of course , and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk . STO
* But there was something about her -- and I felt my lips forming a name . STO
* Alice But this woman's name was Rose _RARE_ ! STO
* I looked at the chart for _RARE_ . STO
* Yes , Rose _RARE_ , diagnosis : _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* She looked about sixty , though I recalled that the chart gave her age as _RARE_ . STO
* An ugly scar _RARE_ the somewhat familiar _RARE_ face , already _RARE_ by the _RARE_ network of broken red veins that heavy _RARE_ carry . STO
* Her _RARE_ hair was _RARE_ -- bleached blonde and its real , dirty gray . STO
* Oh , could it be ? STO
* No , no it was an unfortunate _RARE_ , that was all it was , and I turned to _RARE_ , forcing myself to put my _RARE_ out of my mind . STO
* In a low voice , _RARE_ filled us in she'd been picked up downtown , passed out in the doorway . STO
* Although quiet when they brought her in , she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out . STO
* It was the old story . STO
* We'd keep her a day or two , and the _RARE_ people would talk to her . STO
* But if she wasn't interested , she'd just go back to the same life she'd left . STO
* Turning toward the patient again , I -- I can't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I felt sick . STO
* I tell you , it took every _RARE_ of control I had to be able to speak . STO
* `` Now , Miss -- or is it Mrs. _RARE_ '' ? STO
* I never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it _RARE_ them , I've always thought , to _RARE_ first . STO
* This was one time I'd have _RARE_ broken my own rule , but habit was too strong . STO
* `` Hey '' ! STO
* Her voice was flat and dull . STO
* But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away . STO
* It was then that I saw what the _RARE_ covers revealed . STO
* There were _RARE_ on the sheet . STO
* `` What's this '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` Your period '' ? STO
* She shook her head . STO
* `` I been _RARE_ a little now and then '' , she said quietly , no emotion in her voice . STO
* `` Have you spoken to a doctor about it '' ? STO
* Once again , there was a negative shake . STO
* I told Miss _RARE_ to move her down the hall where we had an _RARE_ table . STO
* `` Better do a _RARE_ '' , I told Pete . STO
* It was only a few moments before Miss _RARE_ had her in the proper position for a _RARE_ , but I couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination . STO
* Pete stood by with a slide and took the _RARE_ , sent it down to the _RARE_ with a request for the test . STO
* That done , I told Miss _RARE_ to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind . STO
* I was busy the rest of the day . STO
* _RARE_ in the afternoon , I was up on Seven again . STO
* One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled . STO
* On my way to the elevator , I ran into Pete . STO
* `` I've got the results on the _RARE_ _RARE_ test '' , he said . STO
* `` There's something there , all right . STO
* Class Three , they said . STO
* Do you want to talk to her , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Well '' -- I didn't -- I didn't ever want to see that woman again . STO
* But that was ridiculous , of course . STO
* `` All right . STO
* We'll do a D. and C. and get her permission for a _RARE_ . STO
* Maybe it's nothing , maybe it's _RARE_ or in _RARE_ -- can't take any chances '' . STO
* `` If you can keep her here that long '' , Pete said _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ tells me she's started _RARE_ already , wants to get out . STO
* _RARE_ to get to her _RARE_ , I guess '' . STO
* I _RARE_ in distaste . STO
* `` Well , better see what I can do '' . STO
* We'd been standing right outside Miss _RARE_ door and as I went to turn the _RARE_ to enter , I was surprised to find that the door was slightly _RARE_ . STO
* But she seemed to be _RARE_ and in any case , we'd been talking in low tones . STO
* Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , I felt an inward _RARE_ . STO
* `` I sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said . STO
* `` I just got through seeing one of you guys . STO
* What do you want '' ? STO
* There was something almost _RARE_ in her tone , but I _RARE_ it . STO
* `` I've just been talking to Dr. _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* `` We'd like you to have a _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* That's quite minor , nothing to worry about . STO
* But we would like your permission to do -- that is , to go further if it proves necessary '' . STO
* `` No '' . STO
* It was flat , definite . STO
* `` Suppose you let me explain . STO
* Actually , I rather doubt that we'll have to do this . STO
* Even if we do , you'll be out of here in a week , probably '' . STO
* I was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here , where she couldn't get to the liquor . STO
* `` No '' . STO
* I looked at her in amazement . STO
* I'd had patients who'd refused _RARE_ before , of course , but never one who didn't show , in one way or another , the reason why . STO
* _RARE_ , it was fear , but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her hands were still on the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Will you tell me why '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* She smiled , a smile without humor . STO
* `` You shouldn't tell your little _RARE_ outside of the patient's door '' , she said . STO
* `` I've got _RARE_ , haven't I '' ? STO
* She went on , _RARE_ my _RARE_ . STO
* `` I'm not going to be one of your _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Let your pupils learn on someone else , _RARE_ . STO
* Just let me die in peace '' . STO
* I stared at her , almost _RARE_ . STO
* Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was . STO
* Even her voice had taken on a more _RARE_ tone . STO
* This was someone who'd come down in the world , I thought . STO
* A long , long way down . STO
* Again there was something familiar about her , something -- `` You haven't got _RARE_ '' , I said as strongly as I could . STO
* `` I don't know what you heard that would make you think so , but I assure you I don't even know myself , so how can you be so sure ? STO
* And even if '' -- `` Don't give me a lot of talk , Joe '' . STO
* I _RARE_ at her . STO
* She could have found out my first name , of course -- that wouldn't be difficult . STO
* But there was that something , some echo in the way she spoke . STO
* She was watching me _RARE_ , a funny little _RARE_ on her lips . STO
* `` _RARE_ , baby ? STO
* _RARE_ I've changed , haven't I ? STO
* But you haven't changed much , Joe '' . STO
* I knew then , knew with a _RARE_ shock . STO
* `` Alice '' -- I _RARE_ through dry lips . STO
* `` Alice , for goodness sake '' -- `` Alice '' , she echoed _RARE_ . STO
* `` What's the matter , Joe , you scared of me ? STO
* _RARE_ I'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife ? STO
* Well , don't worry . STO
* Just let me _RARE_ here '' -- `` But why did you come back '' ? STO
* I'd found my voice . STO
* `` Where have you been all these years '' ? STO
* She shrugged . STO
* `` Here and there . STO
* As for coming back here -- well , I'll tell you the truth , I didn't even know where I was when I came to . STO
* The last thing I remember is a bar in San Diego '' -- The way she spoke , her flat acceptance of her _RARE_ _RARE_ , made me _RARE_ . STO
* And this was _RARE_ mother ! STO
* `` I never asked you for any favors , Joe '' , she went on , `` but I'm asking one now . STO
* Let me _RARE_ here ! STO
* You doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good ? STO
* No , I want out , Joe '' ! STO
* I looked at the _RARE_ wreck of a woman before me . STO
* Let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn't it ? STO
* What she'd said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from me . STO
* If I let her go , she'd disappear once more . STO
* And Gladdy would be safe ! STO
* I was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea . STO
* She made me welcome . STO
* Her dark cool _RARE_ were _RARE_ than any woman's ; ; the many little _RARE_ she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air I breathed into a nitrogen _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , she _RARE_ me , and drew me deeper into her . STO
* I no longer knew how deep I was , somewhere under _RARE_ feet , getting _RARE_ , _RARE_ and more _RARE_ by the second . STO
* The reasons for this dive seemed foolish now . STO
* Only the dive itself had any meaning . STO
* The _RARE_ nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the mouthpiece and _RARE_ in the sweet water . STO
* Perhaps if I took off the _RARE_ I could _RARE_ better , love my woman better . STO
* I chuckled aloud , and the mouthpiece fell out . STO
* While a _RARE_ part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part _RARE_ over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time . STO
* It was when I packed up what _RARE_ I had and went to Paris . STO
* It was no vacation , just me getting out after a _RARE_ . STO
* I knew it wouldn't be the same . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ never are , but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind . STO
* Once before I had been to Paris , long before I married _RARE_ . STO
* That first time was good and it stuck with me . STO
* I was _RARE_ back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at _RARE_ instead of _RARE_ . STO
* It was a Saturday evening in April with a _RARE_ rain , and I was a little high on the good taste of life . STO
* I had a _RARE_ of money , which was unusual when I was in the army , and the plane would be _RARE_ all night . STO
* In less than an hour I had gotten a hotel , _RARE_ , shaved and was out on the _RARE_ _RARE_ in a fresh uniform . STO
* I felt like a _RARE_ in Rome . STO
* All the women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ; everything was _RARE_ to my _RARE_ eyes . STO
* There were some sweet machines other than women : an old _RARE_ , a lean _RARE_ _RARE_ on an American _RARE_ , a _RARE_ , a type _RARE_ _RARE_ and lots more . STO
* There was the _RARE_ de _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ -- I was no _RARE_ , but I was young , and this was Paris ! STO
* I had champagne at _RARE_ , then went into a cafe called the _RARE_ et _RARE_ to ask the way to _RARE_ . STO
* I never got there . STO
* I met Claire , which was better . STO
* She was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine . STO
* I stared . STO
* I didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful . STO
* She was blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress . STO
* Maybe her _RARE_ eating wasn't _RARE_ because she was so positive about it . STO
* When she had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill , she came directly to my table and said : `` _RARE_ soldier , I have _RARE_ one hunger with food . STO
* I feel another of terrible _RARE_ . STO
* Is your evening free '' ? STO
* `` Madame '' , I said with _RARE_ _RARE_ because of the `` handsome '' -- `` yeah '' . STO
* And so off we went to her apartment . STO
* She was a _RARE_ , of course , the poor girl . STO
* _RARE_ the break of day I _RARE_ philosophical , and drew _RARE_ about her way of eating bread and cheese . STO
* Now it was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when I returned . STO
* I got there on a Saturday evening . STO
* I made the mistake of going to the _RARE_ et _RARE_ . STO
* The place was busy but I didn't feel like a _RARE_ . STO
* I sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up . STO
* I had part of a bottle of French beer called _RARE_ _RARE_ ( so help me ) , then switched to _RARE_ . STO
* After a few hours , Life hadn't showed , and I was _RARE_ . STO
* I went to my hotel and slept . STO
* The next morning a little _RARE_ made me feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning ? STO
* So I drank more _RARE_ . STO
* All that day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space . STO
* I read the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , but sex . STO
* That's what was on my mind . STO
* I was turning over the idea of a good _RARE_ when I _RARE_ off . STO
* I felt better Tuesday evening when I woke up . STO
* My head was clear , my thinking sober and I was _RARE_ to this Paris idea as a _RARE_ on top of all my others . STO
* A good _RARE_ has that kind of therapeutic value . STO
* _RARE_ earlier the weather had turned cold and it was _RARE_ . STO
* I went out into it . STO
* I walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a park , and I sat down on a _RARE_ bench where the light was dim and came from the sky . STO
* There was dignity and beauty in the little white _RARE_ falling through the blue night . STO
* I had on only a _RARE_ , but I wasn't cold . STO
* I was just miserable . STO
* Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded _RARE_ as a walking stick . STO
* She saw me and sat down beside me , three feet away . STO
* Suddenly I understood why she had the _RARE_ . STO
* It gave her _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* Without it she would have been _RARE_ and limp . STO
* It gave her _RARE_ . STO
* It gave her the right to sit down beside me , back straight , one hand out on the handle . STO
* I couldn't imagine her without it . STO
* I knew all about her . STO
* She was another human being and happened to be a _RARE_ . STO
* I didn't much care if she were there or not . STO
* After a while she said with sort of an _RARE_ laugh , `` You have snow in your hair and ears '' . STO
* ( I didn't have on a hat . STO
* ) _RARE_ glancing at her , I smiled a bleak one which said , Thanks , baby , but I'd rather be alone . STO
* She was silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy '' ? STO
* `` I'm not unhappy '' , I _RARE_ , staring at the snow . STO
* She was trying to make a hole in my _RARE_ , and I didn't want it . STO
* `` Is it a woman '' ? STO
* She asked gently . STO
* She must have seen the ring on my left hand . STO
* `` Well -- women and unhappiness go together '' , I observed _RARE_ , adding , `` You can _RARE_ your _RARE_ on that '' . STO
* `` Ah , Monsieur , it is not my business to _RARE_ it . STO
* '' This took me so funny I had to look at her . STO
* I felt my frozen sad face _RARE_ , and I grinned a silly one I couldn't have helped . STO
* I even _RARE_ a _RARE_ . STO
* She smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile . STO
* She was even more miserable than me . STO
* Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was _RARE_ and infinite wisdom in them . STO
* `` Now isn't it better to smile '' ? STO
* She asked . STO
* Because I liked this sad person so much , I said , `` Will you have a drink with me '' ? STO
* I could see the ancient _RARE_ _RARE_ itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same _RARE_ . STO
* Anyway , I pulled a bottle of _RARE_ Martin out of my _RARE_ , drew the _RARE_ , and passed it to her . STO
* I could see she was shocked . STO
* `` I'm sorry I haven't got a glass '' , I said . STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' , she said , taking the bottle , `` not for that be sorry '' . STO
* She tilted up and drank , and then I drank . STO
* It's really _RARE_ to drink good _RARE_ like that , but I hadn't cared before . STO
* I wasn't going to _RARE_ around a glass . STO
* There wasn't much light in the blue dark , but I could see her well . STO
* No child , this _RARE_ , she must have been _RARE_ or even forty . STO
* I couldn't be sure . STO
* Somehow she was attractive . STO
* Not good looking , but _RARE_ and wise so that it made her attractive . STO
* I liked her , and all at once I was glad she was there . STO
* We finished the bottle -- I hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober . STO
* I suppose we were cold , but we didn't feel it . STO
* We seemed to be _RARE_ , sadly , _RARE_ , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell . STO
* Then she said , `` _RARE_ '' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word . STO
* I sensed no stranger in her . STO
* We _RARE_ and made love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known with _RARE_ . STO
* I decided _RARE_ was the best estimate of her age . STO
* She had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side . STO
* I think we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the _RARE_ had _RARE_ . STO
* I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night's _RARE_ . STO
* My head was clear . STO
* I was hungry as a _RARE_ , and my body felt lean and vital . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , I said _RARE_ , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips . STO
* She looked good , with her short _RARE_ hair and no _RARE_ . STO
* Maybe closer to thirty , I thought . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* She exclaimed , smiling . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* `` Yeah , but breakfast first '' . STO
* With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom . STO
* I called downstairs for food and a _RARE_ for her . STO
* She came out pink from a hot bath , and I gave her my _RARE_ . STO
* I had brushed my teeth , _RARE_ , shaved and dressed by the time a _RARE_ _RARE_ in breakfast . STO
* `` The _RARE_ Monsieur '' , he said , _RARE_ it . STO
* I gave it to the woman . STO
* `` What is this for '' ? STO
* She asked _RARE_ . STO
* `` Why , to brush your teeth '' . STO
* `` But I already have ! STO
* I used yours '' . STO
* `` Oh '' ? STO
* I said with round eyes . STO
* I wondered if I ought to go use the new one myself . STO
* But I smelled the coffee , and thinking , What the hell , live _RARE_ , I decided I would _RARE_ my worries away . STO
* The coffee wasn't very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good . STO
* We sent the _RARE_ away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham , hot _RARE_ eggs and hot _RARE_ bread . STO
* As we ate , we talked . STO
* Her name was _RARE_ , and mine Stephen . STO
* We sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee . STO
* `` You are very _RARE_ , do you know , Stephen '' , she remarked . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* I grunted , _RARE_ . STO
* `` Yes , because you didn't run off to use that new _RARE_ '' . STO
* I raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror . STO
* `` I didn't really use yours '' , she went on . STO
* `` I carry one in my purse . STO
* I know men never kiss _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* To my immense relief , she changed the subject in the next sentence : `` Shall we go to the _RARE_ today '' ? STO
* `` All right '' . STO
* I said with enthusiasm at the idea . STO
* `` But not immediately '' . STO
* I put aside my empty cup . STO
* She smiled all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own . STO
* We were not rushed . STO
* `` What is this from '' ? STO
* I asked , touching the scar on her stomach . STO
* It was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle . STO
* `` A bullet '' , she answered . STO
* The _RARE_ was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and I wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all . STO
* She understood sex anyway , and played at it well . STO
* We went to the _RARE_ for a few hours , then by _RARE_ to a _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* It was a nice place , not filled with smoke . STO
* We had champagne and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ brought the wine first , a _RARE_ instead of the bottle I had ordered . STO
* He must have thought I was a tourist . STO
* I fixed him with a _RARE_ eye and said , `` What's this for ? STO
* I didn't ask for a _RARE_ of champagne '' . STO
* I thought that was pretty _RARE_ , but I didn't laugh . STO
* Two letters had arrived for Miss Theresa _RARE_ : she put them in her bag . STO
* She would not stop to read them in American _RARE_ , as many were doing , sitting on _RARE_ or leaning against the walls , but pushed her way out into the street . STO
* This was her first day in Rome and it was June . STO
* An enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead . STO
* In her _RARE_ eye -- her imagination _RARE_ fully , almost _RARE_ , to these _RARE_ peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , _RARE_ on its great bare _RARE_ that the _RARE_ marked , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , here a _RARE_ , there a pine , and all around the low blue hills . STO
* _RARE_ in old Latin books returned to her : the _RARE_ _RARE_ Today , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* She would see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight . STO
* Moreover , nursing various _RARE_ -- her _RARE_ , then her mother , then her father -- through their lengthy _RARE_ ( everybody could tell you the _RARE_ were always sick ) , Theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot . STO
* England , France , Germany , _RARE_ , and Italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of pills and _RARE_ , she had conceived a _RARE_ passion by _RARE_ , to see all these places with her own eyes . STO
* The very night after her father's funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : Now I can go . STO
* There's nothing to stop me now . STO
* So here it was , here was Italy , anyway , and terribly _RARE_ . STO
* In the street the traffic was really _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ all went _RARE_ at once down the narrow length of it or _RARE_ _RARE_ around a fountain . STO
* _RARE_ of tourists went by her in national groups -- English school girls in blue uniforms , German boys with _RARE_ attached , _RARE_ dressed Americans looking in shop windows . STO
* _RARE_ to be alone , Theresa climbed the _RARE_ _RARE_ staircase that opened to her left . STO
* The Spanish _RARE_ . STO
* Something special was going on here just now -- the annual display of _RARE_ plants . STO
* She had heard about it the night before at her hotel . STO
* It was not yet complete : _RARE_ were _RARE_ the _RARE_ plants from a truck and placing them in _RARE_ rows on the steps above . STO
* The _RARE_ were as large as _RARE_ , and their _RARE_ _RARE_ , many still tight in the _RARE_ , ranged in color from _RARE_ through _RARE_ and rose to the _RARE_ pink , along with many white ones too . STO
* _RARE_ , thought Theresa , climbing in her _RARE_ , _RARE_ way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything . STO
* In Rome , all over Europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed . STO
* _RARE_ up the staircase she stopped and sat down . STO
* Other people were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide _RARE_ and leaning over the _RARE_ above , watching the _RARE_ mass , or just enjoying the sun . STO
* Theresa sat with her letters in her lap , breathing _RARE_ air . STO
* The sun warmed her , as it seemed to be warming everything , perhaps even the _RARE_ of _RARE_ or the chill _RARE_ of churches . STO
* She _RARE_ her _RARE_ jacket and smoked a cigarette . STO
* _RARE_ excited ; ; how could you be both at once ? STO
* Strange , but she was . STO
* Presently , she picked up the first of the letters . STO
* A few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had _RARE_ with anxiety and _RARE_ . STO
* Of course , one of them would have to go and do this ! STO
* Poor Cousin Elec , she thought , tears rising to _RARE_ in the sun , but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer ? STO
* And how on earth did I ever get this letter anyway ? STO
* She had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her . STO
* Her Cousin Emma _RARE_ had written it , in her loose high old _RARE_ _RARE_ -- _RARE_ carefully crossed , but _RARE_ inclined to _RARE_ like an old car on the downward slope . STO
* Cousin Emma had simply put Miss Theresa _RARE_ , Rome , Italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in Tuxapoka , Alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* No return address whatsoever . STO
* Somebody had scrawled American _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* , across the envelope , and now Theresa had it , all as easily as if she had been the President of the Republic or the Pope . STO
* Inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness , death , and burial of Cousin Alexander _RARE_ . STO
* Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- _RARE_ , devoted , _RARE_ -- had lived next door to the _RARE_ in Tuxapoka from time _RARE_ until the _RARE_ had moved to _RARE_ fifteen years ago . STO
* Two days before he was taken sick , Cousin Elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his _RARE_ , and Cousin Elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a _RARE_ paper knife which Theresa had _RARE_ as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died . STO
* I'm supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh . STO
* This letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it . STO
* She _RARE_ the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and turned with relief to one from her brother George . STO
* But _RARE_ George , when he had written , had only just returned from going to Tuxapoka to Cousin _RARE_ funeral . STO
* He was full of heavy family _RARE_ . STO
* All the fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today . STO
* His own children had suffered from the _RARE_ of those values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his _RARE_ ( he had one so far , still in _RARE_ ) , he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all . STO
* A life of _RARE_ and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand . STO
* Poor George ! STO
* The only boy , the family darling . STO
* _RARE_ with her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong . STO
* Theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right _RARE_ , and though _RARE_ by various girls and various _RARE_ of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George . STO
* Could it just be , Theresa wondered , that Anne had understood only too well , and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull ? STO
* As for Cousin Alexander _RARE_ , the only thing Theresa could remember at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had _RARE_ long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole _RARE_ family had been aroused to go next door at Cousin _RARE_ call -- first Papa , then Mother , then Theresa and George . STO
* There they all did their _RARE_ to help Cousin Elec get a _RARE_ out of his foot . STO
* He had _RARE_ downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his _RARE_ , on a _RARE_ . STO
* He held his long _RARE_ foot in both hands , and this and his _RARE_ face -- he was trying _RARE_ not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey . STO
* They all surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a _RARE_ of hot water which she poured _RARE_ into a white _RARE_ pan . STO
* `` Can you think of anything to do '' ? STO
* She kept repeating . STO
* `` I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to ! STO
* Can you think of anything to do '' ? STO
* `` You might treat it like the _RARE_ '' , said Papa . STO
* `` _RARE_ a cold key down his back '' . STO
* `` I just hope this happens to you someday '' , said Cousin Elec , who was not at his best . STO
* `` Poor Cousin Elec '' , George said . STO
* He was younger than Theresa : she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not _RARE_ . STO
* `` Poor Cousin Elec '' . STO
* Now , here they both were , still the same , George full of _RARE_ _RARE_ , and Cousin Emma in despair . STO
* Theresa shifted to a new page . STO
* `` Of course ( _RARE_ letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered . STO
* Cousin Emma is alone in that big old house and won't hear to _RARE_ from it . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them , and Anne and I have told her she's more than welcome here , but I think she feels that she might be an _RARE_ , especially as long as our _RARE_ is still in high school . STO
* The other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that Tuxapoka is _RARE_ with -- Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ , for example . STO
* But there is more in this than meets the eye . STO
* A new bathroom would certainly have to be put in . STO
* The wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally _RARE_ off . STO
* '' ( Theresa skipped a page of details about the house . STO
* ) `` I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them . STO
* I may settle on some _RARE_ arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best . STO
* '' I really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes me sick . STO
* I'll start _RARE_ in a minute , sitting on these cold steps . STO
* She got up , standing _RARE_ for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men . STO
* They wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked _RARE_ black and slick . STO
* Yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so . STO
* Just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap _RARE_ , Parker fountain _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` No '' , said Theresa . STO
* `` No , no '' ! STO
* She said . STO
* The man did not wish to leave . STO
* He knew how to spread himself against the _RARE_ of the space that had to separate them . STO
* _RARE_ rides in the park , the _RARE_ by moonlight , he specialized . STO
* Theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two . STO
* There she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of _RARE_ , while the _RARE_ picked himself another _RARE_ American lady , carrying a camera and a handsome _RARE_ bag , _RARE_ the steps alone . STO
* Was he ever successful , Theresa wondered . STO
* The lady with the _RARE_ bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ; at last , alarm . STO
* She cast about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn't be allowed ! STO
* Finally , she _RARE_ away up the steps . STO
* Theresa _RARE_ , still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to Europe was viewed in family circles as an _RARE_ between Cousin _RARE_ death and `` doing something '' about Cousin Emma . STO
* They were even , Anne and George , probably thinking themselves very _RARE_ in not _RARE_ that she really should cut out `` one or two countries '' and come home in August to get Cousin _RARE_ house ready before the teachers came to Tuxapoka in September . STO
* Of course , it wasn't Anne and _RARE_ fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and weren't they always _RARE_ that they really didn't know what they would do without Theresa ? STO
* The trouble is , Theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter _RARE_ , nothing here is supposed even to exist . STO
* They would not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow . STO
* It never registered with them that I had time to read all of _RARE_ , Dickens , and _RARE_ while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after _RARE_ operation . STO
* It would have been exactly the same to them if I had read through all _RARE_ volumes of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* She arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other . STO
* Then , with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ? STO
* She became aware that two Italian _RARE_ , carrying a large _RARE_ pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* '' `` Oh put it there '' ! STO
* She indicated a spot a little distance away . STO
* I knew it as surely as everybody in _RARE_ -- that Lucille was a husband _RARE_ . STO
* You can't keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only _RARE_ . STO
* And I've been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its Lucille Warren . STO
* Just as it has its Susan _RARE_ , though _RARE_ ever bothered to tell me that . STO
* Susan _RARE_ , that's me . STO
* They even talked about Lucille down at the Young _RARE_ League where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission . STO
* I never heard my folks talk about her , though . STO
* They were _RARE_ religious people , and I can _RARE_ say I never heard them spread any gossip about anybody . STO
* Even if they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren , I know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me . STO
* My folks and my faith protected me from things like that . STO
* And so I was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. Warren . STO
* I asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck . STO
* I asked him if it was true . STO
* He gave me a straight , honest answer . STO
* `` Look , _RARE_ baby '' , he'd said . STO
* Much as I love you -- well , a _RARE_ a guy and _RARE_ willing to -- to come across . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ , that's all it is -- I don't even like Lucille much '' . STO
* I guess it was at that moment that I realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren . STO
* But it didn't seem fair . STO
* My love for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could I possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn't hesitate to use her sex . STO
* Johnnie was a _RARE_ with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the _RARE_ line . STO
* It was a vivid , sharp February morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard , bringing some stuff Dad had ordered . STO
* I wasn't in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men , but the moment I saw Johnnie , I knew he was different . STO
* He wasn't only different -- he was it . STO
* He had an easy _RARE_ grace about him , the kind that kids don't have , but that I had sometimes admired in other older men . STO
* His smile was quick , and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp . STO
* The most _RARE_ thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too . STO
* I could hardly believe such good luck was mine . STO
* And now Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him . STO
* I guess she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on Johnnie , my Johnnie . STO
* I didn't like it one bit . STO
* But what could I do ? STO
* A man had to have his release -- at least that's what the boys used to say in high school -- and I wasn't providing it for Johnnie . STO
* Neither was his wife . STO
* She wouldn't have , even if he'd asked her . STO
* But he wouldn't ask her -- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will . STO
* And he wouldn't leave her either -- he'd told me that . STO
* He was too _RARE_ to leave his wife _RARE_ and leave those helpless children without their _RARE_ . STO
* Johnnie loved me and wanted me . STO
* But the only love I was giving him was the pure kind . STO
* It was weeks before we even kissed for the first time . STO
* _RARE_ my _RARE_ wishes , we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck . STO
* The rides were _RARE_ enough -- mostly we talked . STO
* But by the time the first _RARE_ of spring came around , we both knew we were _RARE_ in love . STO
* Yet even then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little . STO
* `` It's so crazy '' , I told him once . STO
* `` I always imagined I would probably end up _RARE_ a minister or somebody like that . STO
* Somebody with no _RARE_ . STO
* You know '' . STO
* `` And you fall for a lumber _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Who drinks far too much '' . STO
* `` And _RARE_ too much '' . STO
* `` And '' , I was _RARE_ off the items on my fingers , `` _RARE_ too much and goes out with the boys , _RARE_ they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the fold '' . STO
* He examined his nails carefully . STO
* `` I could walk out the door '' . STO
* `` Don't you dare '' . STO
* `` And never show my face or my truck around here again '' . STO
* He still wasn't looking at me . STO
* `` You wouldn't '' . STO
* `` Or I could visit Lucille Warren '' . STO
* `` You wouldn't . STO
* Please ! STO
* You wouldn't '' . STO
* He shrugged _RARE_ . STO
* `` I might '' . STO
* And now he was seeing her . STO
* He'd just admitted it to me . STO
* I huddled _RARE_ beside him in the truck . STO
* It was all my doing -- his seeing her . STO
* Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to keep it . STO
* At first , Johnnie hadn't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me ? STO
* But then he had said , `` All right , kid , if that's how you want it , that's how it'll be '' . STO
* But what had I done , trying to keep us pure ? STO
* I had driven him into the arms of that _RARE_ woman . STO
* I had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the _RARE_ ! STO
* So one week later , I _RARE_ to him in the little motel on _RARE_ 10 . STO
* My very first time . STO
* I was desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the _RARE_ of Lucille Warren . STO
* And , though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever _RARE_ . STO
* I wanted him , with a terrifying _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ enough , it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me . STO
* `` Love me , Johnnie '' . STO
* `` I will , _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Outside , in the _RARE_ fields behind the motel , a thousand _RARE_ _RARE_ us . STO
* `` Will you always love me this way '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Always '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* And I _RARE_ closer to the man I loved . STO
* It was as _RARE_ and _RARE_ a night as any bride ever experienced . STO
* I had had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no _RARE_ of marriage , but I had all the joy that goes with them . STO
* `` Johnnie ? STO
* `` It can't be wrong , can it ? STO
* Not really '' . STO
* Johnnie rose on one elbow . STO
* `` Stop worrying . STO
* It's never wrong if love is real '' . STO
* I took great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness . STO
* _RARE_ peace , complete _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ delight , I later discovered . STO
* I felt no conflict between what I was doing and my strict religious _RARE_ . STO
* I had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids , and many times I had thought about my love for Johnnie who , being thirty , brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about . STO
* I had also thought a lot about how God must look on true love , and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God , my promise to remain pure until I was married . STO
* I was practically a bride , after all . STO
* There would have been a ceremony if it had been possible . STO
* Of this , I had no doubt . STO
* _RARE_ Johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness ? STO
* Of course he would . STO
* He'd not only told me so , he'd proved it . STO
* It wasn't _RARE_ fault that he was _RARE_ tied down to that _RARE_ woman who did her best to make his life unbearable . STO
* Just because he was _RARE_ enough to want to continue supporting his two children , as any decent man would , that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too . STO
* And if I could contribute to that , I'd do it . STO
* The cost didn't matter . STO
* No price is too high when true love is at stake . STO
* And I had no _RARE_ about how true this love was . STO
* I'd never even _RARE_ with a boy , and after I met Johnnie he never touched me for the _RARE_ while , not until I all but threw myself at him . STO
* He was plenty _RARE_ , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and I figured that , emotionally , I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half . STO
* What could a mere twelve years matter ? STO
* It wasn't , I was sure , a difference in age that came between people , but a difference in maturity . STO
* And hadn't I _RARE_ him from Lucille Warren ? STO
* She'd have gotten him , if I hadn't stopped her . STO
* After all , Lucille Warren was a _RARE_ from way back . STO
* But I'd been a good girl and now God was _RARE_ me with the gift of this magnificent man and the _RARE_ love we shared . STO
* It was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring . STO
* `` Love me '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* Love you '' . STO
* `` Always and always , Johnnie '' ? STO
* `` Always '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ time in Boston . STO
* A chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow . STO
* From the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming , members of the Young _RARE_ League , and I'd been chosen to represent our chapter . STO
* I had mixed emotions about going . STO
* I'd been seeing Johnnie almost a year now , but I still didn't want to leave him for five whole days . STO
* But I had looked forward so much to being with this church group . STO
* I hadn't been doing as much work as I used to in _RARE_ and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever . STO
* I wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group . STO
* So I went to Boston . STO
* The first meeting was held in _RARE_ Hall , a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states . STO
* My cousin Alma , at whose home I was staying during the _RARE_ , introduced me to a group of young people from Rhode Island . STO
* One of them was a very friendly , lovely fellow named _RARE_ , a boy about my age with slick , blond hair and dancing blue eyes . STO
* He looked very different from Johnnie -- in fact , he looked sort of like me . STO
* I thought so , and he mentioned it , and Alma said so too . STO
* After the meeting , there was going to be a party at _RARE_ house . STO
* I assumed Alma would get me there , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated . STO
* Outside the hall , I anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my elbow . STO
* `` Hey , there , beautiful _RARE_ of mine '' , _RARE_ said . STO
* `` _RARE_ a _RARE_ to get to the party '' ? STO
* I couldn't help laughing with him . STO
* `` Well , I should find Alma '' -- I began . STO
* `` Alma , _RARE_ . STO
* Come along with me '' . STO
* I went . STO
* By the time we arrived , the party was already going strong . STO
* A couple of the girls were laughing rather _RARE_ and I realized they were drinking . STO
* My folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with Johnnie . STO
* I hadn't liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning . STO
* But when Johnnie _RARE_ the taste with _RARE_ _RARE_ , I enjoyed it . STO
* Of course I enjoyed _RARE_ anything if I did it with Johnnie . STO
* Johnnie I suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening . STO
* But that was only natural , I decided ; ; surely he was still resting _RARE_ in my heart . STO
* `` I don't see Alma anywhere '' , I said . STO
* `` She's invisible tonight . STO
* _RARE_ , let's find out where they're keeping the glasses '' . STO
* I drew back . STO
* `` I -- I don't think so , _RARE_ . STO
* Not for me '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ , come on '' . STO
* `` No -- really '' . STO
* He shrugged . STO
* `` Okay . STO
* But at least come along while I get _RARE_ '' . STO
* The kitchen was _RARE_ . STO
* Strange faces , most of them , and I wasn't even sure all of them had come from the League meeting . STO
* Under normal circumstances , he had a certain _RARE_ _RARE_ charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs . STO
* Today , he looked like an _RARE_ who had left his _RARE_ pills on the bureau and spent six months in space : hollow eyes , hollow cheeks , hollow stomach . STO
* _RARE_ , he thought . STO
* A shot of orange juice would make everything seem better . STO
* He looked around his little _RARE_ : bureau , bed , table , chair , _RARE_ stove . STO
* Then he remembered . STO
* `` You share a refrigerator '' , Mrs. Kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from New York in _RARE_ rain , that had sounded reasonable . STO
* In the cold light of day , it seemed a _RARE_ arrangement . STO
* _RARE_ bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? STO
* She had explained it -- something about summer _RARE_ eating out and not enough space in the units . STO
* And where was the thing ? STO
* He remembered seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Ah , yes -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside , on the `` _RARE_ veranda '' between Unit _RARE_ Three and Unit _RARE_ Four . STO
* It was still _RARE_ , and Mrs. _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ through the gray haze like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and _RARE_ . STO
* Charlie _RARE_ his orange juice and one of the long , skinny green pills , his spirits as damp as the day . STO
* This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it . STO
* `` Take a full month '' , the doctor had said . STO
* `` _RARE_ of sun , lots of rest . STO
* The red pills are a _RARE_ compound . STO
* This is a sleeping _RARE_ . STO
* The others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked . STO
* You young men get to be my age , you won't take _RARE_ so lightly '' . STO
* Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment . STO
* The doctor could call it anything from _RARE_ to _RARE_ ; ; but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it . STO
* He had loved and lost Vivian _RARE_ to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride _RARE_ forever , which was really _RARE_ it on . STO
* He had caught , too , like an _RARE_ , a confirmed _RARE_ of women . STO
* Once burned -- _RARE_ , really , because Vivian had given him every _RARE_ -- forever shy . STO
* From now on , his was going to be a man's world : the North _RARE_ , duck _RARE_ at _RARE_ , beer and _RARE_ and male _RARE_ . STO
* Meanwhile , he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make sandy _RARE_ at his feet , the doctor's _RARE_ for lots of sun seemed like a hollow _RARE_ . STO
* In these damp circumstances , he was an _RARE_ bet to develop _RARE_ . STO
* He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby , _RARE_ in a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , bearing down on him . STO
* `` _RARE_ blow '' ! STO
* She bellowed triumphantly . STO
* He had noticed before that the _RARE_ seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of _RARE_ victory over the tourists . STO
* `` Fine , day after tomorrow '' , she added . STO
* `` I hope so '' , he said . STO
* `` I've got this cold . STO
* _RARE_ I'd _RARE_ it out in the sun '' . STO
* `` Ah '' . STO
* She studied him briefly . STO
* `` You've got a peaked look . STO
* Better get in out of the wet '' . STO
* Charlie _RARE_ to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , _RARE_ being less than _RARE_ . STO
* As for its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with Vivian lost to him forever . STO
* He could imagine her at this minute , _RARE_ in _RARE_ with _RARE_ , _RARE_ on golden sands , looking forward to a life of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* All Charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon , a salami sandwich for lunch , and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long . STO
* He _RARE_ through the light reading provided by Mrs. Kirby for her guests : four separate adventures of the _RARE_ _RARE_ ( At the _RARE_ , At the _RARE_ , On the _RARE_ , and In _RARE_ ) and several agricultural _RARE_ on the treatment of _RARE_ disease in cattle , _RARE_ illustrated . STO
* He _RARE_ , only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , _RARE_ his other _RARE_ . STO
* He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and _RARE_ . STO
* His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her _RARE_ for color , had _RARE_ a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing proved to be a sweater , of the _RARE_ variety that _RARE_ onto men's _RARE_ -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size _RARE_ . STO
* He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda _RARE_ , and put the whole thing out of his mind . STO
* Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator . STO
* `` Would you mind _RARE_ your _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Said this note . STO
* `` The smell _RARE_ everything '' ! STO
* Everything being the sweater , a _RARE_ case , and a _RARE_ bottle of _RARE_ _RARE_ pink hand lotion . STO
* The note paper was pink , too , and the _RARE_ small and _RARE_ and utterly _RARE_ . STO
* Not that he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach _RARE_ . STO
* He scrawled `` _RARE_ '' across the bottom of the note and then , against his better judgment , added : `` Don't you eat '' ? STO
* He didn't want to encourage anything here ; ; but on the other hand , he didn't want her _RARE_ his salami . STO
* `` Not _RARE_ '' , came the answer the following day . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ have really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater _RARE_ . STO
* But then , as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense . STO
* Take Vivian . STO
* Yes , take Vivian . STO
* Somebody had . STO
* Now , if this were Vivian next door to him and if , for some obscure female reason , she kept her clothes in the refrigerator , they would not be pink . STO
* They would be black or white or _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , like Vivian herself . STO
* _RARE_ , Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and _RARE_ girls who wore pink were _RARE_ _RARE_ to their _RARE_ . STO
* `` Why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator '' ? STO
* He _RARE_ aloud . STO
* _RARE_ '' ? STO
* It was Mrs. Kirby , making her _RARE_ way along the veranda , laden with a _RARE_ collection of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* `` What's that you say '' ? STO
* `` Oh , nothing . STO
* Just glad the _RARE_ stopped '' . STO
* `` Oh , yes . STO
* Just look at that sky . STO
* Be a _RARE_ by afternoon '' . STO
* `` I hope so . STO
* I've got this cold '' . STO
* `` So you said '' . STO
* She _RARE_ him . STO
* `` My , you're peaked . STO
* You want to watch out that you don't get burned to an _RARE_ , first _RARE_ day . STO
* I must remember to _RARE_ the girl next to you in _RARE_ . STO
* That pale _RARE_ the worst '' . STO
* That pale kind , Charlie thought . STO
* _RARE_ an _RARE_ description . STO
* But then , neither was peaked . STO
* He could hear Mrs. Kirby now , warning her pale guest against sunburn . STO
* `` I spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say . STO
* `` He's that peaked kind '' . STO
* Surely there was a better word . STO
* Charlie looked in the mirror . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* He looked more closely . STO
* _RARE_ , feeble -- peaked . STO
* Clearly , two damp days with the _RARE_ _RARE_ had done him no good . STO
* The sun , _RARE_ hot as _RARE_ , was far from kind to Mrs. _RARE_ _RARE_ properties . STO
* When Charlie came up from the beach for his _RARE_ pill , the whole establishment ( _RARE_ enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a _RARE_ modern painting -- great blocks of _RARE_ color , _RARE_ at regular intervals by the _RARE_ white of five community _RARE_ . STO
* This weekend , he thought , he would look around for some more subdued retreat , with _RARE_ _RARE_ , maybe , at the door . STO
* He could not imagine a _RARE_ being brave enough to grow beside _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and the rest . STO
* The sweater was gone from the refrigerator , and in its place was a large plastic bag , full of wet pink clothes . STO
* No wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes . STO
* He got a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` Be my guest '' on the _RARE_ . STO
* It gave him a good feeling . STO
* `` _RARE_ . STO
* Thanks '' , was her answer the next day . STO
* The note was _RARE_ against his pill bottles and bore a _RARE_ : `` You're not at all well , are you '' ? STO
* `` I've got this cold '' , he wrote . STO
* Not that it was any of her business . STO
* `` It's none of my business '' , said the next note , `` but my Aunt _RARE_ used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold , and she lived to be _RARE_ . STO
* I mean , she's still living , and she's _RARE_ . STO
* Why don't you try that '' ? STO
* `` I don't have a lemon '' . STO
* He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper . STO
* By the next morning , she had turned the paper over . STO
* `` _RARE_ , neither do I '' . STO
* Charlie grinned . STO
* She didn't sound like a pale girl . STO
* She sounded a little like a redhead . STO
* But then , _RARE_ are often pale . STO
* He stuck his head in Mrs. _RARE_ little _RARE_ office . STO
* `` I guess that redhead next to me took your advice . STO
* I haven't seen her on the beach '' . STO
* `` You won't , if you're looking for a redhead . STO
* She's got _RARE_ hair '' . STO
* He spent that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , _RARE_ girl in a pink bathing suit . STO
* There were pink bathing suits on _RARE_ , and _RARE_ girls in red or black or green bathing suits . STO
* There were a _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and a _RARE_ of _RARE_ tank suits . STO
* Up on a _RARE_ , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an _RARE_ and absorbed in her painting . STO
* He paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* On the beach , there were pale girls and _RARE_ girls . STO
* And he saw them all as he walked up and down . STO
* At two that morning , he was still walking -- up and down _RARE_ , up and down the veranda , up and down the silent , _RARE_ beach . STO
* Finally , in _RARE_ , he opened the refrigerator , _RARE_ her hand lotion , and left a note . STO
* `` I've got this sunburn '' , said the note , `` and I used some of your hand lotion . STO
* Hope you don't mind '' . STO
* `` Of course I don't mind '' , she answered . STO
* `` You're having a miserable time , aren't you ? STO
* Use all the lotion you want , and for _RARE_ sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days '' . STO
* This was a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided . STO
* _RARE_ is a fine quality in a woman . STO
* Now Vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy . STO
* She felt , and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ; it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own . STO
* He didn't know what was so tough about _RARE_ world , _RARE_ around _RARE_ with _RARE_ . STO
* Suppose _RARE_ got a sunburn ? STO
* Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand lotion . STO
* She might _RARE_ him , once the worst of the agony was over . STO
* Charlie spent the next two days in his _RARE_ bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to _RARE_ , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion . STO
* _RARE_ passed back and forth . STO
* `` How's your sunburn now ? STO
* The only thing , this lotion has _RARE_ in it , and that _RARE_ the skin , so if you're so anxious to get a tan , you may not want to use it '' . STO
* `` I'm not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair '' . STO
* `` That Mrs. Kirby ! STO
* I'll bet she told you I was _RARE_ , too . STO
* How's your cold '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ out . STO
* She didn't say you were _RARE_ . STO
* Are you ? STO
* What's _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ goes with pale and peaked . STO
* Do you have anything to read while you're shut up ? STO
* There are two things here about _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , and a book called ' Tom _RARE_ and His _RARE_ _RARE_ ' ; ; but the picture of Tom _RARE_ is pretty sinister . STO
* Also the _RARE_ '' . STO
* There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot . STO
* The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an _RARE_ fast ball that took a _RARE_ . STO
* For a few _RARE_ the Anniston team couldn't figure him out . STO
* Then , in the fifth , _RARE_ kid catcher caught onto a curve and _RARE_ the ball into left center field . STO
* Eddie Lee , _RARE_ _RARE_ playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him . STO
* Phil Rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the _RARE_ . STO
* Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil . STO
* `` Third ! STO
* Third base '' ! STO
* Eddie shouted . STO
* Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike _RARE_ hands on third base . STO
* Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag . STO
* But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late . STO
* He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face . STO
* `` You bastard '' ! STO
* The Anniston catcher screamed . STO
* He jumped to his feet and started to throw _RARE_ . STO
* Mike Deegan tossed his _RARE_ away and began to swing at the catcher . STO
* This brought in everybody from both sides , while the _RARE_ stood up and added to the _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ were separated in a few minutes . STO
* The game was resumed . STO
* But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now . STO
* When the _RARE_ was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout . STO
* Phil Rossoff , coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink . STO
* Mike Deegan was standing beside it , facing the field . STO
* He was _RARE_ the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the _RARE_ began . STO
* `` Keep your eyes open , _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Mike yelled to the catcher . STO
* `` You're in for trouble '' . STO
* The Anniston catcher did not reply with words . STO
* He simply turned to Mike and smiled . STO
* This so _RARE_ Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I'll get that little bastard . STO
* So help me God , I'll get him '' . STO
* Phil Rossoff said : `` Why don't you leave him alone '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ your own goddamn business '' , Mike Deegan said . STO
* Phil shrugged . STO
* He stepped into the dugout , wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble . STO
* Maybe the answer was in his eyes . STO
* When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips . STO
* In the last of the sixth _RARE_ Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left _RARE_ head . STO
* By the time the _RARE_ got his hands on the ball Deegan was _RARE_ third base and heading for home . STO
* The left _RARE_ threw and it was a good one . STO
* But Mike had no chance of being _RARE_ . STO
* The Anniston catcher was _RARE_ home plate . STO
* All Deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he _RARE_ into the catcher . STO
* Both fell heavily to the ground . STO
* Only Mike got to his feet . STO
* He went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back . STO
* The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field . STO
* They poured water over their _RARE_ face . STO
* He did not move . STO
* Then the manager called for a doctor . STO
* The Riverside _RARE_ came down to look over the injured _RARE_ . STO
* Then , quickly , and a little _RARE_ , the doctor ordered a couple of _RARE_ to carry the catcher into the dressing room . STO
* Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching . STO
* When the _RARE_ started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the _RARE_ '' . STO
* Phil Rossoff , seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench . STO
* The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout . STO
* He was followed by four of his men . STO
* It began to look as if something was going to happen . STO
* Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer . STO
* Eddie Lee moved over to Mike _RARE_ side . STO
* No one said a word . STO
* The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike . STO
* His face was flushed . STO
* `` Deegan '' , the manager said , his voice _RARE_ low , quivering . STO
* `` That was a _RARE_ thing to do '' . STO
* `` For God's sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away . STO
* `` Stop it , will you ? STO
* Tell your guys not to block the plate '' . STO
* `` You didn't have to _RARE_ him '' . STO
* `` That's what you say '' . STO
* The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee . STO
* It was a cold and calculated look . STO
* He turned and went back across the field to his dugout . STO
* He called in the pitcher who had been _RARE_ , and a big , heavy , _RARE_ built right _RARE_ moved out to the _RARE_ for Anniston . STO
* The game started again and in the eighth _RARE_ Mike Deegan came up to bat . STO
* Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting . STO
* The first ball the _RARE_ pitcher threw came in for Mike's head . STO
* Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him . STO
* He arose slowly and brushed himself off . STO
* He got back into the _RARE_ box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again . STO
* `` _RARE_ the bum '' ! STO
* Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench . STO
* In the Riverside dugout Frankie _RARE_ , _RARE_ , whispered into _RARE_ ear : `` There's gonna be a fight '' . STO
* `` Look at those bastards '' ! STO
* Charlie _RARE_ , a pitcher , said . STO
* `` They're looking for trouble '' . STO
* Mike was slow getting into the box this time . STO
* When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in . STO
* `` Listen '' ! STO
* He shouted to the pitcher . STO
* `` One more and I'm coming out there '' ! STO
* `` I'll be waiting '' ! STO
* The pitcher yelled back . STO
* Mike Deegan _RARE_ the rubber plate with the end of his bat . STO
* He stood _RARE_ in the box , but not very close to the plate now . STO
* The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head . STO
* Deegan dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the _RARE_ . STO
* The pitcher tossed his _RARE_ away and came towards Mike Deegan . STO
* They were both walking towards each other , _RARE_ . STO
* Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field . STO
* In the next moment , it seemed , the _RARE_ was crowded with _RARE_ , _RARE_ , cops , kids and a dog . STO
* There was much shouting and screaming . STO
* _RARE_ sprang up and were quickly _RARE_ . STO
* Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together . STO
* Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started . STO
* After the game , Phil was taking off his _RARE_ in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in . STO
* `` It's a _RARE_ thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a _RARE_ own _RARE_ won't come out and help him in a fight '' . STO
* Phil sighed and pulled the wet _RARE_ over his head . STO
* Frankie _RARE_ sat down on the bench near Phil . STO
* The other players were _RARE_ quietly . STO
* Eddie Lee had not come in yet . STO
* Mike went over to Phil and stood over him . STO
* `` Why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me '' ? STO
* `` I didn't think it was necessary '' . STO
* `` Well ! STO
* Now that's just fine ! STO
* You didn't think it was necessary '' . STO
* Mike placed both his hands on his hips . STO
* He pushed his jaw forward . STO
* `` Listen , wise guy , if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy '' . STO
* Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face . STO
* `` I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly . STO
* `` Nobody else did , either '' . STO
* `` You trying to say I started the fight '' ? STO
* `` I'm not trying to say anything '' . STO
* Phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You're yellow , Rossoff '' ! STO
* And Phil _RARE_ his locker door shut and spun around . STO
* But before anything could happen Frankie _RARE_ was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room . STO
* `` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said . STO
* Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door . STO
* He sat down before _RARE_ desk . STO
* `` I'm doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly . STO
* `` You get your _RARE_ release as of today '' . STO
* _RARE_ eyes _RARE_ just a trifle . STO
* `` The best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home . STO
* You don't belong in professional baseball '' . STO
* Phil had to clear his throat . STO
* `` Is this because of what happened out there '' ? STO
* `` No '' , Eddie said . STO
* `` But it does confirm what I've suspected all along '' . STO
* Phil stood up . STO
* `` Listen ! STO
* This is the second time . STO
* '' `` _RARE_ down , sit down '' , Eddie said . STO
* `` I'm not saying you're yellow . STO
* I am saying you're not a professional _RARE_ '' . STO
* Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk . STO
* `` Now listen to me , Phil . STO
* I'm not steering you wrong . STO
* You haven't got the heart for baseball '' . STO
* Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned . STO
* Suddenly his voice grew hard . STO
* `` What the hell do you think baseball is ? STO
* You're not in the big _RARE_ , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there '' ? STO
* Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short . STO
* `` Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are . STO
* I know you've got talent . STO
* But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with . STO
* The heart , Phil . STO
* You just haven't got the heart for _RARE_ , and that's it '' . STO
* _RARE_ , Phil said : `` I don't get it . STO
* My batting average '' Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly . STO
* `` What difference does your batting average make ? STO
* Or your _RARE_ average . STO
* Or even the way you run bases . STO
* I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it . STO
* That's what I mean by no heart for the game . STO
* _RARE_ no _RARE_ . STO
* Deegan had no business _RARE_ into that kid out there . STO
* He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on . STO
* What the hell do you think baseball is ? STO
* A _RARE_ ? STO
* It's a way of life , _RARE_ ! STO
* And you've got to be ready to cut to _RARE_ anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you '' ! STO
* He's wrong ! STO
* Phil thought . STO
* It's only his opinion . STO
* There were other _RARE_ in this _RARE_ . STO
* He stood up slowly . STO
* He was a little pale and _RARE_ . STO
* His lips felt glued together . STO
* `` I think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally . STO
* Eddie nodded . STO
* `` Okay . STO
* You'll get your pay in the morning '' . STO
* Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` _RARE_ you'll see I was right '' . STO
* Phil shut the door behind him . STO
* Outside in the dressing room , Frankie _RARE_ sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes . STO
* `` What happened '' ? STO
* Frankie asked . STO
* Phil said : `` I got my release '' . STO
* `` You crazy '' ? STO
* Phil shrugged . STO
* `` What for '' ? STO
* Phil sighed . STO
* Frankie shook his head . STO
* `` I don't get it '' . STO
* `` I don't know '' , Phil said . STO
* They were silent for a few moments . STO
* Then Frankie said : `` What are you gonna do '' ? STO
* Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again . STO
* Phil took off one shoe and stared at it . STO
* `` Don't take it like this '' , Frankie said . STO
* `` Hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later . STO
* The _RARE_ are full of guys like that '' . STO
* Phil was very quiet . STO
* `` What are you gonna do , Phil '' ? STO
* Phil did not answer . STO
* `` Why not try another club '' ? STO
* Phil looked up . STO
* What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that ? STO
* `` _RARE_ in tomorrow '' , Frankie said . STO
* `` _RARE_ to Whitey Jackson '' . STO
* He just didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that . STO
* `` Will you do it , Phil '' ? STO
* `` Do what '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ Whitey for a job '' . STO
* Phil nodded . STO
* `` Sure '' , he said . STO
* `` _RARE_ come in tomorrow '' ? STO
* Frankie nodded . STO
* `` I'll speak to Whitey '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ boy '' . STO
* `` I'll talk to him , all right '' . STO
* `` Don't worry '' , Frankie said . STO
* `` You'll get a job there . STO
* He needs _RARE_ bad '' . STO
* `` I'm not worried about it '' , Phil said . STO
* `` That's the way to talk . STO
* What else did Eddie have to say '' ? STO
* `` Nothing '' , Phil said . STO
* _RARE_ next interest seemed the product of his _RARE_ . STO
* His broad reading took him into certain _RARE_ of religion and the subject of religion began to _RARE_ him . STO
* When he was twelve he took to reading St. _RARE_ and _RARE_ , then _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ by endless _RARE_ and numerous _RARE_ papers . STO
* For his birthday , because Richard had seen them in a store and asked for them , his mother bought him the _RARE_ and a little image of the Indian god , Acala . STO
* And one day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled The _RARE_ of the Dead , which she suspected Richard would enjoy . STO
* He was enormously happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read . STO
* At dinner one night , when he was fourteen , Richard announced , `` There is only one god '' . STO
* `` Did you think there were two '' ? STO
* _RARE_ his father . STO
* `` You don't understand '' , Richard said _RARE_ . STO
* Through quiet laughter his mother said , `` Don't speak to your father like that , Richard '' . STO
* Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again . STO
* His interest in the formal study of religion _RARE_ when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in _RARE_ affairs . STO
* Although he still didn't speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` The future lies in Asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he _RARE_ from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in _RARE_ studies . STO
* Richard was a solitary student in New York and acquired , in his _RARE_ , a thorough if _RARE_ knowledge of _RARE_ lore , literature , life , politics and history . STO
* He was _RARE_ a _RARE_ to continue his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes , the biwa upon which he had been _RARE_ and his image of Acala , and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country . STO
* The week at home was not comfortable . STO
* His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his _RARE_ off by himself for an _RARE_ which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be _RARE_ . STO
* She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested . STO
* `` Do you still have The _RARE_ of the Dead '' ? STO
* She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you'd like it '' . STO
* `` Yes '' , he _RARE_ to _RARE_ the conversation , `` I still have it '' . STO
* He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject . STO
* As for The _RARE_ of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been _RARE_ in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York . STO
* He had _RARE_ each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames . STO
* Then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried . STO
* Richard left America with his clothes , his biwa and his image of Acala and , on the _RARE_ which took him to Japan , he _RARE_ at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he _RARE_ _RARE_ an ancient Japanese tune he had once heard . STO
* During his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure . STO
* He _RARE_ from his cabin late that night and crept out into a _RARE_ North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water . STO
* It was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the _RARE_ rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it . STO
* It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind . STO
* In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend . STO
* An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident _RARE_ to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her . STO
* He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching _RARE_ of Tokyo . STO
* In Charlotte , Richard saw a _RARE_ and a _RARE_ for doing things which , after a fashion , he _RARE_ . STO
* In time , he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity . STO
* She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small _RARE_ parties she held at her rooms and in the end he _RARE_ with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random _RARE_ . STO
* At one such gathering Charlotte announced , `` I was at Ryusenji today . STO
* Have you ever been to Ryusenji '' ? STO
* No one had . STO
* `` Well , it's at _RARE_ and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool . STO
* I was thoroughly startled '' . STO
* Richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but _RARE_ manner during the _RARE_ was more _RARE_ and _RARE_ than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the _RARE_ words which had preceded it . STO
* Three of the four persons present , all foreign students in Tokyo , had been playing a game of _RARE_ popular Japanese foods by the In and Out system , an equation in which _RARE_ philosophy was used as the modifier . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ and tea were In because they could be taken _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ was Out because it was _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ was In , Samuel Burns had suggested , because it was too far Out to stay Out , even if it was a little _RARE_ . STO
* Richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game , the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears . STO
* `` He wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him '' , said Charlotte . STO
* `` Did you watch him '' ? STO
* Asked a _RARE_ girl named _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` I shouldn't have been able to do that '' . STO
* `` Well I was able to do it '' , Charlotte said with no sign of _RARE_ . STO
* `` For a minute , anyhow . STO
* I'm surprised no one has been there . STO
* I've been there a number of times . STO
* Sam , I thought you knew everything about Tokyo . STO
* You've never been to Ryusenji '' ? STO
* `` I've heard about it '' , Samuel Burns said . STO
* `` There's a little place there called _RARE_ _RARE_ dedicated to _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Yes , a little _RARE_ place '' , Charlotte said , and concluded , `` _RARE_ , it's all very nice . STO
* And the man who brought sweet potatoes into _RARE_ is _RARE_ there , next to a beautiful seated _RARE_ of Fudo . STO
* Oh , that's what I meant to tell you . STO
* This is the interesting part , Richard '' , she had a _RARE_ habit of trying to pull him into the talking . STO
* `` There was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' -- `` My God , it was cold today '' , said Samuel Burns . STO
* `` _RARE_ or twenty-three '' . STO
* `` And the water would be still _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ seemed to _RARE_ at the thought of it . STO
* `` And your golden god '' , said Samuel Burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath . STO
* It would kill one of us '' . STO
* `` But the point is '' , Charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at Ryusenji , all in worship of Fudo , the god of fire '' . STO
* _RARE_ dark eyes came up and seemed for the _RARE_ moment to reflect sharp light . STO
* It was true ; ; Fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese _RARE_ of Acala . STO
* The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening . STO
* He found himself trying to remember something , but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall . STO
* He had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy _RARE_ of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching . STO
* Perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ at Ryusenji , he was unable to put it together . STO
* That night , after leaving _RARE_ apartment , Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room . STO
* When he at last did go to his room , he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of Acala , thinking first of _RARE_ tale of the man at Ryusenji , then of his biwa and the invisible Pacific waters . STO
* And the next morning , not sure of why he went , he took the train to _RARE_ and walked to Ryusenji . STO
* He was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned . STO
* He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large _RARE_ high at the back of the pool . STO
* On the hillside above was _RARE_ what might have been an _RARE_ of Fudo , or perhaps a _RARE_ . STO
* The strange creature , _RARE_ in wire , made him _RARE_ . STO
* The sensation he so _RARE_ realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be _RARE_ to the _RARE_ green water or the little _RARE_ or the green _RARE_ _RARE_ beyond his reach . STO
* He left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him . STO
* _RARE_ a little well before the temple he dropped a _RARE_ coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of _RARE_ ; ; but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple _RARE_ . STO
* Instead , he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated Fudo at their head . STO
* The black Fudo seemed to stare _RARE_ back at him and _RARE_ eyes were caught by the _RARE_ in _RARE_ , and then Richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of _RARE_ face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound , as if the large _RARE_ were about to burst from some pressure within it . STO
* Then the flames were gone , the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard began to tremble violently . STO
* Suddenly he _RARE_ his pockets of all his _RARE_ and dropped them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried back down both _RARE_ and away from the temple , never looking back . STO
* He walked all the miles back to his room . STO
* He seemed to have picked up a virus that day , because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot . STO
* He stayed home , reading and refusing to think about his _RARE_ experience at Ryusenji . STO
* But the process of refusing to think about it was an active _RARE_ in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day . STO
* The cold _RARE_ , making sleep difficult that night , and he remained in bed still the next morning , now unable to keep from thinking about the _RARE_ sight of burning metal , the _RARE_ sound , the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life . STO
* All of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at _RARE_ . STO
* I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was _RARE_ the _RARE_ field far across the hill from the farm buildings . STO
* It had grown hot early that day , and I hoped that the boy , my brother's son , would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground , carrying the jar of cool water . STO
* The boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water , and he always dragged an old _RARE_ _RARE_ or a stick along , to play with . STO
* He pretended that the _RARE_ was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips . STO
* I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time . STO
* I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . STO
* It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the _RARE_ . STO
* The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly . STO
* The snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the furrow and did not go any further . STO
* I had never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful . STO
* He was _RARE_ and _RARE_ and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and _RARE_ head only so slightly . STO
* Go out of the furrow , snake , I said , but it did not move at all . STO
* I pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only flicked its black , _RARE_ tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without _RARE_ or concern . STO
* I let the engine idle then , and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it . STO
* My movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed _RARE_ a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly . STO
* I followed it , looking at the brilliant colors on its _RARE_ back , the colors clear and sharp and perfect , in orange and green and brown _RARE_ the size of a baby's fist down its back , and the _RARE_ were set one within the other and _RARE_ with glistening _RARE_ . STO
* The colors were astonishing , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that _RARE_ flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm . STO
* The eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly . STO
* His flat and gracefully _RARE_ head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth . STO
* You beauty , I said , I couldn't kill you . STO
* You are much too beautiful . STO
* I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was _RARE_ that an animal such as that should die . STO
* I picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the _RARE_ of that _RARE_ , _RARE_ body , like _RARE_ ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of him , like _RARE_ swallowed whole might make . STO
* The body _RARE_ through my hands like cool _RARE_ , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the _RARE_ of that body . STO
* I lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , _RARE_ earth , from between my pale hands . STO
* The snake worked away very slowly and _RARE_ and with a _RARE_ kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled _RARE_ . STO
* The sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target . STO
* I felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake . STO
* It _RARE_ in its bright _RARE_ color against the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ black _RARE_ of soil and against the _RARE_ of myself . STO
* The color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien , too , in that dry and dusty and _RARE_ field . STO
* I got on the tractor again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks . STO
* I had my back to the corner of the _RARE_ field that pointed towards the house . STO
* The earth was a little heavy and I had to stop once and clean the _RARE_ because they were not _RARE_ properly , and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned the corner and was _RARE_ across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake . STO
* I saw it all at a glance . STO
* The boy was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the plowed earth , _RARE_ with _RARE_ and a kind of _RARE_ impatience . STO
* Even at that distance , with no sound but the sound of the tractor , I could tell the _RARE_ mark of brutality on the boy . STO
* I could see the _RARE_ shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the _RARE_ of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick . STO
* Stop it , I shouted , but the _RARE_ and mighty tractor roared on , above anything I could say . STO
* I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that _RARE_ , _RARE_ dance . STO
* It was no use . STO
* I felt myself tremble , thinking of the _RARE_ light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and _RARE_ , if I could , that _RARE_ _RARE_ , catch the boy in the moment of his _RARE_ , and save a _RARE_ , a _RARE_ , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late . STO
* I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ; I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on . STO
* My head began to _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon _RARE_ , or they _RARE_ . STO
* I felt the anger mount within me . STO
* The boy waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown _RARE_ in the heat of the morning . STO
* I knew the boy well . STO
* He was eleven and we had done many things together . STO
* He was a beautiful boy , really , with _RARE_ blonde hair and a smooth and still _RARE_ face , and his _RARE_ were long and dark and _RARE_ , and his eyes were blue . STO
* He waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day . STO
* He was my nephew , my brother's son , handsome and warm and _RARE_ , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well . STO
* I saw then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil , through something there where I had been not long before . STO
* I stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me . STO
* `` Can I ride around with you '' ? STO
* He asked , as he often did , and I had as often let him be on the tractor beside me . STO
* I looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ; the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his . STO
* `` No , you cannot '' , I said , pushing aside the water jar he offered to me . STO
* I pointed to the _RARE_ , upright stake . STO
* `` Did you do that '' ? STO
* I asked . STO
* `` Yes '' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement . STO
* `` I killed a snake ; ; it was a big one '' . STO
* He tried to take my hand to show me . STO
* `` Why did you kill it '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ are ugly and bad '' . STO
* `` This snake was very beautiful . STO
* Didn't you see how beautiful it was '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ are ugly '' , he said again . STO
* `` You saw the colors of it , didn't you ? STO
* Have you ever seen anything like it around here '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ are ugly and bad , and it might have _RARE_ somebody , and they would have died '' . STO
* `` You know there are no _RARE_ snakes in this area . STO
* This snake could not harm anything '' . STO
* `` They eat chickens sometimes '' , the boy said . STO
* `` They are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes '' . STO
* `` You are talking _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* `` You killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason '' . STO
* `` They're ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted . STO
* `` Nobody likes snakes '' . STO
* `` It was beautiful '' , I said , half to myself . STO
* The boy skipped along beside me , and he was _RARE_ with what he had done . STO
* The fire of the colors was gone ; ; there was a _RARE_ _RARE_ now ; ; the colors of its back were dull and _RARE_ , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy's shoes . STO
* The _RARE_ head , so delicate and so cool , had been _RARE_ as if in a _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ tongue _RARE_ out of the twisted , torn mouth . STO
* The snake was hideous , and I remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life . STO
* I _RARE_ the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the _RARE_ part of its body , between the colored _RARE_ crystals . STO
* I touched it and the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , was gone , and even then it moved a little , perhaps a tiny _RARE_ of the dead muscles , and I hoped that it was truly dead , so that I would not have to kill it . STO
* And then it moved a little more , and I knew the snake was dying , and I would have to kill it there . STO
* The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing _RARE_ in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips . STO
* I'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful . STO
* I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the _RARE_ from the _RARE_ and I struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live . STO
* The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake . STO
* `` It's a big snake , isn't it '' ? STO
* He said . STO
* `` I'm going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed '' . STO
* `` Don't you see what you have done '' ? STO
* I said . STO
* `` Don't you see the difference now '' ? STO
* `` It's an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said . STO
* He came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes . STO
* I could see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the _RARE_ brutality . STO
* `` Don't '' , I said . STO
* I could have slapped the boy . STO
* He looked up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side . STO
* I thought , you little _RARE_ , you _RARE_ , _RARE_ , little beast , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes . STO
* I wanted to _RARE_ his face , to wipe forever the _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ from his mouth , and I decided then , very suddenly , what I would do . STO
* Cady didn't come _RARE_ easily , but this had not been a day of glad _RARE_ . STO
* Tax worries , production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from Hanford College , his own _RARE_ _RARE_ , a real _RARE_ . STO
* Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago . STO
* Yes , the boy's _RARE_ were in order -- scholastic _RARE_ , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards . STO
* But due to the many applicants on file , would he _RARE_ and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership ? STO
* Cady Partlow lit his pipe with no comfort . STO
* This was it . STO
* This was the letter which would or would not _RARE_ his son , David , in Hanford . STO
* His son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life . STO
* His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief . STO
* He wondered if he had played it wrong . STO
* Maybe he should have kept in touch . STO
* _RARE_ back for _RARE_ . STO
* But he had been busy building a business , being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at Hanford , Class of _RARE_ . STO
* Besides , Cady Partlow knew he wasn't the _RARE_ . STO
* It wouldn't help anyway . STO
* Look at Pete _RARE_ , who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years . STO
* _RARE_ son was rejected . STO
* Hanford College , Little _RARE_ League , had no room for _RARE_ players with low grades . STO
* Cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride . STO
* Good solid B average with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ in _RARE_ and science . STO
* Imagine his son being that good in science ! STO
* Mr. Partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray _RARE_ as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford . STO
* But then , he hadn't studied very hard . STO
* _RARE_ elected president of the student body took a lot of time and _RARE_ . STO
* He put down his pipe and started to type . STO
* `` In response to your letter , I can in good conscience recommend my son , David , in the field of leadership '' . STO
* He stopped and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College . STO
* He didn't have to be told his son looked like him . STO
* David had the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* Health , excellent . STO
* He turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence . STO
* `` His interests range from _RARE_ and _RARE_ to electronics , tennis and swimming . STO
* His chief motivation for _RARE_ at Hanford is the desire to '' -- Mr. Partlow _RARE_ his fist on the _RARE_ , _RARE_ the letter . STO
* He paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build . STO
* How do you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do ? STO
* That you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club , `` Of course David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer '' -- or a lawyer , or an editor ? STO
* How do you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself ? STO
* Just give him time , give him a chance . STO
* Cady snapped the _RARE_ blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter , rolled in a fresh sheet , and gave his letter the same savage attention he _RARE_ on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head . STO
* What a production to make of a letter _RARE_ your own son ! STO
* His _RARE_ went up in _RARE_ at his _RARE_ panic . STO
* He told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics . STO
* He told Hanford his son had _RARE_ in numerous _RARE_ activities . STO
* He belonged to a social club , a civic group , little theater , swimming team , and had been president of the student _RARE_ as well as treasurer of the science club . STO
* He finished with a _RARE_ of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter . STO
* There , that did it . STO
* Then he met the grave eyes of his wife , Anne , from the photograph next to _RARE_ . STO
* He shoved the _RARE_ letter into his coat pocket . STO
* Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything . STO
* After all , his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products . STO
* Anne had a way with words . STO
* Half of it was natural , half was Smith College . STO
* Yet the whole of Anne was something she had never learned in any college . STO
* A woman had it or she didn't . STO
* Anne had it . STO
* She said what she meant and let it be . STO
* She never got on his back . STO
* He could take the advice or leave it . STO
* He whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator . STO
* `` You look like you just heard a real _RARE_ , Mr. Partlow '' . STO
* Cady looked at Tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years . STO
* `` I was just thinking how things have changed . STO
* When I went to college they begged you to come . STO
* Be our guest ! STO
* It's our pleasure ! STO
* Now you have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and _RARE_ with knowledge '' ! STO
* Tom slid open the door to the lobby . STO
* `` That's a fact , Mr. Partlow . STO
* My John applied to six colleges before he got in '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ to State '' ? STO
* `` No . STO
* He's president of the _RARE_ club here , you know . STO
* Always _RARE_ around with science stuff . STO
* _RARE_ bright along those lines , you might say . STO
* He got a science scholarship to _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Oh '' , said Mr. Partlow , `` that's fine , Tom . STO
* Just fine '' . STO
* As he drove home through the _RARE_ traffic , Cady felt the _RARE_ growing . STO
* He hadn't told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for David . STO
* They had all turned down his son . STO
* _RARE_ in leadership . STO
* So sorry . STO
* _RARE_ interests . STO
* So sorry . STO
* No clear motivation . STO
* So sorry . STO
* He suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty _RARE_ expensive house that he needed the _RARE_ Anne had waiting for him . STO
* But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed _RARE_ gave no _RARE_ from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket . STO
* Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did . STO
* He liked looking at Anne . STO
* Most people did . STO
* He liked her blond hair and the _RARE_ of _RARE_ across her nose . STO
* From those _RARE_ eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as David did . STO
* She always could sense the _RARE_ end of a _RARE_ day . STO
* `` Board meeting tonight , Cady '' ? STO
* `` No , I begged off . STO
* _RARE_ to do '' . STO
* `` Can I have the car , Dad '' ? STO
* `` Why not let him take it , Cady ? STO
* I know it is _RARE_ , but it's only eight days before _RARE_ . STO
* Let's forget the rules '' . STO
* Cady , deep in thought , neither heard nor answered . STO
* David grinned . STO
* _RARE_ he put down his steak knife and said loudly , `` Mr. _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Cady _RARE_ head came up like that of the _RARE_ fire horse . STO
* `` I'm sorry , Dave . STO
* The car ? STO
* Of course you can have it '' . STO
* Dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else , slowly , methodically and with interest . STO
* `` _RARE_ anything from Hanford yet , Dad '' ? STO
* Cady begged the question . STO
* `` Don't worry about it , Dave . STO
* Your acceptance will come through '' . STO
* Dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys . STO
* `` Don't be too sure , Dad . STO
* Charles _RARE_ got turned down by _RARE_ and he is a _RARE_ student '' . STO
* Anne said it wasn't surprising because Charles was _RARE_ , a lone _RARE_ , and completely _RARE_ . STO
* `` I can hardly say the same about you , Dave '' ! STO
* Dave kissed her lightly . STO
* `` _RARE_ , my dear parent , are here to stay ! STO
* Get my old man to bed early . STO
* He looks a little bit _RARE_ '' . STO
* Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the _RARE_ . STO
* `` Let's go into the library . STO
* You do seem somewhat _RARE_ '' . STO
* Cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable _RARE_ room . STO
* `` I didn't know I looked so _RARE_ '' ! STO
* `` _RARE_ word , darling . STO
* Your _RARE_ has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it . STO
* _RARE_ any help '' ? STO
* `` In a way , yes . STO
* Hanford College hasn't decided on _RARE_ application yet . STO
* They want a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership . STO
* Here's what I wrote '' . STO
* Cady handed her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was _RARE_ . STO
* Already he could feel _RARE_ questioning eyes . STO
* `` I know you wrote this in a hurry , but , Cady , Dave was only acting president of the student _RARE_ for a few days . STO
* That was when half the school was down with _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` But he was president '' . STO
* `` And he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club . STO
* He just took over the week Bill _RARE_ was in the state _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* Cady stuck his jaw out . STO
* `` The fact remains he was treasurer '' . STO
* `` And the swimming team . STO
* No , Cady , he made second team . STO
* Just missed the first '' . STO
* `` A team is a team '' , insisted Cady . STO
* `` Anything else '' ? STO
* `` Yes '' , she said quietly . STO
* `` I don't think you've been quite honest , Cady . STO
* It isn't like you . STO
* _RARE_ interests . STO
* _RARE_ . STO
* He was mad about stars at the age of nine . STO
* _RARE_ , You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the _RARE_ six years ago ! STO
* Those aren't his interests now '' . STO
* `` What do you suggest '' ? STO
* `` Just say he likes swimming , tennis , _RARE_ and music '' . STO
* `` Music ! STO
* He hasn't been to a _RARE_ _RARE_ all season '' . STO
* Anne smiled . STO
* `` But he plays bass with Chief _RARE_ _RARE_ and his Five _RARE_ '' ! STO
* `` You mean that _RARE_ _RARE_ ? STO
* Even in that he never _RARE_ like Jack on _RARE_ or _RARE_ on _RARE_ . STO
* He's -- he's just there , that's all '' . STO
* `` Yes , he's just there . STO
* He keeps the beat going . STO
* He likes to play bass because he doesn't have to _RARE_ . STO
* He doesn't like to rise and _RARE_ . STO
* Don't worry , Cady , he'll be back in the _RARE_ fold by next year '' . STO
* Cady appeared slightly _RARE_ . STO
* `` All right . STO
* But I refuse to be _RARE_ honest and mention Chief _RARE_ _RARE_ and his Five _RARE_ '' . STO
* Anne laughed and Cady felt the tension _RARE_ its grip on the back of his neck . STO
* `` Maybe I am _RARE_ it a bit , Anne '' , he said . STO
* `` But you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college . STO
* He has to have leadership as well as grades '' . STO
* Anne folded the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` Did you know he is advertising his _RARE_ equipment for sale this weekend ? STO
* He hasn't used it now for several years . STO
* Can you really say his motivation for college is electronics '' ? STO
* Cady felt the _RARE_ as though he had stepped off the curb on his _RARE_ . STO
* `` And what would you say he wants to do ? STO
* Just what '' ? STO
* `` It's Dave who is applying to Hanford College . STO
* Why don't you ask him '' ? STO
* For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back . STO
* `` I have talked to him , but you know I've never tried to push him into any profession . STO
* I won't be guilty of trying to run his life '' . STO
* Anne picked up the _RARE_ she was _RARE_ for the hospital _RARE_ . STO
* `` Just because your father tried to make a _RARE_ out of you , you've leaned over backward to keep your hands off . STO
* But _RARE_ you've wanted him to _RARE_ to your mold . STO
* You want him to be a leader of men , like you '' . STO
* Cady put the _RARE_ chip back on his shoulder . STO
* `` Dave has qualities of leadership . STO
* He just hasn't developed them yet . STO
* Give him time '' . STO
* He never will , Cady . STO
* Not the kind of leadership you mean , working with lots of people . STO
* All your _RARE_ thinking won't change that . STO
* Remember what you used to say in the Army ? STO
* You can't run a war with _RARE_ _RARE_ and one private '' ! STO
* Cady walked the block to the _RARE_ , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne . STO
* Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all . STO
* And once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions . STO
* The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life . STO
* _RARE_ awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind . STO
* When he rose in the morning , the image was still there . STO
* He had always been a _RARE_ and _RARE_ man . STO
* In his _RARE_ days , his bedroom had been _RARE_ with clothes which his mother , or later the hotel maid , generally saw fit to put in order . STO
* No doubt Dolores _RARE_ following in their footsteps . STO
* But it was fun those first days , kidding about the trail of _RARE_ he left _RARE_ across the rug . STO
* There was an _RARE_ _RARE_ in his grinning refusal to pick them up . STO
* Half _RARE_ he enjoyed seeing her _RARE_ to lift the things . STO
* He remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party . STO
* The smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like _RARE_ . STO
* Her hair was the color of those _RARE_ which in seed _RARE_ are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of _RARE_ or _RARE_ or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad _RARE_ of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of _RARE_ which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness . STO
* So he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair . STO
* Or against her back , pressed on the column of _RARE_ , which held her so _RARE_ straight and _RARE_ , until the _RARE_ of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises , like the snapped stem of a _RARE_ . STO
* But , to put it _RARE_ , nothing snapped . STO
* Yet that had not seriously troubled him , not then . STO
* They married . STO
* More he could take at _RARE_ . STO
* All Martin thought he needed was time : to what better use could time be put ? STO
* He saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly . STO
* There was too little occasion _RARE_ for resistance , the brave strong _RARE_ of emotional _RARE_ and meeting . STO
* They had left themselves too much to discover . STO
* But , at the start , his new life felt _RARE_ . STO
* Good . STO
* It was on the _RARE_ day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon ? STO
* ) that he dropped the shorts on the floor . STO
* `` Now , I'm not going to pick up those shorts '' ! STO
* Martin gave her a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` I think you'll get tired of them there '' . STO
* In the morning the shorts were where he had left them . STO
* He smiled to himself , and decided not to mention them till Dolores did . STO
* It was almost too easy . STO
* For he had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests . STO
* The shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening . STO
* He was wrong . STO
* The rest of the bedroom had been _RARE_ to a _RARE_ _RARE_ , but in the middle of the carpet lay the _RARE_ shorts . STO
* They gave the room a strange note of _RARE_ , like a _RARE_ on a beautiful face . STO
* He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous . STO
* _RARE_ he determined to foil her . STO
* I can be as stubborn as she can , he thought ; ; my nerves are as strong . STO
* She'll rush to the bedroom when the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It rang . STO
* Ten minutes early . STO
* Martin was standing a few feet from the front door . STO
* He swung around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away . STO
* Dolores stood motionless in the doorway . STO
* He could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to _RARE_ the shorts . STO
* Martin turned his back . STO
* He strode to answer the bell . STO
* _RARE_ hat was deposited in the hall closet . STO
* With the most casual and relaxed manner in the world , Dolores led _RARE_ to the bedroom . STO
* Martin strained his ears . STO
* At first he could not be sure . STO
* Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there . STO
* A _RARE_ of _RARE_ slid over their voices . STO
* All evening _RARE_ favored him with odd , _RARE_ looks . STO
* Clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word '' . STO
* For some reason , this _RARE_ in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other _RARE_ . STO
* At last there was a void no one could fill . STO
* The _RARE_ went home early . STO
* Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night . STO
* As violently as possible . STO
* But he was so taken _RARE_ , he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in . STO
* On the contrary , it would only _RARE_ his position if he _RARE_ , while she stayed calm and _RARE_ . STO
* And if he _RARE_ after _RARE_ at her . STO
* He _RARE_ . STO
* Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? STO
* At once . STO
* He considered the sober possibility . STO
* In his head was the echo of those _RARE_ with _RARE_ . STO
* There was something about private _RARE_ _RARE_ which always made him feel _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* He remembered his mother _RARE_ with her neighborhood women friends , _RARE_ her voice to a penetrating _RARE_ which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening . STO
* He could even recall the last time he sat there . STO
* She was talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` _RARE_ Martin said he was sorry . STO
* He _RARE_ so sweetly , I couldn't keep being annoyed with him '' . STO
* It wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time ; ; he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened , which was as honest as he could put it . STO
* But his mother told the story over and over , till her `` Martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , _RARE_ ears . STO
* The battle had to be fought . STO
* Let the best sex win . STO
* But his resolution hardly seemed to help . STO
* If the situation had been bad , it now got worse . STO
* About this time people began `` dropping in '' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough . STO
* _RARE_ Martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip -- preferably one that lasted months -- instead of deciding not to _RARE_ the date until he could get away . STO
* Here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by . STO
* These stray people nearly always insisted on Dolores showing them around the apartment . STO
* Of course , the _RARE_ of inspection included the _RARE_ shorts . STO
* It was curious how the different visitors took this . STO
* Some tried to ignore the _RARE_ on the _RARE_ countenance . STO
* Others asked . STO
* Quite a few laughed . STO
* To them all Dolores told a _RARE_ and _RARE_ tale . STO
* `` It's a little contest Martin and I have '' , she would begin _RARE_ , carrying the _RARE_ through a _RARE_ and _RARE_ course . STO
* While he waited in the living room . STO
* Once Martin went along . STO
* They entered the bedroom , and Dolores said nothing . STO
* Then one of the guests showed his _RARE_ . STO
* `` You were in a hurry , weren't you '' ? STO
* Martin would have liked to break the man's neck . STO
* Dolores smiled ; ; she let the interpretation stand . STO
* Now Martin heard himself give a _RARE_ of mock good nature . STO
* With her eyes Dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin : It's a little contest -- Never again did he enter into the _RARE_ of showing the apartment . STO
* They kept up a rigid _RARE_ of speaking relations . STO
* But Martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything . STO
* What to talk about ? STO
* Dolores kept picking up any of his clothes ( except the _RARE_ shorts ) which he left about , but he had been robbed of pleasure in _RARE_ his possessions . STO
* He fell into the habit of putting his clothes in _RARE_ and _RARE_ , so his life might _RARE_ as little as possible on hers . STO
* The shorts alone remained . STO
* In his moments of worst agony , Martin imagined what his friends were saying . STO
* The sound of their amazement . STO
* _RARE_ : He could hear the word . STO
* The most _RARE_ situation . STO
* We were up to visit them and He had thought her exactly what he wanted . STO
* Six weeks of marriage and I'm using the past tense , he told himself furiously . STO
* _RARE_ his idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now . STO
* Everyone would know why ; ; he would cut a _RARE_ ridiculous figure . STO
* He was trapped . STO
* Day and night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself . STO
* His mind _RARE_ frantically , seeking an exit . STO
* _RARE_ he had periods of _RARE_ _RARE_ in which he determined _RARE_ , _RARE_ , to live out his life in this fashion . STO
* Nothing would change , nothing would ever change . STO
* When the solution finally came to him , one night while he was in bed , he was so shaken by its _RARE_ that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before . STO
* In a _RARE_ of excitement , he considered his plan . STO
* _RARE_ his shorts , he would place something of hers . STO
* _RARE_ he would have won an _RARE_ moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her _RARE_ , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same . STO
* He felt that it would be a particular _RARE_ to Dolores to pick up her own _RARE_ which he had laid on the floor . STO
* Furthermore , he could go on repeating the _RARE_ _RARE_ : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a _RARE_ , or maybe a _RARE_ , next to his shorts . STO
* _RARE_ or later , Dolores would crack . STO
* On the other hand , if she didn't remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which _RARE_ the apartment . STO
* Martin guessed that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story . STO
* The tale , he thought , would become less gay . STO
* She had used his _RARE_ shorts as the very image of his _RARE_ , his lack of control , his general male _RARE_ , while she remained cool , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , the charming teacher who _RARE_ an _RARE_ body . STO
* To have her _RARE_ linked with his on the floor would draw her _RARE_ into a struggle both bitter and absurd . STO
* Something in the back of his mind was aware that the _RARE_ of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and _RARE_ were involved , because it was truly his . STO
* The knowledge kept him from _RARE_ his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The next morning , while Dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of _RARE_ _RARE_ pants , and _RARE_ dropped them next to his shorts . STO
* He sat down on the bed . STO
* In a surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared . STO
* To his delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two _RARE_ . STO
* Slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the _RARE_ with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second . STO
* Ah , he thought , she's going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too . STO
* He saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him . STO
* _RARE_ her fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room . STO
* She did not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes _RARE_ . STO
* They _RARE_ together , but Martin did not refer to his triumph , and Dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , _RARE_ up and down from the table so that talk was impossible . STO
* Well , Martin thought , That'll save . STO
* He left for work in high spirits . STO
* As he relaxed that day , Martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks . STO
* He found that he no longer hated Dolores ( he knew how much he had hated her ) , and he was surprised at a _RARE_ of an _RARE_ feeling . STO
* `` Good old A-Z '' , Cap said . STO
* `` You know , I've got one of your cars at home . STO
* As a prominent _RARE_ , you ought to be interested in his _RARE_ support group . STO
* Isn't his _RARE_ down your alley '' ? STO
* Once it was , William thought . STO
* But not any more . STO
* A rush of memory swept him back , and he forgot Cap . STO
* How did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? STO
* _RARE_ enough , through the _RARE_ agency of his _RARE_ . STO
* General _RARE_ draft and Doc _RARE_ and Cap were responsible for his first _RARE_ , but _RARE_ Freddy _RARE_ could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time . STO
* Freddy needed a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and _RARE_ financing by _RARE_ , and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him with one . STO
* Mr. Willis bought Zenith _RARE_ Products , a _RARE_ corporation of _RARE_ which had undergone many _RARE_ and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long Island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed Freddy in an executive position . STO
* _RARE_ after , Freddy had his usual _RARE_ of bold ideas . STO
* Willis listened patiently , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ; he generally heard _RARE_ suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own _RARE_ concerns . STO
* Probably Mr. Willis was _RARE_ toward deeper _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ and a concern for his _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ began to aid Freddy with her father , _RARE_ , no doubt , by _RARE_ open contempt for Freddy and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Another factor must have been the eventual disposal of _RARE_ fortune ; ; she _RARE_ assumed that the more he was _RARE_ with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy _RARE_ upon his death . STO
* Whatever the reasons , Willis and _RARE_ started expanding Zenith . STO
* They acquired another electronics factory , a specialized _RARE_ company , an organization that built -- very experimentally -- _RARE_ research _RARE_ . STO
* Since they were hunting for national defense contracts , Adam _RARE_ , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections . STO
* _RARE_ his power , Freddy looked for additional _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ industry , _RARE_ toward _RARE_ government _RARE_ , attracted him . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ Company , a _RARE_ firm which manufactured _RARE_ vehicles and other _RARE_ equipment , had recently constructed an _RARE_ , modern plant in a burst of _RARE_ optimism . STO
* _RARE_ with a _RARE_ management and _RARE_ stockholders , it was ripe for _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ was to keep growing by stock _RARE_ and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences . STO
* With _RARE_ _RARE_ , he was convinced that _RARE_ Wisconsin _RARE_ would be ideal for conversion to _RARE_ _RARE_ , tanks , missiles or _RARE_ of some kind . STO
* At that point William came into the picture . STO
* Although not much _RARE_ the account , he had been appointed advertising head of Zenith . STO
* _RARE_ of routine by having his own firm and a _RARE_ partner , his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ; and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did , he was at least _RARE_ by the chance of wider opportunities . STO
* Mr. Willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the _RARE_ of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to Wisconsin and Washington . STO
* In the end , he said : `` I'm not _RARE_ by the proposition , sir . STO
* I know a guy named Jack Hamrick , a very bright young engineer who was with _RARE_ , and I took him with me to _RARE_ . STO
* It's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind . STO
* The conversion will cost a fortune . STO
* Besides that , I'm acquainted more or less with the defense _RARE_ situation through my contacts in the Air Force . STO
* I think Adam _RARE_ is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side . STO
* _RARE_ have thrown everything up for _RARE_ , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here . STO
* The future of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet _RARE_ have _RARE_ the _RARE_ trade -- one jet can take the place of three _RARE_ planes . STO
* This means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough . STO
* Here are a few facts and figures I've assembled . STO
* Can't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged . STO
* `` Well '' , he said , `` there is Freddy , you know . STO
* And _RARE_ . STO
* Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already . STO
* He _RARE_ me he has people to handle the money raising , and _RARE_ Richert , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of Zenith and _RARE_ are no problem . STO
* I don't like to exhibit the deadly _RARE_ effect of an elderly man's caution '' . STO
* `` Yes , I appreciate that . STO
* I wish you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm _RARE_ ; ; I've caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to _RARE_ me . STO
* If we don't take care , the sisters will be entering the _RARE_ on opposite sides , _RARE_ their _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Which is a _RARE_ prospect , Bill '' . STO
* Willis laughed . STO
* `` One shouldn't _RARE_ commercial affairs with _RARE_ , but in this case I have no choice . STO
* Let me think about it . STO
* I'm most grateful to you , so grateful I wish you were my principal _RARE_ instead of Freddy '' . STO
* Not to _RARE_ surprise , Freddy , Adam and _RARE_ Richert _RARE_ ; ; allied to them was _RARE_ , devoting much time to _RARE_ her father , and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William was _RARE_ to interfere further . STO
* Zenith absorbed _RARE_ , stock transfers were arranged , and Freddy became president of the _RARE_ combination . STO
* Through Jack Hamrick , William fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for _RARE_ and Clay . STO
* He forgot about A-Z till , _RARE_ , he and Hamrick were proved correct . STO
* _RARE_ backing dropped away from him and Mr. Willis was forced to make up the _RARE_ . STO
* Adam , _RARE_ by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn't deliver from his end . STO
* The Wisconsin plant turned out to be a white _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ Willis held in _RARE_ fell sharply in value . STO
* _RARE_ by a grim future , Freddy lost his nerve and _RARE_ for a _RARE_ liquidation . STO
* Once more Willis summoned William . STO
* `` You were right '' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and I'm in something of a _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ solution doesn't appeal to me . STO
* In addition to other _RARE_ , I'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment . STO
* Will you see if you can help me '' ? STO
* William spent a long week end _RARE_ with Hamrick . STO
* His recent experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of _RARE_ useless Wisconsin _RARE_ , exposure to exciting conceptions of _RARE_ that nobody would buy , and the _RARE_ recent failure of a respected but _RARE_ _RARE_ manufacturer called _RARE_ Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to _RARE_ it . STO
* Initially , _RARE_ reaction to A-Z going into the passenger car market was _RARE_ . STO
* He thought the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a _RARE_ chain of _RARE_ was simply too difficult . STO
* Then he caught fire . STO
* If A-Z could buy _RARE_ _RARE_ and use their _RARE_ and _RARE_ and other equipment , if William could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money _RARE_ was not _RARE_ . STO
* They took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white . STO
* _RARE_ Hamrick with him , William went to Mr. Willis . STO
* He was surprised and _RARE_ , but impressed by the engineer and the report . STO
* `` Your alternative is _RARE_ '' , he said , `` and , I'm _RARE_ in saying , a bit mad . STO
* I wish I was younger and less _RARE_ . STO
* Well , I can't resolve this myself . STO
* I'll have to call in the brain trust . STO
* Are you willing to run the _RARE_ ? STO
* I can't guarantee you a sympathetic audience '' . STO
* `` We'll be in there swinging '' , William said , `` but in a way , sir , you've got to decide it yourself . STO
* You have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage . STO
* If they follow anyone , it'll have to be you '' . STO
* He paused . STO
* `` I should explain : there's more here for me than _RARE_ my little dream , there's you . STO
* You mustn't take a fall , or publicly back away . STO
* I hate that . STO
* You're -- you're Arthur Willis . STO
* _RARE_ the hearts and flowers theme '' . STO
* `` I rather like the music '' , Willis replied quietly . STO
* `` Thank you '' . STO
* At the meeting , attended by Freddy , Richert , _RARE_ and the A-Z executive staff , with Mr. Willis _RARE_ , William and Hamrick did indeed run the _RARE_ . STO
* From shock and _RARE_ , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and _RARE_ . STO
* `` Oh , my God '' , _RARE_ Richert said , `` a little child shall lead them . STO
* _RARE_ over , General Motors '' . STO
* `` It's absurd , Bill '' , Freddy said , from a pale face . STO
* `` You're leading Dad down the garden path '' . STO
* `` Your garden , God damn it '' ! STO
* William said . STO
* `` I don't enjoy family _RARE_ '' , Adam said . STO
* `` Nor crazy relatives . STO
* We're here to _RARE_ business . STO
* Can't we put an end to this , Arthur '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ me out , please '' , William begged . STO
* `` I'm an advertising _RARE_ , I admit , but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere . STO
* Sure , _RARE_ went broke in the _RARE_ market _RARE_ the Big Three . STO
* Their cars weren't small enough , they didn't have the power , they were _RARE_ . STO
* They tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit . STO
* We've arrived at an age for romance and _RARE_ . STO
* We've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age . STO
* Look what those little European jobs are doing . STO
* We'll _RARE_ the consumer with a product , not _RARE_ him with _RARE_ excess length and weight . STO
* Let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a _RARE_ , at reasonable rates . STO
* _RARE_ folded a few minutes too soon , before the _RARE_ changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of _RARE_ the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , _RARE_ . STO
* We've got rid of the steam _RARE_ and _RARE_ houses , and the _RARE_ , _RARE_ automobile is next . STO
* Why not come down _RARE_ in the world , in a _RARE_ fashion , with an _RARE_ '' ? STO
* He swayed them somewhat , but the debate raged on . STO
* _RARE_ emerged as the main obstacle . STO
* Mr. Willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum . STO
* `` Nobody will _RARE_ it , I'm telling you '' , Freddy said . STO
* `` I know what I'm talking about in that department '' . STO
* `` There's plenty of risk money '' , _RARE_ Richert added , `` but not for anything this _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` All right '' , William said . STO
* `` We'll try to swing the deal on that basis . STO
* If we can't raise the capital , we're through . STO
* Nothing has been lost . STO
* You're up against it anyhow . STO
* Why won't you give me a chance '' ? STO
* A silence fell . STO
* _RARE_ instinctively turned in _RARE_ direction . STO
* He smiled at William and slowly rubbed his hands together . STO
* `` I feel I must answer the question '' , he said , `` since the _RARE_ later , if any , should fall on me -- I don't _RARE_ _RARE_ spread broadcast outside my family . STO
* I'm not giving you a chance , Bill , but _RARE_ myself of your generous offer of assistance . STO
* Good luck to you '' . STO
* `` All the _RARE_ have got to have their day '' , Adam said , and _RARE_ at William and Freddy in turn . STO
* _RARE_ started out on _RARE_ forehead , whether from relief or _RARE_ he could not tell . STO
* _RARE_ the table , Hamrick _RARE_ him _RARE_ with an _RARE_ thumb and forefinger . STO
* Nobody else showed pleasure . STO
* _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ with _RARE_ glasses and an _RARE_ League suit , Jack Hamrick _RARE_ William at the _RARE_ club . STO
* `` Hello , boss '' , he said , and grinned . STO
* `` I suppose I can never expect to call you ' General ' after that Washington _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I'm afraid not '' . STO
* It was among these that _RARE_ identified a photograph of Barco ! STO
* For it seems that Barco , _RARE_ himself a ladies' man ( and why not , after seven marriages ? STO
* ) , had listed himself for _RARE_ _RARE_ roles at the _RARE_ of his fourth murder victim who had said : `` With your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies '' ! STO
* Mills secured Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of _RARE_ Barco . STO
* On their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main _RARE_ to question the _RARE_ . STO
* Finally , at _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ on _RARE_ Avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to San Diego . STO
* They headed in that direction and , at San Juan _RARE_ _RARE_ came upon Barco sitting in the quaint old Spanish Mission _RARE_ , eating a hot _RARE_ . STO
* At the moment , Barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his _RARE_ which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search . STO
* The _RARE_ , however , was missing , for by that time Barco had _RARE_ of it at a _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* The detectives placed Barco under arrest and , without _RARE_ him of the nature of the charge , took him back to Hollywood for questioning . STO
* Thus it was that Barco , _RARE_ for mere _RARE_ , now began to suspect that one or another of his _RARE_ had been _RARE_ . STO
* During the return trip , Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as : `` They're under sand _RARE_ They're better off , I tell you I saved their souls '' . STO
* The detective , _RARE_ on Barco's behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the _RARE_ citizens of our community who are mentally _RARE_ -- that he was a more or less _RARE_ `` nut '' ! STO
* However while in his cell _RARE_ trial for theft , Barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life . STO
* The attempt had failed because , when _RARE_ to cut his wrists , this murderer of seven women had _RARE_ at the sight of blood . STO
* The jail authorities -- _RARE_ no particular significance to the _RARE_ -- offered Barco whisky to _RARE_ him ; ; but the old fellow , a _RARE_ _RARE_ , refused it , and no more was thought of the matter . STO
* Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case . STO
* A man of _RARE_ ambition , with one eye on the _RARE_ of Los Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity . STO
* It was reported to Welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide . STO
* Welch wanted to know why . STO
* No one knew . STO
* Now Welch had a _RARE_ theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at . STO
* The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test . STO
* So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their _RARE_ by stating _RARE_ : `` Barco , we've got the goods on you ! STO
* It'll be a lot better if you come clean '' . STO
* At first Barco was _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* But with Welch's _RARE_ pursuit of the subject , Barco finally `` broke '' and started _RARE_ to one murder after another . STO
* By the time Barco reached the count of three , the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true . STO
* But if true , it was the case of which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into _RARE_ all over America as the hero of a great murder trial . STO
* Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell . STO
* But to Welch's _RARE_ , the police captain _RARE_ Welch's _RARE_ in Barco's confession . STO
* Barco was clearly a `` nut '' . STO
* It required strength , _RARE_ , _RARE_ to commit murder . STO
* `` That _RARE_ a murderer ? STO
* _RARE_ '' ! STO
* Then , for the first time since his arrest , a _RARE_ of spirit lit Barco's eyes . STO
* His manhood had been attacked . STO
* He stiffened and rose to his feet . STO
* He'd show them ! STO
* `` Is that so '' ? STO
* He _RARE_ . STO
* `` Well , for ten years I've been _RARE_ women . STO
* I can lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ain't four , nor five , nor six of 'em -- there's seven ! STO
* '' The next day the police captain , in _RARE_ , organized what he termed `` Welch's _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* For indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on _RARE_ murder for ten years and not get caught at it , even in Hollywood . STO
* The searching party consisted of the police captain , Welch , Barco , _RARE_ with _RARE_ , newspaper reporters , and _RARE_ . STO
* Barco , his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a _RARE_ which remained his principal attitude from that time on . STO
* He directed the _RARE_ of _RARE_ to the sand _RARE_ near _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two _RARE_ sand hills , and indicated a location . STO
* _RARE_ were given to dig . STO
* Nothing was found . STO
* Welch was worried . STO
* The police captain _RARE_ . STO
* The newspaper boys cracked jokes and again Barco's pride was aroused . STO
* With greater precision he again paced off a location , this time a little more to the left . STO
* With _RARE_ and _RARE_ , the _RARE_ again started _RARE_ . STO
* Welch was on edge . STO
* The captain was _RARE_ that it was a nice day for a _RARE_ when finally one of the _RARE_ struck an object . STO
* `` There's something here '' ! STO
* Said the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ stopped and everyone gathered around . STO
* The _RARE_ , thrusting about with his shovel , now raised into view a package _RARE_ wrapped in one of the _RARE_ Hollywood _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Although it was a mere _RARE_ of the _RARE_ remains , it was enough . STO
* Welch was wild with delight . STO
* His _RARE_ grew as Barco's seven _RARE_ brought to light one reward after another . STO
* Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him . STO
* It went to his head , and his ambition increased . STO
* It was apparent that Welch was in _RARE_ with Marshall and would use his power as _RARE_ to drag every possible sensation into the case . STO
* Every new scandal which would provide more `` copy '' for _RARE_ pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch . STO
* I knew that both these _RARE_ were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand . STO
* Once there , the _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ would provide Marshall with _RARE_ : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' `` Viola Lake an _RARE_ '' `` _RARE_ of Another _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* It would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the _RARE_ _RARE_ over the broken reputation of a helpless girl ! STO
* I studied Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be _RARE_ . STO
* It wasn't long before I sensed that there was something deeper than _RARE_ ambition back of his desire for _RARE_ destruction . STO
* He was bitter and _RARE_ toward her , personally _RARE_ . STO
* A _RARE_ fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had _RARE_ _RARE_ toward _RARE_ favors -- or , even more serious perhaps , that he had _RARE_ a share of them and had then been _RARE_ by some _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I did not rest until I had _RARE_ the mystery down . STO
* Well , here it is . STO
* One day over a year before , there had been a _RARE_ party in an apartment of a downtown hotel . STO
* Viola had been urged to attend , by telephone , and not knowing the host or the character of the party , she had gone . STO
* She arrived late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority ; ; the air was thick with smoke , empty bottles were in evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor . STO
* _RARE_ , Viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival , in all _RARE_ to her host . STO
* And it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken _RARE_ was a small table on which she noted a _RARE_ of red _RARE_ ; ; while _RARE_ from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as _RARE_ would have it , belonged to District Attorney Welch . STO
* As Viola sat there , a _RARE_ impulse _RARE_ her to remove the shoes and socks from the _RARE_ feet and , as a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ between the toes . STO
* A little later the district attorney woke up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the _RARE_ _RARE_ on `` The _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ '' , in the _RARE_ room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the _RARE_ , was to _RARE_ . STO
* He made his way to his _RARE_ bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off , neatly arranged his hair , and _RARE_ selected his hat from the many on the bed . STO
* Then , _RARE_ neither the absence of his _RARE_ nor the presence of the _RARE_ , he made his way to the _RARE_ room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the _RARE_ . STO
* The effect on the _RARE_ among his audience may well be imagined . STO
* The incident , aside from reflecting on Welch's political career , had all but _RARE_ his home life . STO
* He never rested until he discovered who the _RARE_ was , and when he did , he _RARE_ _RARE_ on Viola Lake if ever the chance came his way . STO
* And here it was ! STO
* By such innocent actions are human _RARE_ sometimes set in motion . STO
* During these first days of the trial I didn't have as much time to _RARE_ with Viola as I should have liked . STO
* In the first place , it was difficult for us to meet . STO
* We couldn't be seen together , for the tongue of _RARE_ was ever ready to link our names , and the tongue of _RARE_ finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no matter how innocent . STO
* I couldn't _RARE_ Viola to our house , for Mother _RARE_ refused to receive her . STO
* Now the _RARE_ had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had _RARE_ a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los _RARE_ Society to her . STO
* There , Mother was received by the _RARE_ of _RARE_ lines which are dominated by the _RARE_ ( of beer _RARE_ ) , the _RARE_ ( of _RARE_ origin ) , and the _RARE_ ( whose _RARE_ _RARE_ a _RARE_ famous trade in _RARE_ ) . STO
* I hated being dragged into the _RARE_ of these _RARE_ . STO
* But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone _RARE_ connected with the _RARE_ is ever received in their exclusive _RARE_ . STO
* In fact , it was not until the King of _RARE_ had visited at _RARE_ that Mary and _RARE_ were _RARE_ to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and _RARE_ from the _RARE_ . STO
* Mother even went so far as to _RARE_ up for me _RARE_ opportunities with _RARE_ _RARE_ who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more _RARE_ Los Angeles area where a _RARE_ was a girl who had been to high school . STO
* But at long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` _RARE_ '' in order to spend a _RARE_ evening with Viola and her _RARE_ at her home . STO
* However , such a _RARE_ of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , _RARE_ , to my own mother . STO
* When I arrived at _RARE_ I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen . STO
* Viola greeted me , in checked apron , _RARE_ in hand , and explained it was the _RARE_ night out and that she herself was preparing dinner . STO
* I sat and watched proceedings . STO
* There was to be _RARE_ chicken with dressing , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , new _RARE_ with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ potatoes -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by Viola herself . STO
* I realized that _RARE_ was faced with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have been no greater . STO
* The most that was accomplished was adding Mrs. _RARE_ tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an _RARE_ scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after a fashion . STO
* I was saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly . STO
* Here's a household hint : if you can't find your children , and get tired of calling them , pick up the phone . STO
* No matter if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting their _RARE_ , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you _RARE_ within seconds after you pick up the phone . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ themselves around me , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency . STO
* Somehow _RARE_ to get out a cool , poised , `` _RARE_ you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less _RARE_ , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including _RARE_ Island and the _RARE_ reaches of _RARE_ . STO
* I promised to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed . STO
* _RARE_ into the phone again and _RARE_ the _RARE_ , I resumed my everyday voice . STO
* Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like _RARE_ holding her breath and pretending to black out , _RARE_ _RARE_ the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ . STO
* Under the circumstances , I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone , but when I hung up I was reasonably certain that Francesca had wanted to _RARE_ me of our town meeting the next evening , and how important it was that Hank and I be there . STO
* I discovered that the girls had _RARE_ _RARE_ the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room . STO
* It seemed that I would be the _RARE_ if I accepted the peace and quiet , instead of carrying out my threats . STO
* _RARE_ to get something done , I started in on the dishes . STO
* No . STO
* I'm not saying it right . STO
* What I meant to say was that I started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink . STO
* They looked so _RARE_ , however , so demanding , that I found myself staring at them in _RARE_ and starting to _RARE_ again , this time about Francesca and her husband . STO
* How about them , I thought . STO
* Francesca and Herbert were among the few people we knew in Catatonia . STO
* We didn't even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time , they had called on us , after I met _RARE_ at a _RARE_ meeting , and had taken us in hand socially . STO
* They had been kind to us and we were _RARE_ to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since Catatonia was just a village ; ; the yellow pages of the telephone book were _RARE_ thin ) . STO
* They were `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ , an expert on narrow ties , thin _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , was men's fashion editor of _RARE_ , the weekly magazine with the tremendous _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and he had met about two years after she had arrived in Manhattan from _RARE_ , or was it Wyoming ? STO
* She was the daughter and sole _RARE_ of either a cattle _RARE_ or an oil _RARE_ and , having arrived in New York with a big bank roll , became a _RARE_ in various fields . STO
* She _RARE_ _RARE_ Village artists for _RARE_ , then put some money into a Broadway show which was successful ( terrible , but successful ) . STO
* It was during her `` writing '' period that she and _RARE_ met and decided that they were in love . STO
* They were married at a _RARE_ ceremony which was duly recorded in _RARE_ and all other magazines and newspapers , and then they _RARE_ in Bermuda . STO
* No , not Bermuda . STO
* Bermuda was not in style that year . STO
* They had _RARE_ in Rome ; ; everyone was very high on Rome that year . STO
* They had bought their house in Catatonia after _RARE_ all the regions of _RARE_ surrounding New York ; ; they had chosen Catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ of names . STO
* `` You are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , _RARE_ had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just _RARE_ little _RARE_ and dull _RARE_ , but People Who Do _RARE_ '' . STO
* I admired their easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape an _RARE_ at their way of always doing the right things . STO
* Their house was a _RARE_ _RARE_ which they had had restored ( guided by an _RARE_ _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ , and added on to . STO
* It had a _RARE_ corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a _RARE_ room , a dining room , a sitting room , a room for standing up , a party room , dressing rooms for everybody , even a room for mud . STO
* It was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the _RARE_ room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time . STO
* Their two boys were `` well adjusted '' and , like their parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences . STO
* Francesca and Herbert considered themselves violently _RARE_ and showed the world they were by filling their _RARE_ house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ) . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ her independence by _RARE_ against the Catatonia uniform of Bermuda shorts and _RARE_ socks by wearing Bermuda shorts and _RARE_ socks in colors ; ; bright _RARE_ and _RARE_ and vivid _RARE_ . STO
* Sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid , _RARE_ black , and with her blonde hair cut so closely , wearing this uniform , she strongly resembled a member of the _RARE_ . STO
* No one could dislike them , I thought . STO
* Sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human . STO
* It seemed , indeed , that their house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles _RARE_ , with nice _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names '' ; ; even brand names . STO
* You should hear the _RARE_ in _RARE_ voice when she said `` _RARE_ '' or `` _RARE_ '' or `` Madame Alexander '' . STO
* She always let it be known that there was wine in the pot _RARE_ or that the chicken had been _RARE_ in brandy , and that _RARE_ second cousin was an intimate of theirs . STO
* I wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of Catatonia were equally _RARE_ . STO
* I couldn't feel at home among them . STO
* Besides Francesca , there was Blanche . STO
* Francesca was pleasant and charming , but Blanche was sweet . STO
* Yes , Blanche was very , very sweet -- being in her company was like being _RARE_ in warm , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* I had once been a witness when Blanche had smiled and said with only minimum _RARE_ , `` Oh , my _RARE_ has collapsed '' . STO
* _RARE_ knows how a real , _RARE_ woman would react to such a catastrophe ! STO
* If Blanche had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at least a couple of doors , and thrown a few little , _RARE_ things . STO
* But dear me , no ; ; not Blanche . STO
* After five minutes with Blanche , one might welcome the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , who was a sort of _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Francesca and _RARE_ were _RARE_ committee _RARE_ and they usually managed to be elected _RARE_ , equal _RARE_ , of whatever _RARE_ or civic project was being launched . STO
* They were _RARE_ , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other , as they were keen _RARE_ for social leadership . STO
* _RARE_ was mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive . STO
* _RARE_ had a small , slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast . STO
* She lived in an _RARE_ house whose decoration , _RARE_ , paint , and even _RARE_ were chosen to complement her _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ were a couple of _RARE_ cats . STO
* Her uniform was of rich , raw silk , in a shade which matched her hair , skin , _RARE_ , and cats , and since she was so thin as to be almost _RARE_ , she rather resembled a frozen fish stick . STO
* The _RARE_ of these women and others I had met in Catatonia were distinguished only in that they were , to me at least , _RARE_ . STO
* I couldn't tell one from the other . STO
* Like Herbert , they were all in communications : radio , television , magazines , and advertising . STO
* One or two were writers of books ; ; all were fellows of finite charm . STO
* Each had developed a _RARE_ _RARE_ and the habit of saying `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* In _RARE_ to _RARE_ . STO
* I never thought I'd live to hear people _RARE_ and say `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* In real life . STO
* I wouldn't have missed it for anything . STO
* They were `` sincere '' -- men of the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the urgent smile . STO
* These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they gazed , _RARE_ with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting . STO
* Could such _RARE_ love , for a total stranger , be credited ? STO
* They were always _RARE_ to light cigarettes , open car doors , fill plates or glasses , and I _RARE_ the whole lot of them to the same degree that I _RARE_ _RARE_ shops that called themselves `` _RARE_ Bake _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` O ! STO
* _RARE_ ! STO
* '' I thought , and wondered what kind of _RARE_ such odd _RARE_ would establish in this suburban _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ who looked like _RARE_ _RARE_ even at _RARE_ conferences and who never called the school principal `` Mister '' . STO
* I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` _RARE_ to _RARE_ '' ; ; people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; who were more _RARE_ than _RARE_ , more _RARE_ than persons . STO
* In my _RARE_ , they were people who read _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and discussed Kafka ; ; well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! STO
* _RARE_ and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka . STO
* They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were . STO
* _RARE_ aware that it was nearly _RARE_ , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand . STO
* I made plans for the afternoon -- doing the breakfast and _RARE_ dishes all at once , making the beds , and then maybe painting the kitchen . STO
* Then , I remembered that the girls had had a _RARE_ for dessert every day for the last week . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* _RARE_ had shouted each time . STO
* `` They're not dessert ! STO
* They're not even food . STO
* They're just something you're supposed to put on _RARE_ for breakfast '' . STO
* I dug around and found a _RARE_ , and was able to surprise them with a _RARE_ cake with _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* ( Sometimes I think you need only one rule for cooking : if you can't put _RARE_ in it , put _RARE_ in it . STO
* ) The cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the _RARE_ of taste _RARE_ Mama had been providing . STO
* Then _RARE_ closed her eyes , stretched forth her arms , and said : `` Take my hand , _RARE_ ; ; I'm a stranger in _RARE_ '' . STO
* Needless to say , I was _RARE_ at this _RARE_ _RARE_ upon free enterprise . STO
* How dared they demand to `` _RARE_ '' in private financial records , _RARE_ , _RARE_ contracts and agreements ? STO
* `` It is as though '' , I said on the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ radio broadcast which I bought ( following Father Coughlin and _RARE_ the Eddie _RARE_ , Manhattan _RARE_ and Major _RARE_ shows ) `` That Man in the White House , like some _RARE_ of _RARE_ , insisted on reading my _RARE_ , _RARE_ my _RARE_ and _RARE_ my _RARE_ ! STO
* '' My _RARE_ _RARE_ for civil rights created a _RARE_ of correspondence and one _RARE_ even asked me to consider _RARE_ the Eddie _RARE_ comedy hour on a permanent basis . STO
* But what quarter could a poor _RARE_ woman expect from a _RARE_ who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation ? STO
* The savage _RARE_ _RARE_ of red Russian _RARE_ descended on the _RARE_ that was mighty _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ with their _RARE_ battle cry of `` _RARE_ the rich ' ! STO
* After an _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio `` owed '' the government a tax _RARE_ in excess of eight million dollars while I , who had always remained _RARE_ from such _RARE_ practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned and the little I _RARE_ inherited as _RARE_ helpless _RARE_ , was `` _RARE_ '' with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to `` wipe out '' all but a fraction of my poor , _RARE_ savings . STO
* I was also publicly _RARE_ , dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such _RARE_ publications as The New Republic , The New _RARE_ , Time and The Christian Science _RARE_ . STO
* It was then that I _RARE_ myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax _RARE_ . STO
* The litigation was _RARE_ and seemingly endless . STO
* I fought like a _RARE_ but by the time I _RARE_ my case to the Supreme Court ( _RARE_ ) , Mr. Roosevelt and his `` _RARE_ '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest _RARE_ in the land in order to _RARE_ little me . STO
* Presidential _RARE_ had succeeded not only in _RARE_ the _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ '' and _RARE_ of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so _RARE_ as to _RARE_ any lawyer in the nation from representing me ! STO
* I was ready , like _RARE_ , to present my own brief . STO
* But the Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case ! STO
* My _RARE_ was _RARE_ voted down and `` thrown out '' . STO
* Again , my name was on all the front pages . STO
* I was , it seemed , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in every quarter , but not entirely without a _RARE_ following of noted political _RARE_ and students of _RARE_ . STO
* As Charles Evans _RARE_ said , `` Miss _RARE_ limitations as an _RARE_ are _RARE_ only by her logic as a _RARE_ '' . STO
* Albert _RARE_ was quoted as saying : `` The _RARE_ of the woman's mind _RARE_ me '' . STO
* Henry Ford spoke of me as `` utterly _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ wrote : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ is the most original _RARE_ since _RARE_ '' , and even _RARE_ had to _RARE_ that `` if the rest of this nation showed the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of Miss _RARE_ , America would rapidly _RARE_ ancient _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' . STO
* Not only were the court costs _RARE_ , but I was subjected to _RARE_ _RARE_ , in addition to _RARE_ interest on the unpaid `` _RARE_ '' which the government claimed that _RARE_ and I owed -- a severe financial blow . STO
* Nor , as _RARE_ said , had the _RARE_ done my career `` any good '' . STO
* My enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary '' , `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , and even `` _RARE_ '' ! STO
* _RARE_ indeed ! STO
* I point now with pride to the fact that , long _RARE_ the Committee on _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the Economic Council and other such _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' organizations were so much as heard of , I was _RARE_ leading _RARE_ against communism , fighting _RARE_ `` creeping _RARE_ '' against such _RARE_ odds as the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and an army of more than _RARE_ million _RARE_ whom _RARE_ employed _RARE_ , through the _RARE_ _RARE_ of regular `` relief '' checks . STO
* Needless to say , my art suffered _RARE_ during this _RARE_ period . STO
* Could it do otherwise ? STO
* Even though I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no _RARE_ can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her _RARE_ , her home and her nation itself are all _RARE_ . STO
* Such _RARE_ _RARE_ are hardly _RARE_ to `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ performances . STO
* I tried my hardest , with little help , may I say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe . STO
* Having ( through my _RARE_ effort and devotion ) achieved _RARE_ , a fortune and a _RARE_ wife at an age when most young men are _RARE_ their first vote , Letch proceeded to neglect them all . STO
* Never a `` quick study '' , he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines '' and many a mile of film was wasted , many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow _RARE_ -- was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ and `` _RARE_ '' had never learned his part . STO
* Each time Letch `` went up '' in his `` lines '' , I was the one to be patient , helpful and _RARE_ while he _RARE_ in outbursts of _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ others , going into `` _RARE_ '' and , on more occasions than I care to count , _RARE_ off the `` set '' for the rest of the day . STO
* As for his _RARE_ , I was never _RARE_ to know exactly how much money Letch had `` _RARE_ away '' . STO
* It was I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even _RARE_ bills at his _RARE_ and the Los Angeles _RARE_ Club . STO
* Never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a _RARE_ jaw . STO
* ( But that is another story . STO
* ) As for his private _RARE_ , they were rapidly _RARE_ in drinking , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* More than once I was confronted by professional _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ '' , loan `` _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to _RARE_ my husband's _RARE_ losses , `` or else '' I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even _RARE_ with such a sinister _RARE_ . STO
* And at three different times during our _RARE_ marriage strange girls , with the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had _RARE_ their _RARE_ children ! STO
* Having the deepest of _RARE_ _RARE_ , my heart fairly _RARE_ when I thought of the darling pink and white `` _RARE_ from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband . STO
* `` Ah , you're too old '' , was invariably his _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' . STO
* Letch had made it _RARE_ clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter . STO
* I now felt it wiser to keep _RARE_ in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of _RARE_ all year around . STO
* Her presence only made Letch more distant and _RARE_ and , in the hurry of buying _RARE_ _RARE_ , I had neglected to consider a room for _RARE_ , so there was no place to put her , anyhow . STO
* ( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these _RARE_ little _RARE_ of memory . STO
* It almost always works out for the best . STO
* ) Yet I _RARE_ this man , Letch _RARE_ , why , I cannot say . STO
* With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ , his _RARE_ , his indifference , his _RARE_ and his _RARE_ . STO
* The times I can recall when I was publicly _RARE_ by him -- lovely dinner parties in our _RARE_ _RARE_ where the _RARE_ was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and _RARE_ at a table where the _RARE_ chair was vacant ; ; a `` _RARE_ party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public _RARE_ , when Letch and a certain _RARE_ stayed _RARE_ together for the better part of an hour ; ; a lovely _RARE_ party at _RARE_ _RARE_ , on which sacred occasion Letch _RARE_ away with an unknown `` _RARE_ '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best I could . STO
* These are but a sampling of the _RARE_ I endured . STO
* As Mrs. Letch _RARE_ , was it any wonder that I , once the social _RARE_ of _RARE_ , was excluded from the smart _RARE_ given by the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ and such _RARE_ , closely _RARE_ families as the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ ? STO
* As _RARE_ _RARE_ conduct increased , our _RARE_ decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' gathering . STO
* Between _RARE_ and _RARE_ Letch and I made ten films together , each less successful , both _RARE_ and commercially , than the one before it . STO
* Our last joint venture , _RARE_ Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother _RARE_ , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the _RARE_ of _RARE_ first saint in November , _RARE_ , was a _RARE_ from start to finish . STO
* As I was playing Mother _RARE_ , the picture was actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene built around me . STO
* But in order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a _RARE_ _RARE_ who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the _RARE_ example of Mother _RARE_ . STO
* And did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ? STO
* Did he trouble to _RARE_ the very small part which I had `` _RARE_ '' to his _RARE_ , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches ? STO
* Did he show the rest of the cast -- _RARE_ four thousand -- the consideration of arriving at the studio _RARE_ -- or even at all ? STO
* He did not ! STO
* The `` shooting '' went on for eight months ! STO
* Most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ gambling _RARE_ , a certain `` residential club for young _RARE_ '' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club . STO
* Whenever he _RARE_ to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* He made many _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general . STO
* By the time the film was released we were three million dollars _RARE_ , war was _RARE_ and the public apparently had forgotten all about Mother _RARE_ . STO
* Thanks to Letch _RARE_ and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and _RARE_ . STO
* Only George _RARE_ seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` Miss _RARE_ has _RARE_ the most _RARE_ argument for the _RARE_ faith yet _RARE_ by Hollywood '' . STO
* But it was small _RARE_ . STO
* In a rare fit of anger and spite , I `` _RARE_ out '' my own husband to a small and most _RARE_ studio to make one picture as a form of punishment . STO
* ( An actor must have discipline . STO
* ) The film was called The _RARE_ of _RARE_ , which I felt was just what Letch deserved . STO
* It turned out to be a life of Martin _RARE_ , of all things ! STO
* It was a _RARE_ ! STO
* In clothes , Letch simply did not project . STO
* He was laughed off the screen . STO
* At the same time , however , I _RARE_ myself of the services of that great English actor and master of _RARE_ , Sir _RARE_ _RARE_ , to do a `` _RARE_ '' called The _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , in which I played a young American girl who _RARE_ a haunted _RARE_ on the English _RARE_ which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , _RARE_ to anyone , is still occupied by an _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It was a `` _RARE_ '' made on a `` _RARE_ '' and not the sort of film I like , as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal . STO
* My heart was not in it , but , oddly enough , it remains the most _RARE_ successful picture of my career . STO
* ( I watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later . STO
* ) Letch had returned from his _RARE_ _RARE_ and more badly behaved than before . STO
* I really loved that boy , and , in a _RARE_ attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to _RARE_ the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to _RARE_ , hoping that her _RARE_ advice would help me . STO
* `` If I could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his _RARE_ energy '' , I said . STO
* `` What is Letch interested in '' ? STO
* `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ said _RARE_ . STO
* Her reply _RARE_ me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference . STO
* `` I can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon '' , I said . STO
* Up to date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it . STO
* It wasn't his fault that these things were so . STO
* The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its _RARE_ of details which must be cleaned up immediately . STO
* As a result , life had become a kind of continuous _RARE_ . STO
* Once he _RARE_ of these items which screamed so _RARE_ for attention , he could _RARE_ the things which really counted . STO
* Then , at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just _RARE_ through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs . STO
* His dogs ? STO
* He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams . STO
* Then they had always been _RARE_ around him on these _RARE_ , _RARE_ with delight , _RARE_ off into the bushes on _RARE_ hunting _RARE_ , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ did something to one's ego . STO
* They were constantly _RARE_ you that you were one of the world's great guys . STO
* _RARE_ of how much of a _RARE_ you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference . STO
* Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture . STO
* What in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons ? STO
* You certainly couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous _RARE_ . STO
* Why in the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ? STO
* It worried him , this inability to get the _RARE_ things done in the course of a day . STO
* He would wake up in the middle of the night and _RARE_ about it . STO
* How in the world had he _RARE_ found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a _RARE_ brief case ? STO
* Was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? STO
* Could it be that it _RARE_ up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a _RARE_ universe were _RARE_ through the end of the chapter just to get it over with ? STO
* Or was the answer less metaphysical ? STO
* Did older people work more slowly ? STO
* Did it take a man of _RARE_ longer to write a letter , _RARE_ , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? STO
* Did men become _RARE_ as they grew older , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , reluctant to let go ? STO
* It might be that certain people were born with a _RARE_ to _RARE_ their lives , while others could live _RARE_ motionless almost indefinitely , like _RARE_ in the sun , too _RARE_ to _RARE_ their eyes . STO
* Perhaps it was his _RARE_ , or good fortune , _RARE_ way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively _RARE_ to it . STO
* And then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after _RARE_ : reading , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn't want to do them . STO
* There was no _RARE_ behind them . STO
* They could be done or left _RARE_ and nobody really gave a damn . STO
* During all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done . STO
* This habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed _RARE_ to do anything for which no one was waiting . STO
* He looked at the luminous _RARE_ of his wrist watch . STO
* It was five minutes after four . STO
* On some distant farm a _RARE_ _RARE_ and , far down the valley , an _RARE_ answered . STO
* He turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the dawn . STO
* At least he could buy the equipment for his workshop . STO
* Thus committed , action might follow . STO
* He went down to Mills and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and bought a full set of _RARE_ tools , including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr. Mills said were essential for _RARE_ and _RARE_ , whatever they were . STO
* He also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ nails , levels and T squares and plumb lines and several _RARE_ that he had no idea how to use or what they were for . STO
* `` There '' , said Mr. Mills . STO
* `` That'll get you started . STO
* _RARE_ not to get everything at once . STO
* _RARE_ things as you find you need 'em '' . STO
* He didn't even ask the cost of this collection . STO
* After all , if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that . STO
* When he returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , _RARE_ had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car . STO
* He was glad . STO
* It gave him a chance to _RARE_ the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a _RARE_ of acid comments . STO
* He had made such a _RARE_ about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable . STO
* He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall . STO
* That was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools . STO
* In front of it would be his workbench . STO
* The old nightmare which had caused him so many _RARE_ hours came charging in on him once more , only this time he couldn't _RARE_ it with a sleeping pill and send it away . STO
* How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? STO
* How did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ? STO
* After the pegboard there would be the _RARE_ . STO
* He sat down on an old box and focused on the problem . STO
* Perhaps one _RARE_ holes in the stone with some kind of an electric _RARE_ . STO
* But then , when you stuck things into the holes , why didn't they come right out again ? STO
* It all seemed rather _RARE_ . STO
* He turned his attention to the workbench . STO
* Perhaps that was the first thing to do . STO
* A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't _RARE_ like a _RARE_ _RARE_ and ultimately _RARE_ when you leaned on it ? STO
* Mr. Mills had done some _RARE_ on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and _RARE_ which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench . STO
* They lay on the cellar floor in a _RARE_ pile . STO
* Mr. Crombie _RARE_ at it _RARE_ with his foot . STO
* How could anyone know what to do with an _RARE_ like that ? STO
* Perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench -- someone who knew what he was about . STO
* Then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on . STO
* After that everything should be simpler . STO
* He went upstairs to phone _RARE_ . STO
* To his amazement he reached him . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ was laid up with a bad cold . STO
* He didn't seem to think that _RARE_ a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the _RARE_ equally lightly . STO
* The only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job . STO
* That was why he hadn't been able to finish the porch . STO
* No , he didn't know of any _RARE_ . STO
* There wasn't any such thing any more . STO
* _RARE_ all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job . STO
* There was a fellow named Blatz over _RARE_ way . STO
* Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk . STO
* Mr. _RARE_ would probably see him at _RARE_ _RARE_ the next night . STO
* If he was sober , which was doubtful , he'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie . STO
* Mr. Blatz had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest _RARE_ that had come into Mr. _RARE_ life since he moved to _RARE_ , in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time , and he didn't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked to him . STO
* He said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you . STO
* So Mr. Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr. _RARE_ mind from funny things . STO
* At the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached _RARE_ to stone walls , but Mr. Blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance . STO
* While Mr. Blatz was putting up the _RARE_ and starting the workbench , Mr. Crombie told him of this idea about _RARE_ the whole end of the cellar . STO
* Mr. Blatz agreed that this would be pretty . STO
* Without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the _RARE_ , which he then stained and _RARE_ according to his taste . STO
* `` Now '' , he said , `` we got to put in some _RARE_ for them power tools ; ; then a couple of _RARE_ lamps over the workbench an' I guess we're about through down here '' . STO
* It all did look very efficient and _RARE_ . STO
* There was no question of that . STO
* `` By the way '' , said Mr. Blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , `` them power tools needs extra voltage . STO
* I guess you know about that . STO
* Before you use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new _RARE_ box for the extra _RARE_ . STO
* That ain't too bad _RARE_ the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do _RARE_ '' . STO
* Instead of being depressed by this news , Mr. Crombie was actually relieved . STO
* At least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools . STO
* He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs . STO
* As usual , Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking _RARE_ . STO
* Mr. Blatz sat down in the only _RARE_ kitchen chair . STO
* `` Well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there . STO
* He _RARE_ be able to build a new house with all them _RARE_ '' . STO
* Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression . STO
* `` I was just _RARE_ to him that I'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' . STO
* Mr. Crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing . STO
* `` Oh , that's wonderful '' , cried Mrs. Crombie . STO
* `` I have a thousand things for you to do . STO
* _RARE_ that won't open , and doors that won't close and shelves and broken -- '' `` But those are the things I built the workshop for '' , protested Mr. Crombie . STO
* `` Those are the things I can do , now that I'm set up '' . STO
* `` I've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said . STO
* `` We won't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you don't need to worry -- _RARE_ be plenty more '' . STO
* But the discussion was academic . STO
* Mr. Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink . STO
* _RARE_ Nothing in English has been _RARE_ as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences . STO
* Ben _RARE_ said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. _RARE_ . STO
* You explain English by Greek '' . STO
* Richard _RARE_ _RARE_ said , `` I think the _RARE_ is the hardest to be understood of the two '' . STO
* And a _RARE_ American _RARE_ remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can't understand his own meaning '' . STO
* There are many types of _RARE_ and many of them have been described by _RARE_ under such names as _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and other _RARE_ . STO
* In common _RARE_ they would be described as _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* One species of _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ by _RARE_ repetition . STO
* `` Did you or did you not say what I said you said , because Jane said you never said what I said '' ? STO
* Another woman , _RARE_ Christmas cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we '' ? STO
* Such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse _RARE_ , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of a _RARE_ kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in . STO
* `` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a _RARE_ . STO
* `` I wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I didn't mean to _RARE_ my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have misunderstood me '' . STO
* _RARE_ Bill was another of those men who simply don't understand women . STO
* Another case involves a newspaper reporter who _RARE_ up a politician . STO
* `` Mr. Jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having _RARE_ the contradiction of your original statement . STO
* Now would you care to have us say that you were _RARE_ in regard to it '' ? STO
* _RARE_ like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever _RARE_ an experienced politician . STO
* They recall _RARE_ classic comment : `` I wish he would explain his explanation '' . STO
* Similarly , when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in _RARE_ fashion , Lincoln refused to make any further statement . STO
* `` I fear explanations _RARE_ of things explained '' , he said , leaving the _RARE_ bit -- and bitter . STO
* The _RARE_ of _RARE_ may not always be as innocent as it looks . STO
* `` Senator '' , said an _RARE_ , `` your constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' . STO
* `` Good '' ! STO
* _RARE_ the Senator . STO
* `` It took me five hours to write it that way '' . STO
* The misplaced modifier is another species more _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ than in the _RARE_ . STO
* This _RARE_ an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word . STO
* A verse familiar to all _RARE_ is the _RARE_ : `` I saw a man once beat his wife When on a drunken _RARE_ . STO
* Now can you tell me who was drunk -- The man , his wife , or me '' ? STO
* The `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ of vaudeville , another _RARE_ of this sort , had endless variations . STO
* `` There's a man outside with a wooden leg named Smith '' . STO
* `` What's the name of his other leg '' ? STO
* Another stock vaudeville _RARE_ ran : `` Mother is home sick in bed with the doctor '' . STO
* When radio came in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its _RARE_ as a standard device . STO
* `` Do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on '' ? STO
* `` I see the girl but I don't see the car with slacks on '' . STO
* In recent years _RARE_ have discovered this brand of _RARE_ and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the _RARE_ . STO
* In one _RARE_ a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family _RARE_ the _RARE_ : `` _RARE_ me , but when we came out we found that we had left my _RARE_ _RARE_ and my wife's behind '' . STO
* _RARE_ supplies us with an endless run of such _RARE_ . STO
* Not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that `` _RARE_ must be of a person not larger than Af inches '' . STO
* _RARE_ ads are also _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal _RARE_ , like the ad in a California paper that advertised `` House for rent . STO
* _RARE_ takes in five counties , two _RARE_ '' . STO
* Since _RARE_ is the soul of _RARE_ as well as wit , newspaper _RARE_ continually provide us with amusing samples . STO
* `` _RARE_ _RARE_ on _RARE_ . STO
* Many _RARE_ in _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ and _RARE_ of Local _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ from misplaced _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ contributes a wide variety of comic _RARE_ in both editorial and advertising matter . STO
* A weekly newspaper reported a local romance : `` and the couple were married last Saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their _RARE_ '' . STO
* An item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a _RARE_ , adding : `` I personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband '' . STO
* Then there was the _RARE_ ad which read : `` are you getting married or having an affair ? STO
* We have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' . STO
* The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical . STO
* This slip is so-called because its _RARE_ English always seems to refer to a _RARE_ anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say . STO
* _RARE_ : He walked in upon her _RARE_ . STO
* She kissed him _RARE_ upon his _RARE_ . STO
* He kissed her back . STO
* Not without good reason has the anatomical been called _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs . STO
* `` While Henry Morgan was _RARE_ Miss _RARE_ Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr. Morgan on the public square '' . STO
* Such items recall the California _RARE_ who reported an accident involving a movie star : `` The area in which Miss N -- was injured is _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* When a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the _RARE_ _RARE_ , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach '' . STO
* _RARE_ enough , this always brought the house down . STO
* _RARE_ from _RARE_ and vaudeville _RARE_ , the anatomical is also found in _RARE_ literature . STO
* A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor . STO
* Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's notes on an emergency case . STO
* It read : `` _RARE_ in the _RARE_ region '' . STO
* After a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she _RARE_ into the record : `` _RARE_ in the woods '' . STO
* There are many grammatical _RARE_ other than _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ which permit two different interpretations . STO
* At the home of a _RARE_ the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving . STO
* `` I want the fish served whole , with head and tail '' , the _RARE_ explained , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' . STO
* The maid _RARE_ . STO
* `` That's silly -- lemon in mouth '' , she said . STO
* But since the _RARE_ insisted that it is done that way at the most _RARE_ dinners , the girl _RARE_ agreed . STO
* So she brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth . STO
* Another specimen of such _RARE_ is illustrated by a woman in a department store . STO
* She said to the _RARE_ , `` I want a dress to put on around the house '' . STO
* The puzzled _RARE_ inquired , `` How large is your house , _RARE_ '' ? STO
* This _RARE_ was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department . STO
* When a customer asked for _RARE_ shoes , she said , `` What size is your _RARE_ '' ? STO
* The comic indefinite _RARE_ an extensive class of comedy . STO
* One species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person , place , time or thing . STO
* A woman met a famous author at a literary tea . STO
* `` Oh , I'm so delighted to meet you '' , she _RARE_ . STO
* `` It was only the other day that I saw something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine '' . STO
* This _RARE_ lack of distinct details _RARE_ the secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence . STO
* `` I may be back '' , he explained , `` and then again , I may not '' . STO
* The girl nodded _RARE_ . STO
* `` Yes , sir '' , she said , `` is that definite '' ? STO
* An _RARE_ mother said to her modern daughter , `` You must have gotten in quite late last night , dear . STO
* Where were you '' ? STO
* The daughter replied , `` Oh , I had dinner with -- well , you don't know him but he's awfully nice -- and we went to a couple of places -- I don't suppose you've heard of them -- and we finished up at a _RARE_ little night club -- I forget the name of it . STO
* Why , it's all right , isn't it , Mother '' ? STO
* Her _RARE_ parent agreed . STO
* `` Of course , dear '' , she said . STO
* `` It's only that I like to know where you go '' . STO
* No less ambiguous was the _RARE_ of a certain _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` _RARE_ beloved '' , he _RARE_ , `` unless you _RARE_ of your _RARE_ in a measure , and become converted to a degree , you will , I regret to say , be damned to a more or less extent '' . STO
* This _RARE_ should have referred to _RARE_ _RARE_ : `` _RARE_ is a good , very good , very excellent _RARE_ . STO
* And yet it is not . STO
* It is but _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ reference also carries _RARE_ where an _RARE_ to one person or thing seems to refer to another . STO
* A news item described the _RARE_ of a ship : `` _RARE_ the ceremony , the beautiful movie star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea '' . STO
* This is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor pool : `` Four _RARE_ to Fort Mason _RARE_ , _RARE_ tonight , for _RARE_ girls to dance . STO
* The bodies must be cleaned and _RARE_ wiped off '' . STO
* A politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died . STO
* `` What are my chances for taking _RARE_ place '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` If you can fix it up with the _RARE_ '' , returned the politician , `` it's all right with me '' . STO
* The manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally indefinite . STO
* `` What have you got on today '' ? STO
* She inquired . STO
* `` A blue suit '' , he answered . STO
* `` Who's in it '' ? STO
* She continued . STO
* `` I am '' , he said . STO
* There was a short pause for reflection . STO
* `` Oh '' , said the woman , `` I've seen that picture already '' . STO
* Another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double _RARE_ . STO
* When a question contains two verbs , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered . STO
* The _RARE_ night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her _RARE_ for some time . STO
* Finally he asked , `` Do you object to _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` That's one thing I've never done '' , she said promptly . STO
* He thought a moment , then inquired , `` You mean _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` No '' , she smiled , `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* _RARE_ to _RARE_ for character reference are _RARE_ for their _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It would be hard to find anything more _RARE_ than : `` I cannot recommend him too highly '' . STO
* Another less ambiguous case read as follows : `` The _RARE_ of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction . STO
* If you are thinking of giving him a _RARE_ , be sure to make it a wide one '' . STO
* In the comedy of indefinite reference , _RARE_ _RARE_ a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence . STO
* _RARE_ arises when the _RARE_ it carries a _RARE_ reference . STO
* Two friends were talking . STO
* One said , `` When I get a cold I buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a few hours it's gone '' . STO
* The speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold . STO
* _RARE_ is a _RARE_ because it covers _RARE_ as well as wit . STO
* An excited woman was making an emergency call over the phone : `` _RARE_ , please come over right away . STO
* My husband is in great pain . STO
* I called the other afternoon on my old friend , _RARE_ Moreland , the _RARE_ literary _RARE_ -- his mother was born in Ohio -- who lives alone in a _RARE_ cottage on the _RARE_ _RARE_ , raising hell and _RARE_ , the former only when the _RARE_ gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is _RARE_ and _RARE_ , such as human _RARE_ , hope , and humor . STO
* My _RARE_ friend does not believe that human _RARE_ is _RARE_ in terms of speed , momentum , _RARE_ , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . STO
* After _RARE_ became the _RARE_ Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe in the _RARE_ of personality or in _RARE_ , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . STO
* A _RARE_ place is in the _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand . STO
* `` I seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live . STO
* Did you go to their funeral '' ? STO
* `` I was wrong '' , I admitted . STO
* `` _RARE_ didn't die , it just went crazy . STO
* It has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to _RARE_ . STO
* We now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of _RARE_ but we also have horror jokes , magazines known as _RARE_ _RARE_ , and sick _RARE_ . STO
* There are even publications called _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ is not crazy as a _RARE_ or mad as a March _RARE_ ; ; it is _RARE_ as a man '' . STO
* `` I woke up this morning '' , Moreland said , `` _RARE_ Lewis _RARE_ . STO
* Do you want to hear the _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` Can I bear it '' ? STO
* I asked , taking a final _RARE_ of my drink , and _RARE_ him the empty glass . STO
* `` Just barely '' , he said , and repeated his _RARE_ : `` The time has come '' , the _RARE_ said , `` To speak of _RARE_ things , Of shots and shouts , and _RARE_ _RARE_ Of _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' . STO
* Moreland fixed us each another drink , and said , `` For God's sake , tell me something truly amusing '' . STO
* `` I'll try '' , I said , and sat for a moment thinking . STO
* `` Oh yes , the other day I _RARE_ some of _RARE_ English _RARE_ , and there was an _RARE_ about a group of English and Americans visiting Germany , more than a hundred years ago . STO
* In the _RARE_ station at _RARE_ , a _RARE_ attendant was _RARE_ , ' _RARE_ this way ! STO
* _RARE_ this way ' ! STO
* One woman -- she could have been either English or American -- went up to him and said , ' But you are the _RARE_ ' '' . STO
* I took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink , and said , `` I admit that going back to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy '' . STO
* `` What's the matter with the music '' ? STO
* Moreland asked . STO
* `` It doesn't _RARE_ out the _RARE_ '' , I explained . STO
* `` Let's talk about books '' , Moreland said . STO
* `` I am told that in America you have _RARE_ by _RARE_ , brought out by _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* Is it all _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` There is _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* `` _RARE_ of _RARE_ : the other day , in a story about a _RARE_ demonstration , the Paris Herald Tribune wrote , ' The _RARE_ became _RARE_ . STO
* And then _RARE_ was quoted as saying , in _RARE_ , that _RARE_ plan to _RARE_ the Jews was _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` If we cannot tell evil , horror , and _RARE_ from _RARE_ , what is the future of humor and comedy '' ? STO
* Moreland asked , grimly . STO
* `` _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* `` They require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? STO
* In our present era of Science and _RARE_ , the heart has been _RARE_ , to use one of our popular _RARE_ verbs '' . STO
* `` I know what you mean '' , Moreland sighed . STO
* `` Last year your Tennessee Williams told our _RARE_ Powell , in a television program , that it is the task of the _RARE_ to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart . STO
* Like almost everybody else , he confused the heart , both as _RARE_ and as symbol , with the disturbed _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ central nervous system . STO
* I'm not pleading for the heart that _RARE_ up when it _RARE_ a _RARE_ in the sky , or for the heart that with _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ with the _RARE_ . STO
* The sentimental pure heart of _RARE_ is gone with the _RARE_ years , but I still believe in the heart of the George Meredith character that was not made of the stuff that _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` We no longer have Tom _RARE_ and _RARE_ ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , I said . STO
* `` Moore and _RARE_ didn't have the fate that faces us '' , Moreland said . STO
* `` One day our species promises _RARE_ , and the next day it _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* We sat for a while drinking in silence . STO
* `` The heart '' , I said finally , `` is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes . STO
* When it was worn in the breast , or even on the sleeve , we at least knew where it was '' . STO
* There was a long silence . STO
* `` You have visited England five times in the past _RARE_ , I believe '' , my host said . STO
* `` What has impressed you most on your present visit '' ? STO
* `` I would say depressed , not impressed '' , I told him . STO
* `` I should say it is the turning of courts of law into _RARE_ _RARE_ for sex _RARE_ , involving _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ and patients . STO
* It is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political _RARE_ from the modern theatre '' . STO
* `` Do you think we need a new Henry James to _RARE_ the _RARE_ scene '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* `` Or perhaps a new _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ? STO
* `` But you must have heard it said that the _RARE_ disappeared forever with the _RARE_ years of James and the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* I myself hear it said constantly -- in _RARE_ . STO
* In them , there is usually a group of _RARE_ with _RARE_ problems , worthy of being _RARE_ either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and _RARE_ '' . STO
* I stood up and began _RARE_ . STO
* `` If you are trying to get us out of the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the kitchen sink , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ , you are probably _RARE_ your time '' , Moreland told me . STO
* `` Too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the _RARE_ or from under the rock '' . STO
* `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* `` I am worried about the current meanings of the word funny . STO
* It now means ominous , as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor ; ; disturbing , as when one says that a friend is acting funny ; ; and _RARE_ , as when a wife tells the police that it is funny , but her husband hasn't been home for two days and nights '' . STO
* Moreland sat brooding for a full minute , during which I made each of us a new drink . STO
* He took his glass , _RARE_ it against mine , and said , `` _RARE_ _RARE_ , what the hell '' ! STO
* _RARE_ a line from _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` Be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change . STO
* It now means , in my country , _RARE_ '' , I said . STO
* `` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was _RARE_ '' . STO
* My host went over and stared out the window at his _RARE_ ; ; then he turned to me . STO
* `` Is it true that you believe the other animals are _RARE_ than the human species '' ? STO
* `` Oh , that is _RARE_ '' , I told him . STO
* `` Do you remember the woman in the French _RARE_ who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened _RARE_ ? STO
* She told the sheep , ' The world is coming to an end ' ! STO
* And the sheep said -- all in _RARE_ , I have no doubt -- _RARE_ ! STO
* The sound _RARE_ of sheep is like the _RARE_ horse laugh '' . STO
* `` That is only partly _RARE_ '' , he began . STO
* `` If you saw the drama called _RARE_ '' , I said , `` think of the effect it would have on an audience of _RARE_ when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ would panic , screaming help ! STO
* -- if that can be screamed in their language '' . STO
* `` You think the _RARE_ are getting ahead of us in comedy '' ? STO
* Moreland demanded . STO
* `` _RARE_ , no '' , I said . STO
* `` The political and intellectual _RARE_ began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such as _RARE_ and irony , such as humor and comedy . STO
* Nevertheless , like any other human being upon whom the _RARE_ of the world plays continually , _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , has become a comic actor , or thinks he has . STO
* In his famous meeting with _RARE_ a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as Ed _RARE_ . STO
* But , like _RARE_ , he has only one joke , so far as I can find out . STO
* It consists in saying , ' That would be sending the _RARE_ to look after the _RARE_ . STO
* Why in the name of his _RARE_ doesn't he vary it a bit '' ? STO
* `` Such as '' ? STO
* Moreland asked . STO
* `` Such as ' sending the cat to guard the mice ' , or ' the _RARE_ to protect the _RARE_ ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human being to save humanity ' '' . STO
* `` You and I have fallen out of literature into politics '' , Moreland observed . STO
* `` What a _RARE_ fall was there '' ! STO
* I said . STO
* Moreland went over to stare at his _RARE_ again , and then came back and sat down , _RARE_ . STO
* `` The world that was once _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' , he said , `` has now become _RARE_ and _RARE_ . STO
* In our age of Science and _RARE_ it seems to me more brave to stay on Earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space '' . STO
* `` The human ego being what it is '' , I put in , `` science _RARE_ has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic _RARE_ fruit _RARE_ . STO
* It seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species '' . STO
* `` Now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again '' , Moreland protested . STO
* `` Not in the largest sense of the words '' , I said . STO
* `` The other day _RARE_ _RARE_ spoke against the _RARE_ tendency of our species to believe in the _RARE_ of its religions , its _RARE_ , and its virtually everything else . STO
* Why do we not realize that no _RARE_ believes so much in itself as it _RARE_ in something else ? STO
* _RARE_ years ago an English writer , W. L. George , dealt with this subject in _RARE_ of the Day , and said , as an example , that ' Saint George for _RARE_ England ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ dead ' '' ! STO
* `` There was also _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , or if you will , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It isn't what the _RARE_ believes in , but what he _RARE_ , that puts the world in _RARE_ . STO
* This is the force , in our time and in every other time , that _RARE_ the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ to become head of a state . STO
* _RARE_ power not only _RARE_ but it also _RARE_ the mad . STO
* There is a bitter _RARE_ for a future writer in that '' . STO
* `` Great _RARE_ has always been clearly written and readily understandable '' , I said . STO
* `` But we now find writers _RARE_ by the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of their ivory _RARE_ , and curiously devoted to the growing _RARE_ and complexity of poetry and _RARE_ . STO
* I wrote a few years ago that one of the _RARE_ rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about . STO
* One day , the children had wanted to get up onto General _RARE_ horse . STO
* They wanted to see what his back felt like -- the _RARE_ . STO
* He looked so comfortable being straight . STO
* They wanted to touch the mystery . STO
* Arlene was _RARE_ them up when the policeman came by . STO
* He was very _RARE_ . STO
* Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time . STO
* The _RARE_ eyes rather _RARE_ for a second ; ; but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` If it wasn't for these dear children '' -- . STO
* The policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` Now , look here , lady : I know you got to _RARE_ these kids and all . STO
* But this is a public park and it's a city _RARE_ that the _RARE_ cannot be crawled on '' . STO
* Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' . STO
* The policeman walked on , but he looked back once . STO
* That had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred . STO
* Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ; and they had told their mother about the _RARE_ . STO
* In matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; ; and so they were consistently true to their principles . STO
* `` Never mind '' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having _RARE_ the usual _RARE_ course of _RARE_ . STO
* `` Never mind . STO
* I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' . STO
* `` What is it '' ? STO
* Asked the children , whose _RARE_ and replies were invariably so _RARE_ normal and predictable . STO
* Maybe that was why they were _RARE_ and loyal towards the _RARE_ of Arlene . STO
* `` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , _RARE_ the _RARE_ in a recent British movie . STO
* And when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most _RARE_ magnificent time . STO
* First , Arlene had put them through some rapid _RARE_ . STO
* They had protested that that wasn't any surprise . STO
* `` Just you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were _RARE_ the pleasantly _RARE_ _RARE_ of that _RARE_ little sturdy statement . STO
* `` This is a _RARE_ '' . STO
* `` Is it anything like _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ? STO
* Asked one of the children . STO
* `` Not the least bit '' , Arlene snapped . STO
* One of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions . STO
* Those were especially the ones that all other _RARE_ laughed at _RARE_ . STO
* She would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously . STO
* But not hard for very long . STO
* Just long enough to make you feel important . STO
* `` Now '' , said Arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms _RARE_ down and feel comfortable . STO
* `` Now , we're going to be like what General Burnside and his horse make us think of '' . STO
* The children looked at each other and _RARE_ their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever . STO
* Their curiosity went happily out of _RARE_ . STO
* Then , Arlene threw herself _RARE_ and _RARE_ in a way that was just wonderful . STO
* She held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked . STO
* `` Imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said . STO
* They both laughed and winked back . STO
* `` I'm General _RARE_ horse , _RARE_ down '' , Arlene said , sort of _RARE_ , for her : even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position . STO
* She made General _RARE_ _RARE_ belly do so funny when it was _RARE_ down . STO
* Then , she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) . STO
* And she would wink and throw _RARE_ . STO
* They both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble . STO
* But they kept on clapping for a long , long time . STO
* `` This time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept on _RARE_ a little bit while she was just talking , `` you're going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing . STO
* It all has something to do with General Burnside and his horse '' . STO
* This time , it was so grand ; ; they could tell exactly what it was . STO
* It was General _RARE_ horse running in a circle . STO
* His legs shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders . STO
* `` That's the _RARE_ horse '' , one of them cried out . STO
* The other remarked , in a happy laughter , `` That's a funny old horse '' . STO
* The first one said , `` He sure does shake . STO
* He's old '' . STO
* Then there was the General kissing his wife . STO
* They had to be told that one . STO
* But it was even _RARE_ after they had been told . STO
* Their father , when he came back from those many business trips , just _RARE_ their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to _RARE_ the _RARE_ and put them in the electric _RARE_ . STO
* But not General Burnside . STO
* He was the _RARE_ man . STO
* He never could keep still , even when he didn't move his feet . STO
* Then , they had to get up and be General Burnside . STO
* Or his horse . STO
* All they could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out . STO
* It wasn't very funny . STO
* Then , they said General Burnside was going to jump over his _RARE_ head ; ; and they did some _RARE_ . STO
* But that wasn't very funny , either . STO
* `` You ought to shake '' , Arlene advised them . STO
* And Arlene showed them how to begin . STO
* She also taught them to sing `` I wish I could _RARE_ like my sister Kate '' . STO
* That helped a lot . STO
* They were _RARE_ , but they were beginning to catch on . STO
* They also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling . STO
* `` Imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling -- or smiling with your lips trembling too much '' , Arlene suggested . STO
* That helped a great deal . STO
* They were a little late in getting home . STO
* `` I'm sorry , Mrs. _RARE_ '' , Arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it . STO
* My mother _RARE_ herself the voice of all of us . STO
* `` It's perfectly understandable , Arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way . STO
* `` I suppose you all were playing and forgot '' ? STO
* `` Yes , _RARE_ '' , the children _RARE_ heartily . STO
* We couldn't help laughing . STO
* The children rushed off to get rid of their _RARE_ ; ; and Arlene began _RARE_ the kitchen door open . STO
* `` _RARE_ a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; ; but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded . STO
* That tap had a slight _RARE_ quality . STO
* `` She really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed . STO
* Her upper lip lifted slightly . STO
* She was _RARE_ into a small red radish ; ; and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the _RARE_ of the thing . STO
* Also , she lived in _RARE_ fear of finding a white _RARE_ curled up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish . STO
* She would try to see over the _RARE_ of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was _RARE_ . STO
* It never worked , naturally ; ; but it made her look unusual . STO
* Also , when she had _RARE_ off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; ; and she would _RARE_ the _RARE_ half of the radish out to where she could inspect it . STO
* One could hear a very faint , _RARE_ sigh of relief . STO
* Actually , it was _RARE_ to anyone not expecting it . STO
* But the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public . STO
* Later on , the children told her further about _RARE_ . STO
* `` It must be awfully good for them . STO
* And awfully kind of Arlene '' , she told us later . STO
* `` But do you know something curious '' ? STO
* She added . STO
* `` I reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress . STO
* I have no notion why I reached . STO
* And I found a radish . STO
* Was it an _RARE_ ? STO
* I thought for a second . STO
* But I would not _RARE_ myself in that silly way . STO
* I opened the window and threw the radish out '' . STO
* Then , my mother blushed at this small lie ; ; for she knew and we knew that it was _RARE_ that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain . STO
* Arlene became _RARE_ ; ; nobody could have told why . STO
* But she was . STO
* It was in the air . STO
* A friend of my father's came to dinner . STO
* He was passing through town and phoned to say _RARE_ . STO
* As a result , he was persuaded out to dinner . STO
* As a matter of fact , this happened every four or five months . STO
* Sometimes , he _RARE_ with my father's being at home . STO
* Sometimes , as at this _RARE_ , he did not . STO
* But he was always persuaded out . STO
* He liked children , in a _RARE_ kind of way ; ; the two _RARE_ in our family always had to be brought in and put through _RARE_ for his entertainment . STO
* When he had left , I could never remember whether he had _RARE_ them in their _RARE_ , _RARE_ , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . STO
* The children _RARE_ him , too . STO
* This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them . STO
* There had been some _RARE_ in it , for I remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a _RARE_ bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish with a _RARE_ . STO
* They were pushed gently into the room by Arlene -- whose only part _RARE_ were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door . STO
* We had just sat down . STO
* `` Tell Mr. Gorboduc what you're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , _RARE_ . STO
* There was an air of _RARE_ about the children -- even _RARE_ for their own principles . STO
* This could be told chiefly from a sort of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , the _RARE_ dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration . STO
* But , at the beginning , this stayed just in the air . STO
* `` We go to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them said . STO
* `` We have good times '' . STO
* This happy _RARE_ _RARE_ Mr. Gorboduc . STO
* `` You do '' ? STO
* He asked , between _RARE_ of laughter . STO
* He was forced to wipe his eyes . STO
* `` You don't step on the flowers , do you ? STO
* _RARE_ '' ? STO
* One of the children _RARE_ out of range of the _RARE_ index finger . STO
* `` No '' , he said . STO
* `` We don't '' . STO
* Mr. Gorboduc took a _RARE_ of his _RARE_ . STO
* He was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her _RARE_ for _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , this was done when attention was _RARE_ by someone _RARE_ long , _RARE_ story . STO
* But this time she was nervous : she was open . STO
* Mr. Gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again . STO
* `` Tell me -- what do you do at the park '' ? STO
* He asked . STO
* This was delivered in a _RARE_ way , without _RARE_ and _RARE_ interest -- an _RARE_ way with children . STO
* Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging _RARE_ of the direct command . STO
* This _RARE_ the children into the _RARE_ of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret _RARE_ over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* `` We _RARE_ '' , one said ; ; and the other went on to development of the idea . STO
* `` We _RARE_ , too '' , he said . STO
* My mother was beside herself with curiosity . STO
* `` _RARE_ that again '' , she _RARE_ . STO
* She laughed a little and tossed the _RARE_ _RARE_ around in her glass . STO
* `` You what '' ? STO
* She could see that Mr. Gorboduc was _RARE_ ; ; the hostess in her took over . STO
* She was _RARE_ happy . STO
* `` You what '' ? STO
* My uncle looked at Mr. Gorboduc . STO
* He read Henry James and used to pretend _RARE_ through _RARE_ at people . STO
* Mr. Gorboduc looked down . STO
* He would not look up . STO
* He was very funny about the whole thing . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ de _RARE_ ad _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ set in the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ War Rome . STO
* _RARE_ , the hero , is _RARE_ from all sides by the problems of approaching manhood . STO
* The story opens on the _RARE_ of his _RARE_ birthday , as he _RARE_ for the two weeks of _RARE_ that are to follow . STO
* Suddenly , a _RARE_ _RARE_ and , just before _RARE_ dead at his feet , _RARE_ him that the _RARE_ have _RARE_ _RARE_ , the home _RARE_ of his _RARE_ . STO
* He at once _RARE_ the _RARE_ and , _RARE_ on his _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ from the house , where he is hit and killed by a passing _RARE_ . STO
* The Albany _RARE_ _RARE_ presentation of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , with guest _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* An unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue of _RARE_ from the rock by the U.S. _RARE_ was given last week in the _RARE_ of the Albany _RARE_ _RARE_ Company _RARE_ _RARE_ of `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* After a `` busy '' _RARE_ , the curtain rises on a farm scene -- the _RARE_ Valley in northern _RARE_ . STO
* A dead _RARE_ , the sole _RARE_ of the stage , _RARE_ the crisis and destruction of the Old Order . STO
* Old Order , acted and _RARE_ sung by _RARE_ _RARE_ , the lovely _RARE_ import , then entered and delivered the well-known _RARE_ to the god _RARE_ , _RARE_ the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ Love , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and General Motors , respectively . STO
* According to the myth , Old Order then _RARE_ at stage left and _RARE_ at extreme stage right , but Director _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ the rather _RARE_ problem of stage effects by simply having Miss _RARE_ walk across the stage . STO
* The night he saw it , a rather _RARE_ situation arose when the _RARE_ refused to approach the _RARE_ , _RARE_ -- in _RARE_ -- that `` it smelled '' . STO
* We caught the early train to New York . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ , a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* It's somewhat off the beaten track , to be sure , but therein lies its variety and charm . STO
* For example , probably very few people know that the word `` _RARE_ '' that is _RARE_ about so much today stems from the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' : to _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely _RARE_ as `` _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ '' , and the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' all originated in the same village in _RARE_ _RARE_ and are all used to express _RARE_ concerning British `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* The terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start _RARE_ them to your date , it might be best to find out if he was a member of Major _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , since resentment toward the _RARE_ was _RARE_ very high in that outfit . STO
* The breeze and _RARE_ _RARE_ , a movie _RARE_ that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to _RARE_ a plaster cast of the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* As you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is _RARE_ with _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ theory . STO
* For example , when the film is only four minutes old , _RARE_ refers to a small , _RARE_ piano stool as `` _RARE_ '' , and we are _RARE_ subjected to a _RARE_ that _RARE_ us that this very piano stool was once used by an _RARE_ _RARE_ whose name , of course , was _RARE_ ( the English equivalent , when passed through _RARE_ _RARE_ , of _RARE_ ) . STO
* For the remainder of the movie , _RARE_ _RARE_ proceeds to _RARE_ the piano stool with a _RARE_ from a _RARE_ blind that used to hang in the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* In this manner , he _RARE_ to _RARE_ from his own soul the guilt _RARE_ caused by his personal _RARE_ against the English at _RARE_ . STO
* As we find out at the end , it is not the stool ( _RARE_ _RARE_ , therefore the English ) that he is _RARE_ but the piece of _RARE_ blind . STO
* And , when the _RARE_ finally _RARE_ , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not '' . STO
* After a few _RARE_ moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera _RARE_ across the room to the plaster _RARE_ , and we realize that _RARE_ is trying to _RARE_ himself in the eyes of a _RARE_ piece of sculpture . STO
* The effect , _RARE_ to say , is almost terrifying , and though at times a bit obscure , the film is certainly a _RARE_ _RARE_ for the `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ . STO
* The music of _RARE_ _RARE_ , capital _RARE_ _RARE_ , one of the rare _RARE_ of this _RARE_ , yet _RARE_ , composer . STO
* Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the _RARE_ _RARE_ in August , _RARE_ , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great _RARE_ lay _RARE_ for so many years , so has the _RARE_ , ingenious _RARE_ passed through his `` _RARE_ '' of neglect . STO
* But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer _RARE_ _RARE_ , Jr. , a major _RARE_ is under way . STO
* As he leads the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ gives a _RARE_ _RARE_ performance of both the _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , including the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , which was included at the _RARE_ insistence . STO
* A major portion of the credit should also go to _RARE_ _RARE_ for his rendering of the almost impossible `` _RARE_ '' movement in the _RARE_ . STO
* Not only was _RARE_ intonation and _RARE_ without _RARE_ , but he seemed to take every tonal _RARE_ in stride . STO
* For example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest _RARE_ register up to a barely _RARE_ N minor in four seconds , not _RARE_ , at the same time , even one of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , seems a _RARE_ too absurd to consider , and it is to the _RARE_ credit that he remained silent throughout the passage . STO
* We would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra _RARE_ from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it _RARE_ an otherwise sober , if not _RARE_ , performance . STO
* As Broadway itself becomes increasingly _RARE_ down by _RARE_ , _RARE_ , commercially successful _RARE_ and _RARE_ problem _RARE_ , the American theatre is going through an _RARE_ _RARE_ in that _RARE_ area known as `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* For the last two years , this _RARE_ of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` _RARE_ '' which have left _RARE_ , _RARE_ impressions on the _RARE_ of this veteran _RARE_ . STO
* The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of this _RARE_ _RARE_ is The , an adaptation of _RARE_ classic _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ , a former University of Maryland chemistry _RARE_ . STO
* Although the play does show a certain structural _RARE_ ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the _RARE_ _RARE_ and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . STO
* The action centers about a group of _RARE_ and _RARE_ students sitting around a table in a _RARE_ and their collective and ultimately _RARE_ search for a cup of hot coffee . STO
* They are _RARE_ _RARE_ on all sides by a _RARE_ , the police , and an _RARE_ government _RARE_ . STO
* The innocence that they tried to _RARE_ at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of _RARE_ pie , gets a plate of English _RARE_ instead . STO
* Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of _RARE_ that life , after all ( as _RARE_ said ) , is just a search for the _RARE_ cup of hot coffee , and that this _RARE_ , moving , _RARE_ , bitter _RARE_ of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since _RARE_ _RARE_ retired . STO
* _RARE_ but still _RARE_ , French _RARE_ _RARE_ terrible _RARE_ _RARE_ has succeeded in _RARE_ _RARE_ old Paris again , this time with a _RARE_ ballet _RARE_ called The _RARE_ _RARE_ , the story of a _RARE_ _RARE_ operator who falls _RARE_ in love with a middle-aged steam shovel . STO
* A _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of modern life , the piece has been set by _RARE_ _RARE_ to a _RARE_ score ( a single _RARE_ played over and over by four thousand French _RARE_ ) by _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , lovely _RARE_ _RARE_ plays the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* Ever since _RARE_ , and , more recently , _RARE_ _RARE_ , there have been a lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , charming , and immensely _RARE_ My _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ in the modern style of a `` confession '' , _RARE_ tells in _RARE_ detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother's _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ . STO
* It is not an entirely happy book , as Mrs. _RARE_ soon becomes _RARE_ of _RARE_ and , in _RARE_ , _RARE_ to continue to _RARE_ the algae off her glass . STO
* Max , in a fit of despair , takes _RARE_ and runs off for two marvelous weeks in _RARE_ ( _RARE_ calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which _RARE_ _RARE_ contracts _RARE_ disease and _RARE_ . STO
* This brief resume hardly does the book justice , but I heartily recommend it to all those who are _RARE_ with the major problems of our time . STO
* _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ , along with _RARE_ , seems to be _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* In this country , the two guiding lights are , without doubt , Felix _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , a lean , _RARE_ , _RARE_ gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir _RARE_ _RARE_ , is responsible for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ earliest , most _RARE_ opera , _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ with a haunting _RARE_ that struck me as being highly _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of `` _RARE_ '' . STO
* Miss _RARE_ has a voice that _RARE_ _RARE_ once described as `` like _RARE_ teeth with a screw driver '' , and her round , _RARE_ face becomes _RARE_ _RARE_ of the emotions demanded by the role of _RARE_ . STO
* The _RARE_ _RARE_ is literally _RARE_ this summer with the _RARE_ bodies of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of all this commotion : squat , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ ugly _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ figure , who plays a _RARE_ , _RARE_ , philosophic _RARE_ salesman in old _RARE_ _RARE_ de _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ film , A _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ has been _RARE_ described as `` a symbol of the new _RARE_ of France and myself '' ( De _RARE_ ) and `` a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ '' ! STO
* ( _RARE_ _RARE_ ) , but no one can deny that the screen _RARE_ with electricity whenever he is on it . STO
* _RARE_ to _RARE_ along with him , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ Italian _RARE_ , turns in a _RARE_ performance as an _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* The battle of the _RARE_ continues , but most of New _RARE_ knowing _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ are _RARE_ their feet impatiently in expectation of V ( for _RARE_ ) Day , September first , when _RARE_ _RARE_ first _RARE_ show opens at the _RARE_ . STO
* We have heard that after seeing Mr. _RARE_ work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . STO
* And it is thought by many who think about such things that _RARE_ is the logical _RARE_ of a school that started with _RARE_ , progressed through _RARE_ and the _RARE_ Picasso , and _RARE_ just recently in Pollock and De _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' . STO
* `` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to _RARE_ _RARE_ and myself , `` the nothing that is behind the something , the _RARE_ , _RARE_ ' _RARE_ ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in _RARE_ '' . STO
* It is his _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ to this _RARE_ artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The _RARE_ of Cuba '' . STO
* In this work , his use of _RARE_ is startling and _RARE_ . STO
* The sweep of space , the delicate _RARE_ of the white masses , the over-all _RARE_ and unity , the originality and imagination , all _RARE_ it to be called an authentic _RARE_ . STO
* I asked _RARE_ recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical _RARE_ way of _RARE_ me for my lack of sensitivity . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ : Let me begin by clearing up any possible _RARE_ in your minds , wherever you are . STO
* The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither _RARE_ nor _RARE_ but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves . STO
* It is , I am _RARE_ given to understand , the technical _RARE_ for those who engage in your particular branch of the _RARE_ ; ; i.e. , _RARE_ who _RARE_ while the tenants are absent , in contrast to _RARE_ _RARE_ , those who work while the occupants are home . STO
* Since the latter obviously require an _RARE_ you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am _RARE_ you as socially _RARE_ . STO
* Far from it ; ; I merely draw an _RARE_ distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a _RARE_ . STO
* Above all , _RARE_ yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your _RARE_ my residence , to _RARE_ over the loss of a few _RARE_ _RARE_ , or to shame you into _RARE_ . STO
* My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the _RARE_ implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might _RARE_ . STO
* You have _RARE_ set in motion forces so _RARE_ , so _RARE_ , that it would be _RARE_ _RARE_ of me not to _RARE_ you about them . STO
* Quite _RARE_ , fellows , I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the rice in China . STO
* As you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent _RARE_ , permit me to _RARE_ them briefly . STO
* _RARE_ on Saturday evening , August _RARE_ , while my family and I were dining at the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , in Rome , you _RARE_ a window of our home in _RARE_ County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ to the attic , the temperature of which was easily hotter than the _RARE_ Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool _RARE_ , some _RARE_ pants , and the like , and to _RARE_ the _RARE_ boxes and _RARE_ stored there . STO
* What you were looking for ( unless you make a _RARE_ of collecting old tennis _RARE_ and fly screens ) _RARE_ me , but to judge from _RARE_ records scattered about a _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* You danced two _RARE_ and a _RARE_ _RARE_ , which must have been fairly _RARE_ in that _RARE_ . STO
* You then descended one story , _RARE_ a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit , by the way -- and , returning to the ground floor , entered the master bedroom . STO
* From the _RARE_ _RARE_ on its south wall and the _RARE_ beneath , you _RARE_ seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone _RARE_ of _RARE_ and African origin , two _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ glass . STO
* _RARE_ through a stack of _RARE_ nearby , you _RARE_ an antique French _RARE_ set in ivory and _RARE_ , which , along with two box _RARE_ , you added to your _RARE_ . STO
* Then , having wrapped the lot in an _RARE_ my dog _RARE_ slept on , you _RARE_ out the front door , _RARE_ leaving it open for neighbors to discover . STO
* So much for the _RARE_ facts , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the _RARE_ and state _RARE_ who followed in your wake . STO
* The foregoing , aided by several clues I'll _RARE_ to keep you on your toes , will pursue you with a _RARE_ worthy of Inspector _RARE_ , but before they close in , _RARE_ yourselves , I repeat , for a _RARE_ _RARE_ more _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ of the _RARE_ you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your _RARE_ begin to _RARE_ and your hair falls out in patches . STO
* In time , these minor manifestations will _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ you with _RARE_ , the _RARE_ evil , sheep _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release . STO
* All this , though , is simply a _RARE_ , a _RARE_ , for what _RARE_ , and I doubt whether any _RARE_ could accurately forecast it . STO
* If , however , it would help to _RARE_ your _RARE_ , I can _RARE_ the powers of a few of the _RARE_ you've _RARE_ and describe the punishment they _RARE_ out in one _RARE_ instance . STO
* Hold on tight . STO
* First of all , the six figures of the Buddha you _RARE_ -- four _RARE_ heads , a black _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ position , and a large brass figure of the _RARE_ Buddha on a _RARE_ base . STO
* Now , you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord Buddha is the most _RARE_ of the gods , much more so than _RARE_ and _RARE_ and the rest . STO
* _RARE_ up -- don't you ? STO
* Well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the _RARE_ of the Law _RARE_ ) toward _RARE_ folk who _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ the _RARE_ . STO
* Very peculiar _RARE_ indeed seems to _RARE_ such _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ or ten years ago , a couple of French _RARE_ _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_ head from the _RARE_ _RARE_ , in Paris , and a week later crawled into the _RARE_ with _RARE_ symptoms of _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ own amount of _RARE_ oil did nothing to _RARE_ their _RARE_ ; ; they _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ One to forgive their _RARE_ . STO
* Any _RARE_ French _RARE_ can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I'll presently _RARE_ a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let's resume our _RARE_ . STO
* Whether the pair of _RARE_ ivory _RARE_ you lifted really possess the _RARE_ to turn your _RARE_ to lead , as a _RARE_ in _RARE_ assured me , I am not competent to say . STO
* _RARE_ the ivory _RARE_ female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( _RARE_ _RARE_ ) ; ; a friend of mine _RARE_ her from the _RARE_ _RARE_ for inspection was _RARE_ as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of _RARE_ . STO
* The three Indian brass _RARE_ , though -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ -- are an altogether different cup of tea . STO
* They _RARE_ from _RARE_ , a state in the _RARE_ where _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of death , is _RARE_ . STO
* Have you ever heard of _RARE_ ? STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ . STO
* But it is the wooden sculpture from _RARE_ , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies _RARE_ by a fish , that I particularly call to your attention . STO
* _RARE_ enough , this is an _RARE_ against _RARE_ , presented to the _RARE_ and me by a local _RARE_ in 1949 . STO
* _RARE_ around its base is a charm in _RARE_ , a dialect I take it you don't _RARE_ . STO
* Neither do I , but the _RARE_ _RARE_ was good enough to translate , and I'll do as much for you . STO
* _RARE_ _RARE_ our _RARE_ , the _RARE_ states , can expect _RARE_ sorrow . STO
* The teeth will rain from his mouth like _RARE_ , his wife will make him _RARE_ with _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ car will grow in his stomach . STO
* Furthermore -- and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note -- it shall _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ to throw away or _RARE_ of their _RARE_ . STO
* The cycle of _RARE_ starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them _RARE_ the _RARE_ generation . STO
* _RARE_ of _RARE_ , isn't it ? STO
* Still , there it is . STO
* Now , you no doubt regard the preceding as _RARE_ ; ; you're _RARE_ around full of _RARE_ in your hot _RARE_ , _RARE_ yourselves on _RARE_ and playing _RARE_ in the _RARE_ and generally _RARE_ like _RARE_ . STO
* In that case , listen to what _RARE_ another _RARE_ who _RARE_ with our _RARE_ . STO
* A couple of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of _RARE_ called a `` coffin turn '' . STO
* In it was a stone _RARE_ Buddha I had picked up in _RARE_ , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I _RARE_ it with flowers or laid a few _RARE_ in its lap . STO
* After a while , we became aware that the money was _RARE_ as fast as we _RARE_ it . STO
* Our _RARE_ eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a _RARE_ boy , a thoroughly bad hat , who delivered _RARE_ to the people overhead . STO
* The more I _RARE_ into this young man's activities and character , the less _RARE_ I found him . STO
* I learned , for example , that he made a practice of _RARE_ at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of _RARE_ salt on the icy pavement to _RARE_ their feet . STO
* His energy was _RARE_ ; ; sometimes he would be up before dawn , _RARE_ as a _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ into _RARE_ to _RARE_ us , and thereafter would hurry to the _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ at the _RARE_ and press cigar _RARE_ against their _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , he was frequently to be seen at _RARE_ like _RARE_ & _RARE_ or Peter's _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ladies' hats and singing `` O _RARE_ _RARE_ '' . STO
* In short , and to _RARE_ an _RARE_ phrase , _RARE_ timber . STO
* Well , the _RARE_ little _RARE_ went along _RARE_ animals and humans who couldn't _RARE_ , and in due course , as was inevitable , _RARE_ himself . STO
* One morning , we discovered not only that the _RARE_ were missing from the _RARE_ but that a cigarette had been _RARE_ out in its lap . STO
* `` Now he's bought it '' , said my wife _RARE_ . STO
* `` No _RARE_ will hold still for that . STO
* He's really asking for it '' . STO
* And how right she was . STO
* The next time we saw him , he was a changed person ; ; he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of _RARE_ , was _RARE_ with _RARE_ , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire . STO
* Some sort of _RARE_ was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a _RARE_ voice -- either an _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ , we couldn't determine which . STO
* His eyes had the same _RARE_ rigid stare as Dr. _RARE_ _RARE_ when he was found before his open safe wearing the _RARE_ band . STO
* The _RARE_ the youth worked for soon tired of his _RARE_ effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of _RARE_ , and let him go . STO
* The beautiful , the _RARE_ part of his _RARE_ , however , was the _RARE_ way the Buddha polished him off . STO
* _RARE_ to _RARE_ , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer . STO
* His _RARE_ , deficiency of taste , and _RARE_ carried him _RARE_ to the top . STO
* He _RARE_ programs that _RARE_ new depths of _RARE_ and _RARE_ whole _RARE_ , and quickly _RARE_ his boss . STO
* Not long ago , I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio City ; ; he was talking to himself _RARE_ to the dozen and smoking two _RARE_ at once , clearly a man in _RARE_ . STO
* `` See that guy '' ? STO
* The operator asked _RARE_ . STO
* `` I wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in China . STO
* There's some kind of a _RARE_ haunting his footsteps '' . STO
* However one looks at it , therefore , I'd say that your _RARE_ for this autumn is the reverse of _RARE_ . STO
* The inventory you acquired from me isn't going to be easy to move ; ; you can't very well _RARE_ up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot _RARE_ . STO
* _RARE_ , since you're going to be _RARE_ de combat pretty soon with _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ boil , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , liver _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and a host of other _RARE_ of the _RARE_ you've aroused , you mustn't expect to be _RARE_ socially . STO
* My advice , if you live long enough to continue your _RARE_ , is that the next time you're attracted by the _RARE_ , pass it up -- it's nothing but a _RARE_ . STO
* As you can count on me to do the same . STO
* _RARE_ yours , S. J. _RARE_ _RARE_ in the desert the doors of the D train slid shut , and as I dropped into a seat and , _RARE_ , looked up across the _RARE_ , the whole _RARE_ in my head burst into song . STO
* She was a living _RARE_ and no mistake -- the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the wide cheekbones , _RARE_ , that betrayed the _RARE_ strain in her _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the mouth whose only fault , in the _RARE_ _RARE_ phrase , was that the lower lip was a trifle too _RARE_ . STO
